As part of the wildly successful and much-loved duo French and Saunders, Dawn helped create a repetoire of brilliantly observed characters, parodying popular culture and impersonating everything from Harry Potter to <i>The Exorcist</i>. Dawn's recent role in the <i>Vicar of Dibley</i> showcased both her talent&nbsp;and also her ability to take a controversial issue and make it mainstream&#x2014;and very funny.

You will be surprised to discover much about Wesley that you never knew, his skills in organizing prayer groups, his writing of over 200 books, how he established free health clinics for the poor, supported the abolition of slavery, and even his painful failure at marriage. His preaching among average citizens assured that the Wesleyan movement would grow into one of the largest evangelical movements in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today&#39;s Christians can learn much from his life.</p><p>Dr. H. Newton Malony is a United Methodist Minister and a Clinical Psychologist who has taught in the Graduate School of Psychology at Fuller Theological Seminary since 1969. He has written or edited over 35 books and had a special interest in the relation of John Wesley to psychology. He sees Wesley as a very human leader whose life reflects what it means to always be aware of his limitations while seeking to follow God's will. Dr. Malony spent a year studying Wesley at Oxford&#x2015;the city where Wesley studied and started the Wesleyan movement. He discovered many lesser know facets of Wesley's life that this book reveals.</p><h2>Nilling: Prose Essays on Noise, Pornography, The Codex, Melancholy, Lucretiun, Folds, Cities and Related Aporias (Department of Critical Thought, 6)</h2><p>Literary Nonfiction.

Just beneath the surface of the phonemes, a gendered name rhythmically explodes into a founding variousness. And then the strictures of the text assert again themselves. I want to claim for this inconspicuousness a transformational agency that runs counter to the teleology of readerly intention. Syllables might call to gods who do and don't exist. That is, they appear in the text's absences and densities as a motile graphic and phonemic force that abnegates its own necessity.

The deadliest bounty hunter on the frontier, Flintlock is armed with his grandfather&#x2019;s ancient Hawken muzzleloader, ready to put the blast on the face of injustice. As William and J.A. Johnstone&#x2019;s acclaimed saga continues, Flintlock will discover an evil too terrifying and deadly to even name.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>WHEN A MAN SAYS HE&#x2019;S GOING TO KILL YOU, BELIEVE HIM<br><br></b> The stench of death hangs over Happyville. When Flintlock rides into town, he sees windows caked in dust, food rotting on tables, and a forgotten corpse hanging at the gallows. The citizens of Happyville are dead in their beds, taken down by a deadly scourge, and Flintlock must stay put, or risk spreading the killer disease. His quarantine is broken by Cage Kingfisher, a mad clergyman who preaches the gospel of death. He orders his followers to round up the survivors of Happyville and bring them home to face the very plague they fled. To save them, Flintlock must send Kingfisher to Hell. But the deadly deacon has a clockwork arm that can draw a pistol faster than the eye can blink. It will take the devil to bring him down. Or the frontier legend they call Flintlock.</p><p><b>William W.

He has won both the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Award for fiction. This book derives from the William W. Cook Lectures delivered at the University of Michigan Law School in October, 1986.</p><h2>Indian Why Stories (Dover Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The Native American was a true lover of nature and close observer of the sights and sounds about him. He delighted in composing tales that offered imaginative explanations for everything--from simple stories about creation to fanciful accounts of how animals acquired certain physical characteristics.<br>This entertaining collection of 22 stories, compiled nearly a century ago by a devotee of Indian lore who considered them "well-worth saving," recounts many of the legends told to him by members of the Blackfeet, Chippewa and Cree tribes. Here are intriguing explanations of "How the Ducks Got Their Fine Feathers," "Why the Kingfisher Always Wears a War-Bonnet," "Why the Chipmunk's Back Is Striped," "Why Blackfeet Never Kill Mice," "How the Otter Skin Became Great 'Medicine,'" "Why the Mountain-Lion Is Long and Lean," "How the Man Found His Mate," "Why the Birch-Tree Wears the Slashes in Its Bark" and many other tales rich in fanciful characters.<br>Told in simple, direct language and enhanced with 32 illustrations by famed "cowboy artist" Charles M. Russell, these fables will delight children, lovers of tall tales and students of Native American culture.</p><p>Old-man, or Napa, as he was called by the Blackfeet, is an extraordinary character in Indian stories. Both powerful and fallible, he appears in different guises: god or creator, fool, thief, clown. The world he made is marvelous but filled with mistakes. As a result, tensions between the haves and have-nots explode with cosmic consequences in Indian Why Stories. <p>Elders of the Blackfeet, Cree, and Chippewa (Ojibwa) people shared these wonderful tales with Frank B. Linderman in the late nineteenth century and early years of the twentieth century. War Eagle (the fictional name of Linderman&#x2019;s friend and Chippewa medicine man Pah-nah-to, or Full-of-dew), tells these stories to attentive youngsters after the first frost in the fall. He speaks of animal people, including a deer and an antelope in a footrace, a dancing fox who convulses a buffalo with laughter, a white beaver and ghost people, a huge snake in love with the moon, a sparrow hawk of conscience, and many others. These sparkling tales reveal a reverence for life, honesty, and the unity of creation. </p><p>This expanded edition features thirteen previously unpublished verse stories along with an introduction to those stories by Sarah Waller Hatfield, granddaughter of Linderman. </p><p>Frank B. Linderman (1869&#x2013;1938) spent his adult life in Montana, first as a trapper and then as an author, politician, and businessman. He lived closely with the Salish, Blackfeet, Crows, and other Native peoples in the region and is the author of Plenty-coups: Chief of the Crows and Pretty-shield: Medicine Woman of the Crows, both available in Bison Books edition.</p>Frank Bird Linderman (1869-1938) was a Montana writer, politician, Native American ally and ethnographer. Linderman was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He was the child of James Bird Linderman and Mary Ann Brannan Linderman. He attended schools in Ohio and Illinois, including Oberlin College, before moving to Montana Territory in 1885 at the age of sixteen. Frank Linderman went to the shores of Flathead Lake, there he learned Indian ways and lived as they lived. To know them better he mastered the sign language, a feat which gained him the name Sign-talker, or, sometimes Great Sign-talker. From 1893 to 1897, he worked in Butte, Montana, then moved to Brandon, Montana. Around 1900, he moved to Sheridan, Montana, where he worked several jobs, as an assayer, furniture salesman, and at a newspaper. Linderman served in the state Legislature as the representative from Madison County, Montana in 1903 and 1905. He served as Assistant Secretary of State from 1905-07, after moving to the new state capital of Helena in 1905. Through his work, the Rocky Boys Indian Reservation was established by law in 1916.</p><h2>Portugal</h2><p>From the author of the acclaimed <i>Equinoxes </i>comes a return to roots that serves as spiritual renewal. Comics artist Simon Muchat is stuck. Suffering writer&#x2019;s block, uninspired, vegetating as a school art teacher, he is losing direction and his taste for life, until one day he is invited to appear at a comics convention in Portugal, the country his family came from and which he hadn&#x2019;t seen since his childhood. Even though he is a foreigner there, so many elements of the country are familiar to him. Meeting its lively citizens and recounting early memoreis brought by back his distant yet welcoming family all prove reinvigorating&#x2014;the breath of fresh air he so badly needed. Based on his own experience, Pedrosa narrates this return to his roots in a deeply compelling and warmly human way. This bestselling graphic novel has sold more than 100,000 copies in France and a has won many prizes, including Best Graphic Novel at the Angouleme Festival and FNAC Best GN.</p><p><b>Cyril Pedrosa</b>&nbsp;has worked on Disney animated feature films such as <i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i>&nbsp;and <i>Hercules</i>&nbsp;before meeting writer David Chauvel, who inspired him to turn to comics.

Not getting as far in school as he&#x2019;d hoped, at the age of twelve he comes to Istanbul&#x2014;&#x201c;the center of the world&#x201d;&#x2014;and is immediately enthralled by both the old city that is disappearing and the new one that is fast being built. He follows his father&#x2019;s trade, selling boza (a traditional mildly alcoholic Turkish drink) on the street, and hoping to become rich, like other villagers who have settled the desolate hills outside the booming metropolis. But luck never seems to be on Mevlut&#x2019;s side. As he watches his relations settle down and make their fortunes, he spends three years writing love letters to a girl he saw just once at a wedding, only to elope by mistake with her sister. And though he grows to cherish his wife and the family they have, he stumbles toward middle age in a series of jobs leading nowhere. His sense of missing something leads him sometimes to the politics of his friends and intermittently to the teachings of a charismatic religious guide. But every evening, without fail, Mevlut still wanders the streets of Istanbul, selling boza and wondering at the &#x201c;strangeness&#x201d; in his mind, the sensation that makes him feel different from everyone else, until fortune conspires once more to let him understand at last what it is he has always yearned for.<br><br>Told from different perspectives by a host of beguiling characters, <i>A Strangeness in My Mind</i> is a modern epic of coming of age in a great city, a brilliant tableau of life among the newcomers who have changed the face of Istanbul over the past fifty years. Here is a mesmerizing story of human longing, sure to take its place among Pamuk&#x2019;s finest achievements.</p><p><b>ORHAN PAMUK</b>&nbsp;won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006. His novel <i>My Name Is Red</i> won the 2003 IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. His work has been translated into more than sixty languages.Mevlut and Rayiha<br> Elopement Is a Tricky Business<br> &nbsp;<br> THIS IS&nbsp;the story of the life and daydreams of Mevlut Karata&#x15f;, a seller of boza and yogurt. Born in 1957 on the western edge of Asia, in a poor village overlooking a hazy lake in Central Anatolia, he came to Istanbul at the age of twelve, living there, in the capital of the world, for the rest of his life. When he was twenty-five, he returned to the province of his birth, where he eloped with a village girl, a rather strange affair that determined the rest of his days: returning with her to Istanbul, he got married and had two daughters; he took a number of jobs without pause, selling his yogurt, ice cream, and rice in the street and waiting tables. But every evening, without fail, he would wander the streets of Istanbul, selling boza and dreaming strange dreams.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our hero Mevlut was tall, of strong yet delicate build, and good-looking. He had a boyish face, light brown hair, and alert, clever eyes, a combination that roused many a tender feeling among women. This boyishness, which Mevlut carried well into his forties, and its effect on women were two of his essential features, and it will be worth my reminding readers of them now and again to help to explain some aspects of the story. As for Mevlut&#x2019;s optimism and goodwill&#x2014;which some would call na�vet�&#x2014;of these, there will be no need for reminding, as they will be clear to see throughout. Had my readers actually met Mevlut, as I have, they would agree with the women who found him boyishly handsome and know that I am not exaggerating for&nbsp;effect. In fact, let me take this opportunity to point out that there are no exaggerations anywhere in this book, which is based entirely on a true story; I will narrate some strange events that have come and gone and limit my part to ordering them in such a fashion as to allow my readers to follow and understand them more easily.<br> &nbsp;<br> So I will start in the middle, from the day in June 1982 when Mevlut eloped with a girl from the village of G�m�&#x15f;dere (linked to the Bey&#x15f;ehir district of Konya and neighboring his own village). It was at the wedding of his uncle&#x2019;s eldest son, Korkut, celebrated in Mecidiyek�y, Istanbul, in 1978, that Mevlut had first caught sight of the girl who would later agree to run away with him. He could scarcely believe that this girl, then only thirteen&#x2014;a child still&#x2014;could possibly reciprocate his feelings. She was the little sister of his cousin Korkut&#x2019;s wife, and she had never even seen Istanbul before that day. Afterward, Mevlut would write her love letters for three years. The girl never replied, but Korkut&#x2019;s younger brother&nbsp;S�leyman, who delivered Mevlut&#x2019;s letters, gave Mevlut hope and encouraged him to persevere.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, S�leyman was helping his cousin Mevlut again, this time to take the girl away. Driving his Ford van, S�leyman returned with Mevlut to the village of his childhood. The two cousins had hatched a plan to run away with the girl without being detected. According to the plan, S�leyman would wait in the van at a spot about an hour away from G�m�&#x15f;dere. Everyone would assume the two lovebirds had gone off to Bey&#x15f;ehir, but S�leyman would drive them north over the mountains and drop them off at the Ak&#x15f;ehir train station.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mevlut had gone over the plan many times in his head and twice made secret reconnaissance expeditions to crucial locations like the cold fountain, the narrow creek, the wooded hill, and the back garden of the girl&#x2019;s home. Half an hour before the appointed time, he stopped off at the village cemetery, which was on the way. He turned toward the tombstones and prayed to God for everything to go smoothly. He was loath to admit it, but he didn&#x2019;t quite trust S�leyman. What if his cousin failed to bring the van to the appointed spot near the fountain? Mevlut tried not to think about it too much; no good could come of these fears now.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was wearing the dress trousers and blue shirt he&#x2019;d bought from a&nbsp;shop in Beyo&#x11f;lu when he was back in middle school and selling yogurt with his father. His shoes were from the state-owned S�merbank factory; he&#x2019;d bought them before doing his military service.<br> &nbsp;<br> At nightfall, Mevlut approached the crumbling wall around the white house of Crooked-Necked Abdurrahman, the girl&#x2019;s father. The window at the back was dark. Mevlut was ten minutes early and anxious to get going. He thought&nbsp;of the old days when people trying to elope got entangled in blood feuds and wound up shot, or when, running away in the dead of night, they lost their way and ended up getting caught. He thought of how embarrassing it was for the boys when girls changed their minds and decided not to run away after all, and he stood up with some trepidation. He told himself that God would protect him.<br> &nbsp;<br> The dogs barked. The window lit up for a moment and then went dark again. Mevlut&#x2019;s heart began to race. He walked toward the house. He heard a rustling among the trees, and then the girl calling out to him in a whisper:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mev-lut!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a voice full of love, the voice of someone who had read the letters he&#x2019;d sent during his military service, a trusting voice. Mevlut remembered those letters now, hundreds of them, each written with genuine love and desire; he remembered how he had devoted his entire being to winning over that beautiful girl, and the scenes of happiness he&#x2019;d conjured in his mind. Now, at last, he&#x2019;d managed to get the girl. He couldn&#x2019;t see much, but in that magical night, he drew like a sleepwalker toward the sound of her voice.<br> &nbsp;<br> They found each other in the darkness. They held hands without even thinking about it and began to run. But they hadn&#x2019;t gone ten steps when the dogs started barking again, and, startled, Mevlut lost his bearings. He tried to find his way on instinct, but his head was a muddle. In the night, the trees were like walls of concrete looming in and out of view; they dodged them all as in a dream.<br> &nbsp;<br> When they reached the end of the footpath, Mevlut made for the hill ahead, as planned. At one point, the narrow, winding path through the rocks and up the hill was so steep that it seemed to reach all the way to the clouded pitch-black sky. They walked hand in hand for about&nbsp;half an hour, climbing without rest until they reached the peak. There, they could see the lights of G�m�&#x15f;dere and, farther back, the village of Cennetp&#x131;nar, where Mevlut had been born and raised. Mevlut had taken a circuitous path away from G�m�&#x15f;dere, partly to avoid leading any pursuers back to his own village, and partly on instinct, in order to thwart any treacherous scheme of S�leyman&#x2019;s.<br> &nbsp;<br> The dogs kept barking as if possessed. Mevlut realized that he was, by now, a stranger to his village, that none of the dogs recognized him anymore. Presently, he heard the sound of a gunshot coming from the direction of G�m�&#x15f;dere. They checked themselves and continued to walk at the same pace, but when the dogs, who&#x2019;d gone quiet for a moment, started barking again, they broke into a run down the hill. The leaves and branches scraped their faces, and nettles stuck to their clothes. Mevlut couldn&#x2019;t see anything in the darkness and feared that they might trip and fall over a rock at any moment, but nothing of the sort happened. He was afraid of the dogs, but he knew that God was looking out for him and&nbsp;Rayiha and that they would have a very happy life in Istanbul.<br> &nbsp;<br> They reached the road to Ak&#x15f;ehir, out of breath. Mevlut was sure they were on time. All that remained now was for S�leyman to turn up with the van, and then nobody could take Rayiha away from him. Mevlut had begun every letter invoking this girl&#x2019;s lovely face and her unforgettable eyes, inscribing her beautiful name, Rayiha, with lavish care and desperate abandon at the head of each missive. Now he was so happy at the thought of those feelings that he couldn&#x2019;t help but quicken his step.<br> &nbsp;<br> In that darkness, he could scarcely see the face of the girl he was eloping with. He thought he might at least take hold of her and kiss her, but Rayiha gently rebuffed his attempts with the bundle she was carrying. Mevlut liked that. He decided that it would be better not to touch the person he was to spend the rest of his life with until they were married.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hand in hand, they crossed the little bridge over the river Sarp. Rayiha&#x2019;s hand in his was light and delicate as a bird. A cool breeze carried the scent of thyme and bay leaves over the murmuring water.<br> &nbsp;<br> The night sky lit up with a purple hue; then came the sound of&nbsp;thunder. Mevlut worried about getting caught in the rain before the long train ride ahead, but he did not speed up his pace.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ten minutes later, they saw the taillights of S�leyman&#x2019;s van beside the gurgling fountain. Mevlut felt himself drowning in happiness. He felt bad for having doubted S�leyman. It had started raining, and they broke into a joyful run, but they were both exhausted, and the lights of the van were farther away than either of them had judged. By the time they reached the van, they were soaked through.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rayiha took her bundle and sat in the back of the van, engulfed in darkness. Mevlut and S�leyman had planned it that way, in case word got out that Rayiha had run away and the gendarmes started searching vehicles on the roads. It was also to make sure that Rayiha wouldn&#x2019;t recognize S�leyman.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once they were seated up front, Mevlut turned to his accomplice and said, &#x201c;S�leyman, as long as I live, I will be grateful for this, for your friendship and loyalty!&#x201d; He couldn&#x2019;t stop himself from embracing his cousin with all his strength.<br> &nbsp;<br> When S�leyman failed to reciprocate his enthusiasm, Mevlut blamed himself: he must have broken S�leyman&#x2019;s heart with his suspicions.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You have to swear you won&#x2019;t tell anyone that I helped you,&#x201d; said S�leyman.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mevlut swore.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She hasn&#x2019;t closed the back door properly,&#x201d; said S�leyman. Mevlut got out and walked toward the back in the darkness. As he was shutting the door on the girl, there was a flash of lightning, and for a moment, the sky, the mountains, the rocks, the trees&#x2014;everything around him&#x2014;lit up like a distant memory. For the first time, Mevlut got a proper look at the face of the woman he was to spend a lifetime with.<br> &nbsp;<br> He would remember the utter strangeness of that moment for the rest of his life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once they had started moving, S�leyman took a towel out of the glove compartment and handed it to Mevlut: &#x201c;Dry yourself.&#x201d; Mevlut sniffed at the towel to make sure it wasn&#x2019;t dirty and then passed it to the girl in the back of the van.<br> &nbsp;<br> A while later, S�leyman said to him &#x201c;You&#x2019;re still wet, and there aren&#x2019;t any other towels.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The rain peppered the roof, the windshield wipers wailed, but Mevlut knew they were crossing into a place of endless silence. The forest, dimly lit by the van&#x2019;s pale orange headlights, was thick with darkness. Mevlut had heard how wolves, jackals, and bears met with the spirits of the underworld after midnight; many times at night, on the streets of Istanbul, he had come face-to-face with the shadows of mythical creatures and demons. This was the darkness in which horn-tailed devils, big-footed giants, and horned Cyclopes roamed, looking for all the hopeless sinners and those who had lost their way, whom they would catch and take down to the underworld.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Cat got your tongue?&#x201d; S�leyman joked.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mevlut recognized that the strange silence he was entering would stay with him for years to come.<br> As he tried to work out how he had fallen into this trap life had set for him, he kept thinking, It&#x2019;s because the dogs barked and I got lost in the dark, and even though he knew his reasoning made no sense, he held fast to it, because at least it was of some comfort.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is something the matter?&#x201d; said S�leyman.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As the van slowed down to take the turns in the narrow, muddy road, and the headlights lit up the rocks, the ghostly trees, the indistinct shadows, and all the mysterious things around them, Mevlut beheld these wonders with the look of a man who knows he will never forget them for as long as he lives. They followed the tiny road, sometimes snaking up a hill, then back down again, stealing through the darkness of a village sunk in the mud. They would be met by barking dogs every time they crossed a village, only to be plunged once again into a silence so deep that Mevlut wasn&#x2019;t sure whether the strangeness was in his mind or in the world. In the darkness, he saw the shadows of mythical birds. He saw words written in incomprehensible scripts, and the ruins of the demon armies that had traversed these remote lands hundreds of years ago. He saw the shadows of people who had been turned to stone for their sins.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No regrets, right?&#x201d; said S�leyman. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to be afraid of. I doubt anyone is following us. I&#x2019;m sure they all knew the girl was going to run away, except maybe her crooked-necked father, and he&#x2019;ll be easy to deal with. You&#x2019;ll see, they&#x2019;ll all come around in a month or two, and then before the summer&#x2019;s over, you two can come back to get everyone&#x2019;s blessing. Just don&#x2019;t tell anyone I helped you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As they turned a sharp corner on a steep incline, the van&#x2019;s back tires got stuck in the mud. For a moment, Mevlut imagined that it could all be over, that Rayiha would go back to her village and he would go back to his home in Istanbul, without any further trouble.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then the van started moving again.<br> &nbsp;<br> An hour later, one or two lonely buildings and the narrow lanes of the town of Ak&#x15f;ehir appeared in the headlights. The train station was on the outskirts, at the other side of town.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Whatever happens, don&#x2019;t get separated,&#x201d; said S�leyman as he dropped them off at Ak&#x15f;ehir railway station. He glanced back at the girl waiting with her bundle in the darkness. &#x201c;I shouldn&#x2019;t get out, I don&#x2019;t want her to recognize me. I&#x2019;ve got a hand in this, too, now. You must make Rayiha happy, Mevlut, got it? She&#x2019;s your wife now; the die is cast. You should lie low for a while when you get to Istanbul.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mevlut and Rayiha watched as S�leyman drove away until they could no longer see the van&#x2019;s red taillights. They walked into the old train station building without holding hands.<br> &nbsp;<br> Inside the brightly lit train station, gleaming under fluorescent lights, Mevlut looked once again at the face of the girl he had run away with, a closer look this time, enough to confirm what he had glimpsed but not quite believed while shutting the back door of the van; he looked away.<br> &nbsp;<br> This was not the girl he had seen at the wedding of his uncle&#x2019;s elder son Korkut in Istanbul. This was her older sister. They had shown him the pretty sister at the wedding, and then given him the ugly sister instead. Mevlut realized he&#x2019;d been tricked. He was ashamed and couldn&#x2019;t even look at the girl whose name may well not have been Rayiha.<br> &nbsp;<br> Who had played this trick on him, and how? Walking toward the&nbsp;ticket counter at the train station, he heard the distant echoes of his own footsteps as if they belonged to someone else. For the rest of his life, old train stations would always remind Mevlut of these moments.</p><h2>The Cartel 4: Diamonds are Forever</h2><p>You thought The Cartel was over, but Diamonds are forever. . . .<br><br>The Diamond family has survived murder, deceit, and betrayal.

Politically, England was emerging as a modern state, struggling with its new autonomy and experimenting with representative government. Religiously, the Puritan voices of the radical Reformation battled with the established church to move it from the via media. Intellectually, it was an age in which new philosophical voices were emerging and bards were composing their odes not in the learned classical languages of antiquity but in English. Taylor saw the completion of the Authorized Version of King James near the beginning of his life: an eloquent precursor of the monumental achievements that men like Donne, Milton, and Bunyan would make during his lifetime. <p>Taylor has been called the "Shakespeare of the Divines." Like his older contemporary Lancelot Andrewes, he drew on the spirit of the Renaissance. Rich classical allusions, ornate symbolism, and flowing cadences enhance his presentation of the sacred truths of holy writ. His own experience of life made him no stranger to suffering, having buried his first wife and all of his five sons. In his best-known work, Holy Dying, we have not only a fine example of a genre of spiritual literature common to the late Middle Ages, but one of the moving meditations on death ever written. In it we see a man proclaiming the truths of Christianity, not with the bold speculative originality of mystics like Eckhart or the systematic precision of Albert the Great, but with a sheer literary brilliance that enabled him to craft words that stood like windows to the unseen world of which they spoke: words that could awaken and stir, that could define and articulate the myriad sentiments and subtleties of the holy life. </p><p>In this volume the whole range of Taylor's achievement is surveyed. His work as a pilgrim and pastor, theologian and priest, poet and preacher is presented with comprehensive introductions that highlight how he blended the insights of the Fathers with the forces of his own time into brilliant new forms of expressions.</p></p><p>JOHN E.

He lives in Seattle.1 <br>Mr. Blingham, and may he fry in his own cooking-oil, was assistant treasurer of the Flaver-Saver Company. He was driving from New York to Winnipeg, accompanied by Mrs. Blingham and their horrible daughter. As they were New Yorkers, only a business trip could have dragged them into this wilderness, and they found everything west of Pennsylvania contemptible. They laughed at Chicago for daring to have skyscrapers and at Madison for pretending to have a university, and they stopped the car and shrieked when they entered Minnesota and saw a billboard advertising &#x201c;Ten Thousand Lakes.&#x201d;<br><br>Miss Blingham, whom they called &#x201c;Sister,&#x201d; commented, &#x201c;Unless you had a New York sense of humor, you would never be able to understand why that sign is so funny!&#x201d;<br><br>When they came to their first prairie hamlet in Minnesota, six cottages, a garage, a store and a tall red grain elevator, Mrs. Blingham giggled, &#x201c;Why, they&#x2019;ve got an Empire State Building here!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And all the Svensons and Bensons and Hensons go up to the Rainbow Room every evening!&#x201d; gurgled Sister.<br><br>Their laughter buoyed them for a hundred miles, till it was time to think of lunch. Mrs. Blingham looked at the map. &#x201c;Grand Republic, Minnesota. That seems to be about forty miles from here, and it&#x2019;s quite a village&#x2014;85,000 people.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s try it. They ought to have some sort of a hotel to eat at,&#x201d; yawned Mr. Blingham.<br><br>&#x201c;All the best people there eat at the Salvation Army Shelter!&#x201d; yelped Mrs. Blingham.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you slay me!&#x201d; said Sister.<br><br>When, from the bluffs of the Sorshay River, they looked down to the limestone shaft of the Blue Ox National Bank Building and the welter of steel and glass sheds that had been erected for the Wargate Wood Products Corporation since 1941, Mr. Blingham said, &#x201c;Fair-sized war plant they got there.&#x201d;<br><br>Since the beginning of World War II, Grand Republic had grown from 85,000 to 90,000. To some ninety thousand immortal souls, it was the center of the universe, and all distances were to be measured from it; Moscow was defined as a place 6,100 miles from Home, and Saudi Arabia as a market for Wargate wallboard and huts and propellers. The Blinghams, who knew that the true center of the solar system is the corner of Fifth Avenue and Fifty-seventh Street, would have been irritated to find out how many of the simpletons in the valley below them believed that New York contained nothing but hotels, burlesque shows, a ghetto and Wall Street.<br><br>Mrs. Blingham urged, &#x201c;Come on. We can&#x2019;t waste all day looking at this dump. The hotel-guide gives the Pineland as the best place for chow. Let&#x2019;s try it.&#x201d;<br><br>They did not notice them, but on the way to the Pineland they must have passed scrollwork palaces of 1880, an Italian Catholic Church, a pawn-shop in which a Lithuanian lumberjack had recently pawned the L�ger pistol with which he had murdered a Siamese mining-camp cook, the best women&#x2019;s dress-shop between Fort William and Dallas, a Victoria Cross aviator, and a Negro clergyman who was a Doctor of Philosophy.<br><br>In front of the tapestry-brick, nine-storied Hotel Pineland (designed by Lefleur, O&#x2019;Flaherty, and Zipf of Minneapolis), Mr. Blingham said doubtfully, &#x201c;Well, I suppose we can get some kind of grub here.&#x201d;<br><br>They thought it very funny that the more choosy of the two restaurants in the Pineland should presumptuously be named &#x201c;The Fiesole Room,&#x201d; though they would not have found it funny if they had known that locally it was pronounced &#x201c;Feesoly,&#x201d; because that was how the Blinghams pronounced it, also,<br><br>The Fiesole Room had, for cinquecento atmosphere, Pompeian-red walls, majolica dishes, a Spanish wine-jar on either side of the doorway, and a frieze of antique Grecian runners done by a local portrait-painter.<br><br>&#x201c;My, my, don&#x2019;t they put on the dog in &#x2014; what&#x2019;s the name of this town again?&#x201d; mocked Sister.<br><br>&#x201c;Grand Rapids,&#x201d; said Mr. Blingham.<br><br>&#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s the furniture, where Aunt Ella comes from. This,&#x201d; said Mrs. Blingham authoritatively, after looking at the map, &#x201c;is Grand Republic.<br><br>&#x201c;What a silly name!&#x201d; pronounced Sister. &#x201c;Sounds like Fourthajuly. Oh, God, these hicks!&#x201d;<br><br>They were elaborately escorted to a table by the headwaiter, a dignified, erect colored man whose head resembled a brown billiard ball. They did not know that he was Drexel Greenshaw, the leader of the conservative wing of the Negro Community. He looked like a bishop, like a general, like a senator, any of whom he might have been if he had chosen another calling than table-waiting and another color.<br><br>Mr. Blingham had the Hungarian goulash. Mrs. Blingham was bold in the matter of roast lamb. Sister took the chicken salad, snapping at the colored waiter, &#x201c;And do try to have a little chicken in it, will yuh?&#x201d;<br><br>They found it highly comic that the waiter bowed, and said, &#x201c;Yes, Miss.&#x201d; They could not have explained why they found it comic. As they said, &#x201c;You have to be a New Yorker to understand our Sense of Humor. A nigger hash-hustler in a dump like this making like he was at the Ritz!&#x201d;<br><br>It is true that in New York, on their evenings of festival, they did not dine at the Ritz but at a Schrafft&#x2019;s.<br><br>Toying delicately with her chicken salad, but finishing all of it as well as all the rolls, Sister looked cynically about the Fiesole Room.<br><br>&#x201c;Mm, mm! Respected parents, will you look at the table to my right? Please buy him for me&#x2014;the young one.&#x201d;<br><br>The person whom she had thus favored was an amiable man of thirty with solid shoulders and freckled paws and the clear skin that often goes with red hair like his. You thought of football, later tempered by tennis. But what you most noticed was the singular innocence of his blue eyes and the innocence and enthusiasm of his smile.<br><br>&#x201c;He looks like a Scotch army officer,&#x201d; approved Sister. &#x201c;He ought to be wearing kilts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sister! And he looks to me like a shoe-clerk,&#x201d; sniffed Mrs. Blingham.<br><br>With that, they forgot the young man, who was neither a shoe-clerk nor more than a quarter Scotch. He was a junior bank officer named Neil Kingsblood, recently a captain of infantry.<br><br>On their way north, after lunch, the Blinghams got off their proper route. They were too proud to ask questions of the barbaric natives, and they circled through the expensive residence district of Ottawa Heights and a new, gray-shingle and stucco and asphalt-roof and picture-window real-estate development called Sylvan Park. As they turned from Linden Lane upon Balsam Trail, they did not note a &#x201c;colonial cottage,&#x201d; new and neat and painty, with broad white clapboards and blue shutters, on the northwest corner; nor did they look at the brisk and handsome young woman and the four-year-old girl, all pink and pale gold, who were coming out of the cottage. Yet this was the house of Captain Neil Kingsblood, and these were his wife, Vestal, and Biddy, his lively daughter.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess we&#x2019;ll have to ask the way. Do you s&#x2019;pose the folks out here speak English?&#x201d; said Mrs. Blingham irritably.<br><br>That evening, as they were approaching Crookston, where they were to spend the night, Mr. Blingham mused, &#x201c;What was the name of that burg where we had lunch today &#x2014; where we got lost, leaving town?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Funny, I can&#x2019;t remember it,&#x201d; said Mrs. Blingham. &#x201c;Big River or something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where the good-looking young man was,&#x201d; said Sister.</p><h2>Corpus: A gripping spy thriller</h2><p><b>A gripping spy thriller for fans of ROBERT HARRIS and WILLIAM BOYD from award-winning<i> Sunday Times </i>bestseller Rory Clements and author of the 2018 CWA HISTORICAL DAGGER WINNER, <i>NUCLEUS</i></b><br><br><b>1936.

Most importantly, he accounts for what Victorians called the &#39;races&#39; of mankind by means of what he calls sexual selection. This book presents a full explanation of Darwin&#39;s ideas about sexual selection, including his belief that many important characteristics of human beings and animals have emerged in response to competition for mates. This was a controversial work. Yet Darwin tried hard to avoid being branded as a radical revolutionary. He is steeped in Victorian sensibilities regarding gender and cultural differences: he sees human civilization as a move from barbarous savagery to modern gentlefolk, and women as more emotional and less intellectual than men, thus providing a biological basis for the social assumptions and prejudices of the day. The Descent of Man played a major role in the emergence of social Darwinism. This complete version of the first edition gives the modern reader an unparalleled opportunity to engage directly with Darwin&#39;s proposals, launched in the midst of continuing controversy over On the Origin of Species. Janet Browne is the author of the prize-winning biography, Charles Darwin: Voyaging and Charles Darwin: The Power of Place.</p><p>Charles Darwin was an English naturalist and author best-known for his revolutionary theories on the origin of species, human evolution, and natural selection. A life-long interest in the natural world led Darwin to neglect his medical studies and instead embark on a five-year scientific voyage on the HMS Beagle, where he established his reputation as a geologist and gathered much of the evidence that fuelled his later theories.A prolific writer, Darwin s most famous published works include The Voyage of the Beagle, On the Origin of Species, The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, and The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals. Darwin died in 1882, and in recognition of his contributions to science, is buried in Westminster Abbey along with John Herschel and Isaac Newton.</p><h2>Beginning Operations: A Sector General Omnibus: Hospital Station, Star Surgeon, Major Operation</h2><p><p>Sector General: A massive deep-space hospital station on the Galactic Rim, where human and alien medicine meet. Its 384 levels and thousands of staff members are supposedly able to meet the needs of any conceivable alien patient--though that capacity is always being strained as more (and stranger) alien races turn up to join the galactic community. Sentient viruses, interspecies romances, undreamed-of institutional catering problems--it all lands on Sector General's doorstep. And the only thing weirder than a hitherto unknown alien species is having a member of that species turn up in your Emergency Room.</p><p>The first of two omnibus volumes reprints the works that began the Sector General series, which were previously published as <i>Hospital Station </i>(1962), <i>Star Surgeon</i> (1963), and <i>Major Operation</i> (1971).</p></p><p><p><b>James White</b> lived in Northern Ireland.

Coming as it did from Hudlar, a four-G world with an atmospheric pressure nearly seven times Earth normal, such ruggedness of physique was to be expected. But despite its enormous strength the being was helpless, O'Mara knew, because it was barely six months old, it had just seen its parents die in a construction accident, and its brain was sufficiently well developed for the sight to have frightened it badly. <br>"I've b-b-brought the kid," said Waring, one of the section's tractor-beam operators. He hated O'Mara, and with good reason, but he was trying not to gloat. "C-C-Caxton sent me. He says your leg makes you unfit for normal duty, so you can look after the young one until somebody arrives from its home planet. He's on his way over n-now&#x2026;" <br>Waring trailed off. He began checking the seals of his spacesuit, obviously in a hurry to get out before O'Mara could mention the accident. "I brought some of its food with me," he ended quickly. "It's in the airlock." <br>O'Mara nodded without speaking. He was a young man cursed with the kind of physique which ensured him winning every fight he had ever been in, and there had been a great many of them recently, and a face which was as square, heavy and roughly formed as was his over-muscled body. He knew that if he allowed himself to show how much that accident had affected him, Waring would think that he was simply putting on an act. Men who were put together as he was, O'Mara had long ago discovered, were not supposed to have any of the softer emotions. <br>* * * <br>Immediately Waring departed he went to the airlock for the glorified paint-sprayer with which Hudlarians away from their home planet were fed. While checking the gadget and its spare food tanks he tried to go over the story he would have to tell Caxton when the section chief arrived. Staring moodily through the airlock port at the bits and pieces of the gigantic jigsaw puzzle spread across fifty cubic miles of space outside, he tried to think. But his mind kept ducking away from the accident and slipping instead into generalities and events which were in the far past or future. <br>The vast structure which was slowly taking shape in Galactic Sector Twelve, midway between the rim of the parent galaxy and the densely populated systems of the Greater Magellanic Cloud, was to be a hospital--a hospital to end all hospitals. Hundreds of different environments would be accurately reproduced here, any extreme of heat, cold, pressure, gravity, radiation or atmosphere necessary for the patients and staff it would contain. Such a tremendous and complex structure was far beyond the resources of any one planet, so that hundreds of worlds had each fabricated sections of it and transported them to the assembly point. <br>But fitting the jigsaw together was no easy job. <br>Each of the worlds concerned had their copies of the master plan. But errors occurred despite this--probably through the plan having to be translated into so many different languages and systems of measurement. Sections which should have fitted snugly together very often had to be modified to make them join properly, and this necessitated moving the sections together and apart several times with massed tractor and pressor beams. This was very tricky work for the beam operators, because while the weight of the sections out in space was nil, their mass and inertia was tremendous. <br>And anyone unlucky enough to be caught between the joining faces of two sections in the process of being fitted became, no matter how tough a life-form they happened to be, an almost perfect representation of a two-dimensional body. <br>* * * <br>The beings who had died belonged to a tough species, physiological classification FROB to be exact. Adult Hudlarians weighed in the region of two Earth tons, possessed an incredibly hard but flexible tegument which, as well as protecting them from their own native and external pressures, allowed them to live and work comfortably in any atmosphere of lesser pressure down to and including the vacuum of space. In addition they had the highest radiation tolerance level known, which made them particularly invaluable during power pile assembly. <br>The loss of two such valuable beings from his section would, in any case, have made Caxton mad, quite apart from other considerations. O'Mara sighed heavily, decided that his nervous system demanded a more positive release than that, and swore. Then he picked up the feeder and returned to the bedroom. <br>Normally the Hudlarians absorbed food directly through their skin from the thick, soupy atmosphere of their planet, but on any other world or in space a concentrated food compound had to be sprayed onto the absorbent hides at certain intervals. The young e-t was showing large bare patches and in other places the previous food coating had worn very thin. Definitely, thought O'Mara, the infant was due for another feed. He moved as close as seemed safe and began to spray carefully. <br>The process of being painted with food seemed to be a pleasant one for the young FROB. It ceased to cower in the corner and began blundering excitedly about the small bedroom. For O'Mara it became a matter of trying to hit a rapidly moving object while practicing violent evasive maneuvers himself, which set his injured leg throbbing more painfully than ever. His furniture suffered, too. <br>Practically the whole interior surface of his sleeping compartment was covered with the sticky, sharp-smelling food compound, and also the exterior of the now-quiescent young alien, when Caxton arrived. <br>"What's going on?" said the Section Chief. <br>Space construction men as a class were simple, uncomplicated personalities whose reactions were easily predictable. Caxton was the type who always asked what was going on even when, as now, he knew--and especially when such unnecessary questions were meant simply to needle somebody. In the proper circumstances the section chief was probably a quite likeable individual, O'Mara thought, but between Caxton and himself those circumstances had yet to come about. <br>O'Mara answered the question without showing the anger he felt, and ended, "&#x2026;After this I think I'll keep the kid in space, and feed it there&#x2026;" <br>"You will not!" Caxton snapped. "You'll keep it here with you, all the time. But more about that later. At the moment I want to know about the accident. Your side of it, that is." <br>His expression said that he was prepared to listen, but that he already doubted every word that O'Mara would say in advance. <br>* * * <br>"Before you go any further," Caxton broke in after O'Mara had completed two sentences, "you know that this project is under Monitor Corps jurisdiction. Usually the Monitors let us settle any trouble that crops up in our own way, but this case involves extra-terrestrials and they'll have to be brought in on it. There'll be an investigation." He tapped the small, flat box hanging from his chest. "It's only fair to warn you that I'm taping everything you say." <br>O'Mara nodded and began giving his account of the accident in a low monotone. It was a very weak story, he knew, and stressing any particular incident so as to point it up in his favor would make it sound even more artificial. Several times Caxton opened his mouth to speak, but thought better of it. Finally he said: <br>"But did anyone <i>see</i> you doing these things? Or even see the two e-ts moving about in the danger area while the warning lights were burning? You have a neat little story to explain this madness on their part--which, incidentally, makes you quite a hero--but it could be that you switched on the lights <i>after</i> the accident, that it was your negligence regarding the lights which caused it, and that all this about the straying youngster is a pack of lies designed to get you out of a very serious charge--" <br>"Waring saw me," O'Mara cut in. <br>Caxton stared at him intently, his expression changing from suppressed anger to one of utter disgust and scorn. Despite himself O'Mara felt his face heating up. <br>"Waring eh?" said the section chief tonelessly. "A nice touch, that. You know, and we all know, that you have been riding Waring constantly, needling him and playing on his disability to such an extent that he must hate you like poison. Even if he did see you, the court would expect him to keep quiet about it. And if he did not see you, they would think that he had and was keeping quiet about it anyway. O'Mara, you make me sick." <br>Caxton wheeled and stamped toward the airlock. With one foot through the inner seal he turned again. <br>"You're nothing but a troublemaker, O'Mara," he said angrily, "a surly, quarrelsome lump of bone and muscle with just enough skill to make you worth keeping. You may think that it was technical ability which got you these quarters on your own. It wasn't, you're good but not that good! The truth is that nobody else in my section would share accommodation with you&#x2026;" <br>The section chief's hand moved to the cut-off switch on his recorder. His voice, as he ended, became a quiet, deadly thing. <br>"&#x2026;And O'Mara if you let any harm come to that youngster, if anything happens to it at all, the Monitors won't even get the chance to try you." <br>The implications behind those final words were clear, O'Mara thought angrily as the section chief left; he was sentenced to live with this organic half-ton tank for a period that would feel like eternity no matter how short it was. Everybody knew that exposing Hudlarians to space was like putting a dog out for the night--there were no harmful effects at all. But what some people knew and what they felt were two vastly different things and O'Mara was dealing here with the personalities of simple, uncomplicated, over-sentimental and very angry construction men. <br>* * * <br>When he had joined the project six months before, O'Mara found that he was doomed again to the performance of a job which, while important in i...</p><h2>Black Widow (12) (Elemental Assassin)</h2><p>Lethal, sexy, and always ready to protect her friends, Gin Blanco (a.k.a. the Spider) takes on the mysterious M.M.

Next to her, a city official sporting a brown plaid jacket and a gray handlebar mustache droned on and on and on about all the good things that her mother, Mab Monroe, had done for Ashland.<br> <br>Please. The only good thing Mab had ever done in her entire life was die. Something that I&#x2019;d been all too happy to help her with.<br> <br>Then again, that&#x2019;s what assassins did, and I was the Spider, one of the best.<br> <br>Madeline&#x2019;s crimson lips quirked, revealing a hint of her dazzling white teeth, as though she found the same irony in the speaker&#x2019;s words that I did. She knew precisely what a sadistic bitch her mother had been, especially since she was cut from the exact same bloodstained cloth.<br> <br>Still, even I had to admit that Madeline made an angelic figure, standing there so calmly, so serenely, in her tailored white pantsuit, as though she was truly enjoying listening to all of the prattle about Mab&#x2019;s supposed charitable works. It was high noon, and the bright sun brought out the coppery streaks in Madeline&#x2019;s thick auburn hair, making it seem as if her long, flowing locks were strings of glowing embers about to burst into flames. But Madeline didn&#x2019;t have her mama&#x2019;s famed elemental Fire power. She had something much rarer and far more dangerous: acid magic.<br> <br>Madeline shifted on her white stilettos, making the sun shimmer on the silverstone necklace circling her throat&#x2014;a crown with a flame-shaped emerald set in the center of it. A ring on her right hand featured the same design. Madeline&#x2019;s personal rune, the symbol for raw, destructive power, eerily similar to the ruby sunburst necklace that Mab had worn before I&#x2019;d destroyed it&#x2014;and her.<br> <br>Just staring at Madeline&#x2019;s rune was enough to make my hands curl into fists, my fingers digging into the scars embedded deep in my palms&#x2014;each a small circle surrounded by eight thin rays. A spider rune, the symbol for patience.<br> <br>Mab had given me the scars years ago, when she&#x2019;d melted my spider rune necklace into my palms, forever marking me. I just wondered how many more scars her daughter would add to my collection before our family feud was settled.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d say that she looks like the cat who ate the canary, but we both know that she&#x2019;d just use her acid magic to obliterate the poor thing.&#x201d; The suave, drawling voice somehow made the words that much snarkier.<br> <br>I looked to my right at the man who was leaning against the maple tree that shaded us both, his shoulders relaxed, his hands stuffed in his pants pockets, his long legs crossed at the ankles. His hair was a dark walnut, blending into the trunk of the tree behind him, but amusement glinted in his green eyes, making them stand out despite the dappled shadows that danced over his handsome face. His ash-gray Fiona Fine suit draped perfectly over his muscular figure, giving him a casual elegance that was the complete opposite of my tense, rigid, watchful stance. Then again, Finnegan Lane, my foster brother, always looked as cool as an ice-cream sundae, whether he was out for a seemingly simple stroll in the park, wheeling and dealing as an investment banker, or peering through a sniper&#x2019;s scope, ready to put a bullet through someone&#x2019;s skull.<br> <br>Finn arched an eyebrow at me. &#x201c;Well, Gin? What do you say?&#x201d;<br> <br>I snorted. &#x201c;Oh, Madeline wouldn&#x2019;t use her acid magic herself. She&#x2019;d manipulate someone else into killing the bird and the cat for her&#x2014;and have the poor fool convinced that it had been his idea all the while.&#x201d;<br> <br>He let out a low chuckle. &#x201c;Well, you have to admire that about her.&#x201d;<br> <br>I snorted again. &#x201c;That she&#x2019;s a master manipulator who likes to make people dance to the strings that she so gleefully wraps around them before they even realize what&#x2019;s happening? Please. The only thing I admire about her is that she&#x2019;s managed to keep a mostly straight face through this entire farce of a dedication.&#x201d;<br> <br>Finn and I were standing at the back of a crowd that had gathered in a park in Northtown, the rich, fancy, highfalutin part of Ashland that was home to the wealthy, powerful, and extremely dangerous. The park was exactly what you&#x2019;d expect to find in this part of Northtown: lots of perfectly landscaped lawns and towering trees with thick tangles of branches, along with an enormous playground that featured seesaws, swing sets, a sandbox, and a merry-go-round. It was a picturesque scene, especially given the beautiful blue-sky October afternoon and the rich, deep, earthy scent of autumn that swirled through the air on the faint breeze. But the pleasantly warm temperature and cheery rays streaming through the burnt-orange leaves over my head did absolutely nothing to improve my mood.<br> <br>At my harsh words, a couple of people turned to give me annoyed looks, but a cold glare from me had them easing away and facing the podium again.<br> <br>Finn let out another low chuckle. &#x201c;You and your people skills never cease to amaze me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201d; I muttered.<br> <br>As the speaker droned on, my wintry gray gaze swept over the park, and I thought about the last time I&#x2019;d been here&#x2014;and the men I&#x2019;d killed. A vampire and a couple of giants, some of Mab&#x2019;s minions, who were torturing and about to murder an innocent bartender before I&#x2019;d intervened. The swing sets, the merry-go-round, one of the lawns. Men had died all over this park, and I&#x2019;d even drawn my rune in the sandbox in a dare to Mab to come find me, the Spider, the elusive assassin who was causing her such consternation.<br> <br>And now here I was again, months later, confronted with the next Monroe who wanted to do me in.<br> <br>Sometimes I wondered if I could ever really escape the past and all the consequences of it. Mab murdering my mother and my older sister, then trying to kill me and my younger sister, Bria, leaving me alone, injured, and homeless. Fletcher Lane, Finn&#x2019;s dad, taking me in and training me to be an assassin. My finally killing Mab earlier this year. All the underworld bosses who&#x2019;d been trying to murder me ever since then.<br> <br>The city official finally wrapped up his tediously long speech and gestured at Madeline. She stepped forward, reached up, and took hold of a black rope attached to an enormous white cloth that had been draped over the wrought-iron gate that arched over the park entrance. Madeline smiled at the crowd, pausing a moment for dramatic effect, before she yanked on the rope, ripping away the cloth, while giving an elaborate flourish with her free hand.<br> <br>Fancy, curlicued letters spelled out the new name in the black metal arch: Monroe Memorial Park.<br> <br>I glared up at the sign, wishing I had one of the blacksmith hammers that my lover, Owen Grayson, used in his forge, so I could kneecap the gate, send it crashing to the ground, and then knock out each and every one of those damn letters in the toothy smile of the arch. Especially the ones in Monroe. But, of course, I couldn&#x2019;t do that. Not now. Maybe late tonight, when the park was nice and deserted, and no one was around to see me vent my pent-up rage on an innocent sign.<br> <br>This wasn&#x2019;t the first dedication I&#x2019;d attended in the past few weeks. After finally making her grand appearance in Ashland back in September, Madeline had wasted no time in claiming her millions in inheritance as M.M. Monroe, moving into Mab&#x2019;s mansion, and letting everyone know that she intended to pick up all of her mother&#x2019;s business interests, legitimate and otherwise.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know exactly what her master plan was, but Madeline had set about ingratiating herself with all sorts of civic, charitable, and municipal groups, saying she wanted to continue all of the good works her mother had funded while she was alive. Of course, she was lying through her perfect teeth, since Madeline was no more charitable than her mama had been. But if there was one thing that folks in Ashland responded to, it was cold, hard cash&#x2014;or at least the promise of it.<br> <br>And so the dedications had begun. A wing at the Briartop art museum, the train station, several bridges, a good chunk of the interstate that wrapped around the downtown loop, and now this park. Every few days, it seemed like someone was engraving, chiseling, painting, broadcasting, or proclaiming something else in Mab&#x2019;s name at dear, dutiful daughter Madeline&#x2019;s teary and oh-so-grateful requests.<br> <br>And I&#x2019;d been to every single breakfast, luncheon, dinner, tea party, cocktail hour, coffee klatch, barbecue, and fish fry, trying to figure out what my new enemy was up to. But Madeline was an excellent actress; all she did was grin and make small talk and preen for the cameras. Every once in a while, I would catch her staring at me, a small smile playing across her lips, as though my obvious stakeouts were amusing her. Well, that made one of us.<br> <br>Of course, I had Finn digging into Madeline, trying to find out everything he could about her past, her personal life, and her finances, in hopes of finding a clue to what she was planning for me and the rest of the Ashland underworld. But so far, Finn hadn&#x2019;t been able to find anything out of the ordinary. Neither had Silvio Sanchez, my new self-proclaimed personal assistant.<br> <br>She had no criminal history. No massive debt load. No large cash withdrawals from her bank accounts. No sudden, hostile takeovers of any businesses&#x2014;legal or otherwise&#x2014;that Mab had once owned. And perhaps most telling of all, no late-night, hush-hush meetings with the underworld bosses.<br> <br>Yet.<br> <br>Still, I knew that Madeline had some sort of scheme in mind for me. Impending evil always made my spider rune scars itch in warning&#x2014;and anticipation of turning the tables on my enemies.<br> <br>Usually, Madeline ignored me at the dedications, but apparently, she wanted to chitchat today, because she shook hands with the official, then strolled in my direction. And she wasn&#x2019;t alone.<br> <br>Two people followed her. One was a giant bodyguard dressed in a white silk shirt and a black pantsuit, around seven feet tall, with light hazel eyes and a sleek bob of golden hair that curled under at the ends. The sun had reddened her milky cheeks, giving her skin a bit of hot, ruddy color and darkening the faint freckles that dotted her face. The other was a much shorter man, clutching a silverstone briefcase in front of him and dressed in a light gray suit that was even slicker and more expensive than Finn&#x2019;s. A lion&#x2019;s mane of hair wrapped around his head, the arches, dips, and waves as pretty and perfect as icing decorating a cake. His elegant silver coif hinted at his sixty-something age, despite the tight, tan, unlined skin of his face.<br> <br>Emery Slater and Jonah McAllister. Emery was the niece of Elliot Slater, who&#x2019;d been Mab&#x2019;s number one giant enforcer before I&#x2019;d taken credit for killing him, while Jonah had been Mab&#x2019;s personal lawyer and someone whose many crimes I&#x2019;d taken great pleasure in exposing back during the summer. Needless to say, there was plenty of hate to go around among the three of us.<br> <br>&#x201c;Incoming,&#x201d; Finn murmured, straightening up, pushing away from the tree, and moving to stand beside me.<br> <br>Madeline stopped in front of me, with Emery and Jonah flanking her. The giant and the lawyer both shot me icy glares, but Madeline&#x2019;s features were warm and welcoming as she sidled a little closer to me, and a serene smile stretched across her face.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why, Gin Blanco,&#x201d; she purred. &#x201c;How good of you to come out to my dedication today. And looking so . . . spiffy.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wore what I always wore: black boots, dark jeans, and a long-sleeved black T-shirt. Next to Madeline and her crisp white suit, I resembled one of the hoboes who sometimes slept in this park. Madeline might seem all sweetness and light on the outside, but on the inside, I knew that her heart was as full of venom and as vicious as mine.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why, Madeline,&#x201d; I drawled right back at her, &#x201c;you know that I wouldn&#x2019;t have missed it for the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;You do seem rather fond of popping up everywhere I go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you can hardly blame me for that. It&#x2019;s always so very lovely to see someone of Mab&#x2019;s stature honored in such small but touching ways.&#x201d;<br> <br>Madeline&#x2019;s lips quirked again, as if she was having trouble holding back her laughter at my blatant lie. Yeah. Me too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Funny thing, though,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You know was I&#x2019;ve noticed? That Mab&#x2019;s name isn&#x2019;t actually on anything. It&#x2019;s always just &#x2018;Monroe Memorial this&#x2019; and &#x2018;Monroe Memorial that.&#x2019; Why, if I didn&#x2019;t know better, I&#x2019;d almost think that you were going around town putting your name on everything. Instead of your dearly departed mama&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>Finn chuckled. Emery and Jonah shifted their cold stares to him, but Finn kept laughing, completely immune to their dirty looks. He was rather incorrigible that way.<br> <br>Madeline&#x2019;s green eyes crinkled a bit at the corners, as if she was having to work to maintain her sunny smile. &#x201c;I think that you&#x2019;re mistaken, Gin. I&#x2019;m honoring my mother exactly the way that she would have wanted me to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And I think that you have as little love for your dead mama as I do. You couldn&#x2019;t care less about what she would have wanted.&#x201d;<br> <br>Anger flashed in Madeline&#x2019;s eyes, making them flare an even brighter, more vibrant green, the same intense, wicked color as the acid that she could summon with just a wave of her French-manicured hand. She didn&#x2019;t like me calling her out on her true feelings for her mother, and she especially didn&#x2019;t like that I&#x2019;d pointed out that the dedications were all about her ego, not Mab.<br> <br>Good. I wanted to make her angry. I wanted to piss her off. I wanted to rile her up so much that she couldn&#x2019;t even see straight, much less think straight, especially when it came to me. Because that&#x2019;s when she would make a mistake, and I could finally figure out what her endgame was and how I could stop it before she destroyed everything and everyone I cared about.<br> <br>&#x201c;But who am I to judge?&#x201d; I drawled on. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t care either, not if she had been my mother. I guess it&#x2019;s one of those little things that we&#x2019;ll just have to agree to disagree on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Madeline blinked, and she forced her crimson lips to lift a little higher. &#x201c;You know, I think that you&#x2019;re right. We are just destined to agree to disagree&#x2014;about a great many things.&#x201d;<br> <br>We stared each other down, our stances casual and our features perfectly pleasant but with a deadly, dangerous coldness lurking just below the smooth surfaces.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyway, I&#x2019;m afraid I must be going,&#x201d; Madeline said, breaking the silence. &#x201c;I have another dedication to prepare for tomorrow. This one&#x2019;s at the library downtown.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there with bells on.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said in a pleased voice. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you will. But I do thank you for coming out here today, Gin. As you said, it&#x2019;s always so very lovely to see you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Madeline smirked at me, then pivoted on her stiletto and moved back toward the podium, shaking hands and thanking all for their support and well wishes. Emery and Jonah each gave me one more hostile glare before they trailed after her. Soon the three of them were in the heart of the crowd, with Finn and me standing by ourselves underneath the maple.<br> <br>&#x201c;She really is something,&#x201d; ...</p><h2>Into the Universe of Technical Images (Electronic Mediations)</h2><p>Poised between hope and despair for a humanity facing an urgent communication crisis, this work by Vil�m Flusser forecasts either the first truly human, infinitely creative society in history or a society of unbearable, oppressive sameness, locked in a pattern it cannot change. First published in German in 1985 and now available in English for the first time, <i>Into the Universe of Technical</i> Images outlines the history of communication technology as a process of increasing abstraction. <br>Flusser charts how communication evolved from direct interaction with the world to mediation through various technologies. The invention of writing marked one significant shift; the invention of photography marked another, heralding the current age of the technical image. The automation of the processing of technical images carries both promise and threat: the promise of freeing humans to play and invent and the threat for networks of automation to proceed independently of humans.</p><p>Vil�m Flusser (1920&#x2013;1991) was born in Prague; emigrated to Brazil, where he taught philosophy and wrote a daily newspaper colum; and later moved to France. Among his many books that have been translated into English are <i>The Shape of Things</i>, <i>Towards a Philosophy of Photography</i>, <i>The Freedom of the Migrant</i>, and <i>Writings</i> (Minnesota, 2004). Nancy Ann Roth is an arts writer and critic based in the United Kingdom.

You will learn how edging patterns can be used to create entire fabrics, reformatted to make individual decorative motifs, reverse-engineered from existing fabrics, and even used to create three-dimensional designs. Focusing on construction techniques for edgings, <i>The Finer Edge</i> is divided into separate sections based on top-down, sideways, and bottom-up methods to help guide the reader.</p><p>Though there are 12 project patterns that highlight the edgings, you'll be inspired to creatively mix and match within each edging's section. Also included in this gorgeous book are charts, illustrations, and photographs of crochet swatches and a pattern collection that includes multiple sizes, including plus sizes.</p><p>Discover innovation at its finest with <i>The Finer Edge</i>.</p></p><p><p><b>Kristin Omdahl</b> is the author of <i>Crochet So Fine</i> (Interweave, 2010), <i>Wrapped in Crochet</i> (Interweave, 2009), <i>A Knitting Wrapsody</i> (Interweave, 2011), and <i>Seamless Crochet</i> (Interweave, 2011).

Omdahl is a new addition to the cadre, joining the likes of her contemporaries Fassett, Epstein, Mably, and others. It&#x2019;s hard to imagine crochet BK (Before Kristin) because her creative and skillful use of its best qualities&#x2014;lacelike, intricate stitches and modularization&#x2014;defines every one of her previous books (e.g., Wrapped in Crochet, 2008; Crochet So Fine, 2010). In her new title, she reexamines edgings&#x2014;used singly, in multiples, and as stand-alone projects&#x2014;in terms of their making: top down, bottom up, side to side, and the always welcome miscellaneous. Each of the more than 40 patterns includes a chart, written directions, a color photograph of the finished swatch, and very frequent tips (e.g., the mermaid scales could be used as an overall fabric). Names are picturesque and somewhat descriptive: deco scallops, pinecone, open leaf, and circle coins, for instance. Rarely are all the patterns in this type of reference book appealing, yet from the wonderfully draped Ephesus cowl to the fun-and-funky Petra wrap skirt, every one of the 10 projects is a winner. --Barbara Jacobs</p><h2>A Season to Celebrate</h2><p><b><i>Make it a merry Christmas with four stories of the special way the holidays warm our hearts...</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>CHRISTMAS HOMECOMING * Fern Michaels</b><br> Former Air Force Pararescueman Kevin Matthews is back home in Texas, working at his family&#x2019;s Christmas tree farm while deciding his next move.

In <i>Abel and Cain</i>, the original book, long out of print, is reissued in a fully revised translation; <i>Cain</i> appears for the first time in English.<br><br><i>The Death of My Brother Abel&nbsp;</i>zigzags across the middle of the twentieth century, from the 1918 to 1968, taking in the Jazz Age, the Anschluss, the Nuremberg trials, and postwar commercialism. At the center of the book is the unnamed narrator, holed up in a Paris hotel and writing a kind of novel, a collage of sardonic and passionate set pieces about love and work, sex and writing, families and nations, and human treachery and cruelty. In&nbsp;<i>Cain</i>, that narrator is revealed as Aristide Subics, or so at least it appears, since Subics&#x2019; identity is as unstable as the fictional apparatus that contains him and the times he lived through. Questions abound: How can a man who lived in a time of lies know himself? And is it even possible to tell the story of an era of lies truthfully? Primarily set in the bombed-out, rubble- strewn Hamburg of the years just after the war, the dark confusion and deadly confrontation and of Cain and Abel, inseparable brothers, goes on.</p><p><b>Gregor von Rezzori&nbsp;</b>(1914&#x2013;1998) was born in Czernowitz, Bukovina, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During World War II, he worked as a radio broadcaster in Berlin and published his first novel. From the late 1950s on, Rezzori had parts in several French and West German films. Among his best-known work is the Bukovina Trilogy&#x2014;which includes&nbsp;<i>Memoirs of an Anti-Semite</i>,&nbsp;<i>An Ermine in Czernopol</i>, and the memoir&nbsp;<i>The Snows of Yesteryear</i>&#x2014;all of which are published by NYRB Classics.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>David Dollenmayer&nbsp;</b>has translated works by Rolf Bauerdick, Bertolt Brecht, Martin Walser, and many others. Dollenmayer translated&nbsp;<i>Cain&nbsp;</i>for&nbsp;<i>Abel and Cain</i>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Joachim Neugroschel&nbsp;</b>(1938&#x2013;2011) was a translator of French, German, Italian, Russian, and Yiddish literature. He also published poetry and translated and edited multiple anthologies of Yiddish literature. Neugroschel translated an earlier edition of&nbsp;<i>My Brother Abel</i>, which was then revised for&nbsp;NYRB Classics&#x2019;&nbsp;<i>Abel and Cain</i>. He also translated Rezzori's&nbsp;<i>Memoirs of an Anti-Semite</i>for NYRB Classics.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Marshall Yarborough&nbsp;</b>is a translator of German literature and a writer. He has revised Joachim Neugroschel's original translation of&nbsp;<i>My Brother Abel</i>for&nbsp;<i>Abel and Cain</i>.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>Joshua Cohen&nbsp;</b>is a novelist and short story writer. His works include the novels&nbsp;<i>Witz&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Book of Numbers</i>.&#x201c;If a great novel can be recognized by its obsessions, its characters and, above all, its tone, then <i>The Death of My Brother Abel</i> is unquestionably great. Rezzori addresses the major problems of our time, and his voice echoes with the disturbing and wonderful magic of the true storyteller...His is a turbulent, torrential story, full of passion, fire, regret, remorse-stained by anger toward the bourgeoisie, the changing times we live in&#x2014;the proverbial Zeitgeist&#x2014;and especially the Second World War and postwar profiteers. Rezzori&#x2019;s inspiration is fueled by a feverish nostalgia for the past and an even greater nostalgia for an improbable, if not impossible, future. This is no classical novel, not even a modern one; it is its own kind of book, a novel within a novel, or more precisely a number of novels within a novel....Like all true novels, <i>The Death of My Brother Abel</i> provides no answer. The book may come to us from another time, another universe; but we believe in it, and that is what matters.&#x201d; &#x2014;Elie Wiesel, <i>The Washington Post</i> (1985) <br><br> &#x201c;Any reader of European literature who has not read Gregor von Rezzori has committed the unthinkable.

In <i>Worship Words</i>, the third volume in the Engaging Worship series, the authors make a careful examination of the role and use of language in the worship of the church. Their goal is to help pastors and worship leaders come to a renewed appreciation and understanding of words in worship and to inspire them to use words more intentionally--to the greater glory of God and the greater blessing of God's people. Topics in this reflective yet highly practical book include dimensions of language, repetition, authenticity, metaphor, tradition, lament, and worship planning. It is broad-ranging in its audience, addressing important questions that cut across worship styles and various church traditions.</p><p><b>Learning the Grammar of Worship<br><br></b>In <i>Worship Words</i>, Debra and Ron Rienstra carefully examine the role and use of language--in praying, singing, and preaching--in the worship practices of the church.

Their insights on the words of prayers, hymns, and sermons move us from the chatty excesses of much worship today to language that is lively, crisp, inviting, profound, and full of wonder."--<b>Thomas G. Long</b>, Candler School of Theology, Emory University<br><br>"This book is an extraordinarily rich treasure chest of new insights, the best of research, and time-tested wisdom. Because of the unusual combination of their brilliant literary, musical, and theological gifts, the Rienstras offer phenomenal contributions to all of us who care about the church's worship. I most heartily recommend this book to everyone who seeks to glorify God fittingly."--<b>Marva Dawn</b>, author of <i>Reaching Out without Dumbing Down</i>, <i>A Royal "Waste" of Time</i>, and <i>Talking the Walk<br><br></i>"I keep only classic worship books on my shelves. <i>Worship Words</i> will be there, assuming I ever get it back from my worship musician friends. Who knew! Music isn't everything!"--<b>Sally Morgenthaler</b>, author of <i>Worship Evangelism<br><br></i>"What a stretching book full of rich ideas and thoughtful challenges to all of us who design worship experiences! I will put <i>Worship Words</i> in a spot on my bookshelf where it can be reached easily and used often as a resource for my own thinking and planning and to remind me of the profound significance of the language we use to call people to worship, to sing praise and lament, and to offer prayers to a holy and sovereign God.

They&#x2019;re an unlikely pair at an elite East Coast boarding school (she&#x2019;s Jewish; he&#x2019;s Korean American) and hardly shy when it comes to their sexuality. Aviva is a formerly bookish girl looking for liberation from an unhappy childhood; Seung is an enthusiastic dabbler in drugs and a covert rebel against his demanding immigrant parents. In the minds of their titillated classmates&#x2015;particularly that of Bruce Bennett-Jones&#x2015;the couple lives in a realm of pure, indulgent pleasure. But, as is often the case, their fabled relationship is more complicated than it seems: despite their lust and urgency, their virginity remains intact, and as they struggle to understand each other, the relationship spirals into disaster.<br><br> The Virgins is the story of Aviva and Seung&#x2019;s descent into confusion and shame, as re-imagined in richly detailed episodes by their classmate Bruce, a once-embittered voyeur turned repentant narrator.

Cort, Voss, and me.<br> <br>We&#x2019;re high school seniors, at long last, and it&#x2019;s the privilege of seniors to take up these spots in front of the dormitories, checking out the new bodies and faces. Boys with big glasses and bangs in their eyes, girls with Farrah Fawcett hair. Last year&#x2019;s girls have already been accounted for: too ugly or too studious or too strange, or already hitched up, or too gorgeous even to think about.<br><br>It&#x2019;s long odds, we know: one girl here for every two boys. And the new kids don&#x2019;t tend to come on these buses shuttling from the airport or South Station. Their anxious parents cling to the last hours of control and drive them, carry their things inside the neat brick buildings, fuss, complain about the drab, spartan rooms. If there&#x2019;s a pretty girl among them, you can&#x2019;t get close to her for the mother, the father, the scowling little brother who didn&#x2019;t want to drive hundreds of miles to get here. We don&#x2019;t care about the new boys, of course. We&#x2019;ll get to know them later. Or not.<br> <br>She turns her ankle as she comes down the bus steps--just a little wobble--laughs, and rights herself again. Her sandals are tapered and high. Only a tiny heel connects with the rubber-coated steps. She wears a silky purple dress, slit far up the side, and a white blazer. Her outfit is as strange in this place--this place of crew-neck sweaters and Docksiders--as a clown&#x2019;s nose and paddle feet. Her eyes are heavily made up, blackened somehow, sleepy, deep. She waits on the pavement while the driver yanks up the storage doors at the side. She points and he pulls out two enormous matching suitcases, fabric-sided, bright yellow. His muscles bulge lifting them onto the pavement.<br><br>I jump up. Cort and Voss are still computing, trying to figure this girl out, but I don&#x2019;t intend to wait. Voss makes a popping sound with his lips, to mock me and to offer his respectful surprise. After all, I supposedly already have a girlfriend.<br><br> Do you need some help?&#x201d; I ask her.<br><br>She smiles slowly, theatrically. Her teeth are very straight, very white. Orthodontia or maybe fluoride in the water. I wonder where she&#x2019;s from. City, fancy suburb? It suddenly hits me. She&#x2019;s one of <i>those</i>. I can see it in her dark eyes, the bump in her nose, her thick, dark, kinky hair.<br><br> I&#x2019;m in Hiram,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>Let me recreate her journey.<br> <br>She awakens in her big room at an hour when it is still dark, pushes open the curtains of her four-poster bed. Little princess. Across the hall, her brother is still sleeping. He&#x2019;s four years younger than she is: twelve. She makes herself breakfast: a bagel with cream cheese, O.J., and a bowl of Cheerios; she&#x2019;s always ravenous in the morning. She eats alone. Her mother, in her bathrobe, reads stacks of journals upstairs. Her father is shaving. He doesn&#x2019;t like to eat in the morning. He brings her to the airport but they say nothing during the long drive through the flat gray streets of Chicago. She hopes that he&#x2019;ll say he&#x2019;ll miss her, that he&#x2019;ll pretend this parting takes something out of him. She was the one who asked to go away, but in the car her belly acts up, she&#x2019;s queasy. She thinks she may need to rush to the bathroom as soon as they get to O&#x2019;Hare. She wishes she hadn&#x2019;t eaten so much. If her father would act like he might miss her, is afraid for her, she could be a little less afraid for herself. She has practiced her walk, her talk, everything she needs to present herself. She is terrified of going somewhere new simply to end up invisible again.<br><br>One long heel sinks into the mud. The past days have brought late-summer rains to New Hampshire, and although the air is now dry, the grass between the parking areas and the dormitories is soft and mucky. This is a girl used to walking on city pavement, concrete. She laughs and pulls herself out. She is determined to make it seem as if everything that happens to her is something she meant to happen, or can gracefully control. She avoids the wetter grass but in a moment she sinks again. Oh boy,&#x201d; she says. Her dress is long, almost to her ankles. I put down her suitcases and hold out my hand; she takes it and I pull. Her freed shoe makes a sucking sound. When I go over the sound in my mind later, it strikes me as obscene. Her suitcases are heavy, heavy as I&#x2019;ve since learned only a woman&#x2019;s luggage can be. It&#x2019;s only a little farther to her dorm. She tells me that she&#x2019;s an upper--what other high schools call a junior--and we exchange names. <i>Aviva Rossner</i>. She repeats mine, Bruce Bennett-Jones, like she&#x2019;s thinking it over, trying to decide if it&#x2019;s a good one.<br><br>She walks ahead of me instead of following, perhaps intending me to watch her small ass shifting under the white jacket. The wind lifts the hem of her dress, pastes it against her long bare leg. The Academy flag whips around above us and clings to the flagpole in the same way. The smell of ripened apples floods the air. We&#x2019;re on the pavement, finally; she click-clacks to the heavy door and opens it for me. Strong arms on such a slender girl. Someone&#x2019;s playing piano in the common room, a ragtime tune. Aviva starts up the stairs, expecting me to bring the bags. It&#x2019;s strictly against the rules for a boy to go up to the residential floors. I go up.<br><br>Inside the dorm, the light is dim. The walls are cream-colored and dingy, the floors ocher. She counts out the door numbers until she finds hers: 21. I put the suitcases by the dresser, the same plain wooden dresser that sits in my room and in every student room on campus. Her suitcases contain we&#x2019;ll all see in the days to come V-necked angora sweaters, slim skirts, socks with little pom-poms at the heels, teeny cut-off shorts, cowboy boots, lots of gold jewelry, many pouches of makeup.<br>There&#x2019;s a mirror above the dresser. I catch a view of myself: sweaty forehead, damp curls. Aviva&#x2019;s roommate is not here yet. The closet yawns open, wire hangers empty.<br><br> Thank you <i>so much</i>,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>I give the front door a push. It hits dully against the frame, doesn&#x2019;t shut. Aviva has plenty of time to do something: slip into the hallway, order me to go away. She regards me with a patient smile. I am going to slow down the action now, relating this; I want to see it all again very clearly. Like a play being blocked--my stock-in-trade. And so: I push again and the door grinding shut is the loudest and most final sound I have ever heard. Aviva steps back to lean against it and let me approach. She&#x2019;s a small girl and moving close to her I feel, for once, that I have some size. The waxy collar of her jacket prickles the hair on my forearms. Her neck is damp and slippery, and her mouth, as I kiss it, tastes like cigarettes and chocolate. I picture her smoking rapidly, furtively, in the little bathroom on the plane. Her hair smells a little rancid. The perfume she put on this morning has moldered with sweat and travel and now gives off an odor of decayed pear.<br><br> Don&#x2019;t open your mouth so wide,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>My feet are sweating in my sneakers. My crotch itches. My scalp itches. She drops her hand and I see that her fingernails are painted a pearly pink.<br><br>She tilts her head against the door and laughs. Her thick curls swarm. I could bite her exposed neck. I do not want to get caught, sent home. I see my father&#x2019;s hand raised up to hit me and know I&#x2019;m about to step off a great ledge. In a panic I reach for the doorknob, startling Aviva. I open the door carefully, listen to the stairs and hallways. It&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; she says, although how can she know this? But she happens to be correct. There&#x2019;s the oddest emptiness and silence as if these moments and this place were set aside just for us amid the busyness of moving-in day at the Academy. Aviva gives the door a bump with her ass to shut it again, but I insert myself into the opening and slide past her, fleeing down the stairs and out into Hiram&#x2019;s yard.<br><br>Cort and Voss are no longer sitting on the bench in front of Weld.

The process began in the Scottish Lowlands nearly a century before, when tens of thousands of people &#x2013; significantly more than were later exiled form the Highlands &#x2013; were moved from the land by estate owners who replaced them with livestock or enclosed fields of crops.<br><br>These Clearances undeniably shaped the appearance of the Scottish landscape as it is today as they swept aside a traditional way of life, causing immense upheaval for rural dwellers, many of whom moved to the new towns and cities or emigrated. Based on pioneering historical research, this book tells the story of the Lowland Clearances, establishing them as a wider part of the process of Clearance which affected the whole country and changed the face of Scotland forever.</p><p>Peter Aitchison is the author of Children of the Sea: The Story of the Eyemouth Disaster (Tuckwell Press, 2001) and co-author, with Andrew Cassell of The Lowland Clearances (Tuckwell Press, 2003)<br><br></p><h2>Little Saint (Modern Library (Paperback))</h2><p>In the early 1970s, Hannah Green and her husband came upon a small village called Conques, curled like a conch shell in the mountains of south-central France. Entranced, she returned to this numinous place again and again, drawn to the story of the little saint whose spirit fills the lives of the people there. Housed in the village&#39;s yellow stone basilica sits the gold reliquary of Sainte Foy, who was beheaded in the fourth century for refusing to deny her faith before a Roman consul. Little Saint, a book written in ecstasy, is at once a moving and passionate tribute to Sainte Foy, a lyrical evocation of daily life in Conques, and a vivid chronicle of the author&#39;s intensely felt spiritual journey.</p><p>As evidenced by her successful novel <i>The Dead of the House</i>, Hannah Green possessed an acute awareness of early adolescence, the time in life we call coming of age. It's no surprise that Green became entranced and eventually dedicated to a 12-year-old girl, who was known as Saint Foy. Betrayed by her father in 303 A.D., the French girl called Faith was tortured and beheaded for her refusal to worship the pagan goddess Diana and renounce her devotion to Christ.<p> Green narrates in the first person, recounting her reaction and fascination when she first traveled to Conques, France, and saw the golden statue of Saint Foy (with the girl's bones embedded in the statue's heart). Although pilgrims from all centuries and all parts of the world have paid homage to Saint Foy's statue, Green had not anticipated the deep visceral reaction she would have when she first beheld the little saint. "It is a shrine," she writes. "And in some mystic way it suggests to the mind's eye more strongly than any imagined likeness could the presence of Saint Foy herself as she was, with her young fresh skin and the radiance, the life, in her face, the light, and as she is: bone and spirit come to God."</p><p> This is a three-layered, masterful piece in which Green offers a biography of this young saint and the influence she's had over the centuries, a profile of the highly unique village that hosts her statue, and finally a memoir of Green's own spiritual epiphanies born from this saintly encounter. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><br><b>Early comments on Little Saint</b><br><br>Alix Kates Shulman, author of <i>Drinking the Rain</i>:<br><br>"This strange and beautiful book, with its magical sentences that dance and sing right off the page into the reader's heart, seamlessly weaves the remote past into the living present more than any work I know.<br><br>Learned, complex, exuberant, and deeply personal, this meditation on the millennia-long life of a French child martyr is a fitting climax to Hannah Green's devoted life of letters."<br>Fae Myenne Ng, author of <i>Bone</i>:<br><br>"In this glorious work, Hannah Green takes us to the ancient village of Conques, into the world of the sacred and the simple everyday.

Madame Benoit, the artist Kalia, the devoted P�re Andr�, and hear stories of hardship, joy, and faith, even of the mischievous streak of their beloved saint. It is one day;<br>it is Eternity.

She recounts the day-to-day realities of living in a city under siege, where food has to be consumed or thrown out because there is no way to preserve it, where eventually people cannot sleep until the nightly bombing commences, where packs of stray dogs roam the streets (and provide her own dog Salvi with a harem) and rats invade homes. Through it all, al-Radi works at her art and gathers with neighbors and family for meals and other occasions, happy and sad. <br><br>In the wake of the war, al-Radi lives in semi-exile, shuttling between Beirut and Amman, travelling to New York, London, Mexico and Yemen. As she suffers the indignities of being an Iraqi in exile, al-Radi immerses us in a way of life constricted by the stress and effects of war and embargoes, giving texture to a reality we have only been able to imagine before now. But what emanates most vibrantly from these diaries is the spirit of endurance and the celebration of the smallest of life&#x2019;s joys.</p><p>&#x201c;I searched for recent books about Iraq that described it as a real country.

With a myriad of depression remedies on the market, from prescription drugs to herbs, and a rapidly increasing number of people seeking relief from depression, Cousens contends that his program incorporates the best of both conventional and holistic techniques. Cousens's five-step program aims to restore balance to disrupted biochemical processes by increasing the intake of mood-boosting amino acids, vitamin supplements and essential fatty acids and by creating a diet and lifestyle that promote physical and mental well-being. Cousens also discusses the reasons why women are more prone to depression, the limitations of antidepressants and how the suggestions in this book can help people break addictions, including alcoholism and related disorders (ADHD, eating disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder). Anyone who has struggled with depression and found little relief with prescription drugs (Cousens reports that some studies indicate that people who receive no treatment fare as well as those who receive counseling and drugs) will find a lot to consider in this far-reaching look at what remains a debilitating element of many lives.

The relationship that develops between them involves both transference-countertransference reactions (projection) and genuine human feeling. What are the psychological dynamics behind this therapeutic encounter? how do they differ from what happens between two people in any situation? What is the difference between relationships based on projection and those characterized by psychological separation? And when is love not just projection? This revealing study, addressed to both layman and professional, offers answers to these questions from the point of view of Jungian psychology. &#34;My concern,&#34; writes the author, &#34;is with the psychological subtleties involved in any human encounter, and especially those in the intimate relationship that develops in analysis.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Forty Wooden Boats: A Third Catalog of Building Plans</h2><p>These are newest designs added to WoodenBoat&#39;s collection since the publication of fifty Wooden Boats and Thirty Wooden Boats.

G.D.W. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Lizzie Siddal: The Tragedy of a Pre-Raphaelite Supermodel</h2><p><b>Before the modern supermodel, there was Lizzie Siddal, whose image captivated a generation&#x2013;and whose life ended tragically in a laudanum-soaked suicide. </b><br> Saved from the drudgery of a working-class existence by Dante Rossetti, the young Pre-Raphaelite poet and painter who became her lover, Lizzie Siddal was one of the most famous faces in Victorian Britain and a pivotal figure in London's artistic scene. Today, even those who do not know her name recognize her as Millais's doomed Ophelia and Rossetti's beatified Beatrice. Exploring the many parallels to our contemporary worlds of art and fashion, Lucinda Hawksley looks behind the celebrated muse to reveal a talented poet and artist in her own right.</p><p>Lucinda Dickens Hawksley is the great-great-great granddaughter of Charles Dickens and a patron of the Charles Dickens Museum in London. She has written more than 20 books, including <i>Katey: The Life and Loves of Dickens's Artist Daughter</i> (Doubleday UK). A part-time lecturer as well as a writer, Lucinda is an expert in Dickens's family life and has been awarded a fellowship to study the life of Augustus Dickens (Charles's brother and the original "Boz") at the Newberry Library in Chicago.This book traces the life of Lizzie Siddal, who, from her humble beginnings as a shop girl, became a central figure of the Pre-Raphaelite movement by the time she died at 32 from a self-inflicted overdose of opiates. Today, readers are used to stories of small-town hopefuls using modeling as a springboard to wider artistic success (think Marilyn Monroe or Andie MacDowell), but Siddal, Hawksley claims, was the first. As a model and then an artist in her own right, this remarkable woman crossed paths with some of Victorian England's greatest artistic luminaries, appearing in masterworks by Walter Deverell, William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and supported by Ford Madox Brown and John Ruskin. Hawksley recounts Siddal's life in exhilarating and painful detail, providing a glimpse of the internal and external forces that contributed to her self-destruction. Because direct evidence is scant-few of Siddal's letters or prose writings survive-scholars have inferred a great deal from the words of others and Siddal's own paintings. In doing so, Hawksley sometimes overreaches, coming across less like a biographer than a conjectural psycholoanalyst; on the whole, however, her work on this important figure is solid, lively and lucid. Scholars of the period will find the book of great interest, as will those wishing to learn more about women in the Victorian art world or about the Pre-Raphaelites in general. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This ambush was followed by a torpedo strike that blew a forty-foot hole in the starboard side of the ship. Lacking the capacity to defend themselves, thirty-four sailors were killed and 174 wounded, many for life. By the end of the day, Israel had confessed to having been the aggressor, simultaneously arguing that the attack had been an &#34;accident&#34; and a &#34;mistake.&#34;The facts said otherwise. So intense and sustained was the attack - it lasted for nearly an hour and a half - so specific was the aiming for the antennae and satellite dish on deck, that it was scarcely credible that Israel&#39;s aggression was not deliberate; such was the view of Marshall Carter, the director of the National Security Agency, his deputy director Louis Tordella, and Richard Helms, the Director of Central Intelligence.Based on interviews with more than forty survivors, knowledgeable political insiders, and Soviet archives of the period, investigative writer Joan Mellen presents evidence suggesting complicity between US and Israeli intelligence in the attack on Liberty and the more than fifty-year long cover-up. What were the underlying motives? Was this a false flag operation conducted in the midst of the Six-Day War? Was it conceivable that Israel would have initiated such an operation without a green light from the United States?For the sake of justice, truth and the murdered and surviving sailors, this is a story demanding to be told.</p><p><b>Joan Mellen</b> is professor emerita at Temple University, where she taught literature and creative writing for fifty years, and the author of twenty-four books including, most recently, <i>Faustian Bargains: Lyndon Johnson and Mac Wallace in the Robber Baron Culture of Texas</i>; <i>The Great Game in Cuba: CIA and the Cuban Revolution</i>; <i>Our Man in Haiti: George de Mohrenschildt and the CIA in the Nightmare Republic</i>; and <i>A Farewell to Justice: Jim Garrison, JFK's Assassination and the Case That Should Have Changed History</i>.

It is a continuation of her tireless and tenacious study of President Lyndon Baines Johnson and his administration, providing her readers with details that have not been made known to the American public.<br><br>Why is this accurate account so vital to the future of America? As an eyewitness, a survivor of the attack, and a witness to the US government&#x2019;s deception, I am very much aware of the events. My hometown, upbringing, and church and the US Navy provided me with the moral character and determination to complete our mission despite any adversities. It is my love of country that forces me to want the truth told. I have observed the whole scale of lies, deceit, and forgery by the US Navy, who were ordered to do so by our government officials, orchestrated by their commander in chief. The American public needs to know what was done to the USS <i>Liberty</i> crew and to our nation for the sole purpose of protecting our relationship with Israel and profiting for political gain on the backs of the <i>Liberty</i> crew.<br><br>Therefore, prepare to devour Ms. Mellen&#x2019;s account of this event and time period, <i>Blood in the Water: How the US and Israel Conspired to Ambush the USS </i>Liberty. She has uncovered details that have been deliberately hidden from your eyes to prevent you from forming a better understanding of the consequences of our silence. Please take this information to heart and share it with your family and friends. Joan Mellen&#x2019;s book is that important for future American generations to understand the abuses that took place during the Johnson years. I deeply appreciate Ms. Mellen&#x2019;s ability to document these events so that we can take steps to return to the form of governing our founding fathers gave us. If we do not learn from what her book provides us, our future is in jeopardy.<br><br>&#x2014;Ernest A. Gallo, President, USS<i> Liberty</i> Veterans Association<br>From the Preface<br><br>At the dawn of the Six-Day War,... <i>Liberty</i> was rushed to the Eastern Mediterranean. On June 8, she was trolling in international waters at her normal cruise speed of five knots, the speed they traveled when they were on station and doing their intelligence collection, twelve and a half miles off the coast of Egypt. In a bloody, unprovoked, and systematic attack that continued for an hour and a half, Israeli jet fighter planes&#x2014;their hulls blackened to conceal their country of origin, in defiance of international law&#x2014;blasted the unarmed <i>Liberty</i>. They were followed by torpedo boats brandishing machine guns.<br><br>For more than fifty years, the Survivors (the use of the uppercase is their designation) have sought an explanation for this attack, clearly designed to murder everyone on board and send their ship to the bottom of the sea. Intelligence gathering on the high seas is lawful, and it becomes&nbsp;illegal, naval historian Walter Jacobsen says, only when it infringes upon &#x201c;protected features of the public order in the coastal state,&#x201d; which <i>Liberty</i> did not do. It turns out that<i> Liberty</i> was not gathering intelligence on Israel at all.<br><br>The United States professed that it was not a participant in any way in the Six-Day War, an event that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. noted had &#x201c;given Johnson the little respite he wanted from Vietnam.&#x201d; Yet the decimation of the Egyptian Air Force on the first day of the war would not have been possible without the participation of US F-4 planes doing aerial surveillance photography that Israel lacked the technological know-how itself to accomplish.<br><br>Where documents elucidating these events have emerged, they have been heavily redacted.<br><br><i>Blood in the Water</i> is an effort to penetrate the motives for this attack. History may be defined as what is not yet known, hidden corners that illuminate events that seem otherwise inexplicable. Please be so kind as to consider this effort, this book, in the light of its unsatisfactory predecessors. Some components of one agency (CIA) will be revealed to have known the attack was coming, while others, appalled, were unable to stop it. CIA was not a monolith, and those who did not support this operation included Richard Helms, the director of Central Intelligence himself.<br><br>Along the way, I have been guided by the words of members of the intelligence services with access to the truth of what happened and who refused to participate in the cover-up. Among them was a CIA asset named Wilbur Crane Eveland, who requested of Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles, his longtime friend, that he be removed from duty in the Middle East so that he would not be complicit in the injustices he was certain would come.<br><br>Allen Dulles acknowledged to his asset Eveland that &#x201c;the CIA and Israel&#x2019;s Mossad had worked jointly to monitor developments within the Soviet Union and Russia&#x2019;s satellites, and even before the Egyptian-Czech arms agreement, the Israelis had warned that Russia had plans to arm&nbsp;the Arabs.&#x201d; CIA had monitored Russian arms shipments to the Middle East.<br><br>In 1959, Dulles had told Eveland that CIA&#x2019;s collaboration with Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, left the United States exposed to blackmail and established Israel as the first nuclear power in the Middle East. In 1972, General Matityahu Peled of the Israeli army stated in the Israeli daily, <i>Ha&#x2019;aretz</i>, that &#x201c;the thesis that the danger of genocide was hanging over us in June 1967 and that Israel was fighting for its physical existence is only bluff which was born and developed after the war.&#x201d;<br><br>Government documents allow that Israel did not act alone in this operation and therefore cannot be blamed for the devastation by itself. The fifty-year cover-up has been tightly held and respected by every president from Lyndon Johnson, a principal in these events, through Barack Obama.<br><br>Available documents have been few and far between. Sometimes they arrive from the unlikeliest sources, like Mossad chief Meir Amit, who distributed the minutes of his pivotal May 1967 meeting with CIA station chief John Hadden to interested Israeli journalists. Israel argued, falsely, that the USSR had &#x201c;instigated&#x201d; the Six-Day War and had targeted Dimona, Israel&#x2019;s secret nuclear arms facility. Israel continued for fifty years to argue that the attack on the ship was an &#x201c;accident,&#x201d; passing along this disinformation to its assets like Avner Cohen, author of <i>Israel and the Bomb</i>, who attempted to pass it along to me. It was also Cohen, resident as a &#x201c;scholar&#x201d; in the United States, who reported to former Mossad chief Efraim Halevy that the memoir about Hadden written by Hadden&#x2019;s son, <i>Conversations with a Masked Man: My Father, the CIA, and Me</i>, had finally been published. Halevy replied, &#x201c;I thought we had taken care of that.&#x201d; It was a rare glimpse into Israel&#x2019;s shameless interference in US publishing.<br><br>Thomas Lowe Hughes, heading up State Department intelligence in the 1960s, told me there was no one in the government who saw any value in the truth about the USS <i>Liberty</i> emerging. That a cover-up had descended on these events was taken for granted. As Nicholas Katzenbach, then an undersecretary of state, remarked to Hughes, &#x201c;What good would it do?&#x201d;<br><br>Katzenbach was echoing the very view held in Israel after the collapse of its terrorist &#x201c;Operation Susannah&#x201d;: &#x201c;What good could come of an investigation?&#x201d; The truth was, at best, an inconvenience. Katzenbach had never been a proponent of speaking the truth to the public, as he revealed three days after the Kennedy assassination.<br><br>&#x201c;The public must be satisfied that Oswald was the assassin,&#x201d; he wrote in a memorandum to Lyndon Johnson&#x2019;s aide, Bill Moyers, &#x201c;that he did not have confederates who are still at large; and that evidence was such that he would have been convicted at a trial.&#x201d; Discussion was anathema. &#x201c;Speculation about Oswald&#x2019;s motivation ought to be cut off,&#x201d; Katzenbach decreed. Katzenbach had been chosen by FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover &#x201c;to head off public speculation or Congressional hearings of the wrong sort.&#x201d; Katzenbach began to write his memorandum on the Sunday after the assassination, the same general time when J. Edgar Hoover, writes historian Rex Bradford, was writing memos to the same effect.<br><br>When Katzenbach was asked, &#x201c;How are you going to pursue this with the Israelis, namely the <i>Liberty</i>?,&#x201d; he responded, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not going to. What good would it do?&#x201d; He had gotten the message that <i>Liberty</i> was a nonissue, and that the sooner it was behind us, the better. &#x201c;It will do nothing but damage our friends politically.&#x201d;<br><br>In conversation with me, Hughes speculated that Katzenbach &#x201c;thought it would just produce an enormous maelstrom of political controversy.&#x201d;<br><br>I asked, &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t we have a better country if we had the truth?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who knows?&#x201d; Hughes said.<br><br>History has revealed that some distinguished figures in American&nbsp;government were appalled by the attack and knew how it came about, but kept silent. They include the chief of naval operations, Admiral David Lamar McDonald, who published a series of autobiographical interviews with the Naval Institute Press, yet did not mention the USS<i> Liberty</i>.<br><br>To blame Israel alone for this attack on innocent Americans is like talking about the Holocaust, as Donald J. Trump did on International Holocaust Remembrance Day in January 2017, without mentioning the Jewish people. A Trump spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, told CNN the omission was intentional because the administration &#x201c;took into account all of those who suffered&#x201d;&#x2014;echoing, the <i>New York Times</i> noted, &#x201c;the position of neo-Nazis and Holocaust deniers who work to play down the genocide of Jews.&#x201d; Trump repeated this travesty of history in August 2017 when he wanted to blame &#x201c;both sides&#x201d; for the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.<br><br>That his son-in-law&#x2019;s Holocaust-survivor grandmother was a founder of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum fazed Trump not at all. So the fifty years of silence and obfuscation about the attack on the USS<i> Liberty</i> have a continuing legacy: it is acceptable to lie and distort, so long as you&#x2019;re not called out on it.<br><br>Over the years, one specious motive for the attack after another has been advanced. One has it that Israel feared that <i>Liberty</i> had discovered its plan to invade Syria the next day, June 9, and so had to pulverize the ship, to sink it with all hands, as it most obviously intended to do. In fact, Moshe Dayan, commanding the Israel Defense Forces, had not completed his plan for Syria before <i>Liberty </i>was bombarded, nor was the ship conducting surveillance on Israel. It was under instructions specifically not to process Israeli intercepts.<br><br>A variation submitted by Joseph Daichman in his history of Mossad was that the Soviets had been intercepting American radio signals. Should<i> Liberty</i> not be removed, the Soviets would inform Egypt that Israel had moved troops to the Golan and left its border with Egypt undefended. None of this can be supported.<br><br>Wilbur Eveland came closest to the truth in his memoir, <i>Ropes of Sand</i>: &#x201c;Unless the United States wished the Russians and Arabs to learn of joint CIA-Mossad covert operations in the Middle East and of Angleton&#x2019;s discussions before the 1967 fighting began, the questions of the lost American ship and how the war originated should be dropped.&#x201d;<br><br>The CIA-Mossad joint covert operation was the attack on the USS<i> Liberty</i>, &#x201c;the lost American ship.&#x201d; Nor can the attack on the ship be mentioned without the name &#x201c;James Angleton&#x201d; entering the discussion and his role being spelled out.</p><h2>How to Make $100,000 a Year Gambling for a Living</h2><p>Is there really such a thing as a professional gambler? The answer is an unequivocal, &#34;Yes!&#34; This book&#39;s authors are but two examples. Many thousands of people around the country make a good living exclusively from gambling. It is not easy, but it can be done. The key is to understand which games are beatable and know how to beat them. David Sklansky and Mason Malmuth have spent many years writing about the finer points of poker, blackjack, and other beatable games. As you will see in the book, those other &#34;games&#34; are horses, sports, progressive slots and video poker, casino tournaments, and special promotions. They don&#39;t include craps, roulette, keno, or baccarat for reasons they&#39;ll explain. This book, was written for the not quite as experienced aspiring gambler. It shows you everything you need to learn and do if you want to gamble for a living from both the practical and the technical standpoints. The rest is up to you.</p><p>About David Sklansky <p>David Sklansky is generally considered the number one authority on gambling in the world today. Besides his ten books on the subject, David also has produced two videos and numerous writings for various gaming publications. His occasional poker seminars always receive an enthusiastic reception, including those given at the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas. </p><p>More recently, David has been doing consulting work for casinos, Internet gaming sites, and gaming device companies. He has recently invented several games, soon to appear in casinos. </p><p>David attributes his standing in the gambling community to three things: </p><p>1. The fact that he presents his ideas as simply as possible (sometimes with Mason Malmuth) even though these ideas frequently involve concepts that are deep, subtle, and not to be found elsewhere. </p><p>2. The fact that the things he says and writes can be counted on to be accurate. </p><p>3. The fact that to this day a large portion of his income is still derived from gambling (usually poker, but occasionally blackjack, sports betting, horses, video games, casino promotions, or casino tournaments). </p><p>Thus, those who depend on David&#x2019;s advice know that he still depends on it himself. </p><p>About Mason Malmuth </p><p>Mason Malmuth was born and raised in Coral Gables, Florida. In 1973 he received his BS in Mathematics from Virginia Tech, and completed their Masters&#x2019; program in 1975. While working for the United States Census Bureau in 1978, Mason stopped overnight in Las Vegas while driving to his new assignment in California. He was immediately fascinated by the games, and gambling became his major interest. </p><p>After arriving in California he discovered that poker was legal and began playing in some of the public cardrooms as well as taking periodic trips to Las Vegas where he would play both poker and blackjack. In 1981 he went to work for the Northrop Corporation as a mathematician and moved to Los Angeles where he could conviently pursue his interest in poker in the large public cardrooms in Gardena, Bell Gardens, and Commerce. </p><p>In 1983 his first article "Card Domination &#x2014; The Ultimate Blackjack Weapon" was published in Gambling Times magazine. In 1987 he left his job with the Northrop Corporation to begin a career as both a full-time gambler and a gambling writer. He has had over 500 articles published in various magazines and is the author or co-author of 12 books. These include Gambling Theory and Other Topics, where he tries to demonstrate why only a small number of people are highly successful at gambling. In this book he introduces the reader to the concept of "non-self weighting strategies" and explains why successful gambling is actually a balance of luck and skill. Other books he has co-authored are Hold &#x2019;em Poker For Advanced Players, written with David Sklansky, and Seven-Card Stud For Advanced Players written with David Sklansky and Ray Zee. All the "advanced" books are considered the definitive works on these games. </p><p>His company Two Plus Two Publishing has sold over 400,000 books and currently has 22 titles to its credit. These books are recognized as the best in their field and are thoroughly studied by those individuals who take gambling seriously.</p></p><h2>The Family Gathering (Sullivan&#39;s Crossing, 3)</h2><p><strong>Look for Robyn&#x2019;s new book, <em>The Best of Us</em>, a story about family, second chances and choosing to live your best life&#x2014;order your copy today!</strong><br><br><strong>An exceptional storyteller, #1 </strong><strong><em>New York Times</em></strong><strong> bestselling author Robyn Carr beautifully captures the emotionally charged, complex dynamics that come with being part of any family.

His enemies, however, met less-exalted fates. Besides those killed on the battlefield, tens of thousands were officially executed between 1936 and 1945, and as many again became "non-persons." As Spain finally reclaims its historical memory, a full picture can now be given of the Spanish Holocaust-ranging from judicial murders to the abuse of women and children. The story of the victims of Franco's reign of terror is framed by the activities of four key men-General Mola, Quiepo de Llano, Major Vallejo Najera, and Captain Don Gonzalo Aguilera-whose dogma of eugenics, terrorization, domination, and mind control horrifyingly mirror the fascism of Italy and Germany.<br><br> Evoking such classics as <em>Gulag</em> and <em>The Great Terror, The Spanish Holocaust</em> sheds crucial light on one of the darkest and most unexamined eras of modern European history. 16 pages of black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Paul Preston, author of The Spanish Civil War, Franco and Juan Carlos, and The Spanish Holocaust, is the world&#39;s foremost historian on twentieth-century Spain.

Bring your children to a playground, sit yourself down on a bench next to other sunflower-seed-crunching moms, and in ten minutes you&#x2019;ll know whose husband drinks, whose younger sister got pregnant by an unknown party, and who was insulted, again, by her mother-in-law, because they all live together, and so on. But some stories a stranger won&#x2019;t hear. Shameful stories&#x2014;shameful by Russian standards; stories that mix violence, insanity, and jail. What they call <i>extremal </i>in Russian&#x2014;stories too extreme for casual tale-swapping, suitable only for furtive whispering.</p><p>For example, a family of five, say, is living in a three-room apartment in Moscow in the mideighties. They have just enough. Mother and father work, the roof doesn&#x2019;t leak, there are staples in the cupboards, an occasional delicacy in the fridge. There are even two crystal vases on the shelves. One day, while the grandmother and the children are out at a New Year&#x2019;s pageant, the mother tries to kill the father with an ax. That&#x2019;s it. The father disappears to the ER; the mother disappears to a hospital for the insane, to await trial; the crystal vases get sold to pay for the mother&#x2019;s defense; six months later the mother comes home to a wasteland. With her remaining strength she tries to raise the children, while the grandmother grows more and more demented; finally the mother gets cancer. The end.</p><p>This would make a typical Ludmilla Petrushevskaya story. But it also happened in my house, to my family, many years ago. We didn&#x2019;t know at the time there were stories written for us, about us; in the Soviet Union, as the narrator in <i>Among Friends</i> notes wryly, everyone lived as though on a desert island, and especially families like mine, families traumatized&#x2014;and stigmatized&#x2014;by <i>extremal</i>. Petrushevskaya&#x2019;s work was suppressed for decades; only later, after the Soviet Union&#x2019;s collapse, did we find out that all those years when we knew only shame and neglect, in the same city a woman exactly my mother&#x2019;s age, also a mother, was composing story after story and play after play about families like ours&#x2014;ordinary families who had suffered a tragedy.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>The three novellas in this volume tell extreme stories that couldn&#x2019;t be heard for many years&#x2014;censorship wouldn&#x2019;t allow it. Petrushevskaya was unable to publish <i>Among Friends</i> for seventeen years; it existed as samizdat. <i>The Time Is Night</i> was published in Germany in translation before it came out in Russia. When <i>Among Friends </i>and <i>The Time Is Night</i> finally appeared, they weren&#x2019;t alone: a whole wave of previously suppressed works was released at the same time. It turned out that a number of brilliant writers had been trying to tell their own extreme tales about life in the Soviet Union, which was so opaque, so completely shrouded from both the West and its own citizens, that it was impossible to tell what was happening next door, let alone in Siberia. Fedor Abramov wrote about the devastation in the Russian countryside, the sufferings of the millions of peasants; Chinghiz Aitmatov about the government corruption and environmental disasters in Central Asia; Sergei Dovlatov about the horrors of army life; Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Varlam Shalamov about arrests, interrogations, political prisons, and camps; Andrey Platonov about the civil war and the Bolshevik revolution.</p><p>And Petrushevskaya? She described in minute detail how ordinary people, Muscovites, lived from day to day in their identical cramped apartments: how they loved, how they dreamed, how they raised their children, how they took care of their elders, and how they died. She spoke for all those who suffered domestic hell in silence, the way Solzhenitsyn spoke for the countless nameless political prisoners. To write about, say, the woman next door who worked for the post office, some bedraggled Aunt Masha who was left by her husband to raise three children on a salary of ninety rubles when a pair of shoes cost twenty, if you could find them, and who had to care for her paralyzed mother while her teenage son wreaked havoc (all details from Petrushevskaya&#x2019;s stories), took as much art and as much courage as describing one day in the life of Ivan Denisovich. The difference was that Petrushevskaya&#x2019;s subjects were closer to home&#x2014;they weren&#x2019;t exiled out of our sight, out of our mind. They lived across the hall; they shared the room with us; they were my mother and grandmother.</p><p>As both her critics and admirers agree, reading Petrushevskaya is an unforgettable experience. This testifies to the exceptional power of her art, because her characters, by their own admission, don&#x2019;t make particularly fascinating subjects. In this volume, her heroines are tired, scared, impoverished women who have been devastated by domestic tragedies and who see little beyond the question, How to raise a child? How to feed it, clothe it, educate it when there is no strength left and no resources? Such women are boring even to themselves. Anna, the heroine of <i>The Time Is Night</i>, complains that no one wants to know how she lives: not her former friends or colleagues, not the state, not her neighbors&#x2014;she herself can barely stand it. No one wants to know, except for Petrushevskaya. She takes it upon herself to describe her drab characters in such a way that we can&#x2019;t put the book down, and when we finish reading we are overwhelmed by the most profound empathy.</p><p>Nowhere does Petrushevskaya accomplish this feat of imagination more completely than in<i> The Time Is Night</i> (1992), with her portrait of Anna (who, like Solzhenitsyn&#x2019;s Ivan Denisovich, doesn&#x2019;t have a last name, only a patronymic), an unemployed and unpublished poet on the cusp of old age, living in a cramped two-room apartment with her little grandson. Her mother is in a hospital for the insane; her two grown-up children constantly threaten to move in with her&#x2014;one of them does so, at the very end, depriving Anna of the last vestiges of privacy.</p><p>A brief prologue indicates she&#x2019;s talking to us from beyond the grave, but leaves us to wonder how and when she died. Some commentators have assumed from the overwhelming pressure conveyed in Anna&#x2019;s monologue that her death was a suicide. Petrushevskaya denies this interpretation. In a sense, though, the manner of death hardly matters. Whether she died the next day or stumbled around for several more years fulfilling her duties, the part of herself that mattered most to her fades away after the last sentence, where she bids good-bye to &#x201c;all the living&#x201d; who have left her. <i>The Time Is Night</i> is, indeed, the story of two Annas. One is a tall woman with an exhausted face, poorly dressed, with neglected teeth, whose hands smell of cooking oil, and who can&#x2019;t walk past you without making an uninvited comment. She torments her poor daughter but allows her worthless son to manipulate her and rob her. She commits tactless blunders and downright cruelties. This is Anna the hag. But there is another Anna, the one who is telling us all these unattractive facts about herself with such objectivity and humor, and whose sad but rich inner life envelops us the moment we start reading her posthumous diary. This is Anna the poet. It is this Anna that dies at the end of the diary, leaving the hag behind to stumble around a bit longer. </p><p>Duality is also contained in the heroine&#x2019;s name, and her occupation. Petrushevskaya named her after the great Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, who had suffered similar tragedies, yet endured for a very long time. The other poet mentioned is Marina Tsvetaeva, who did in fact kill herself. Petrushevskaya saw her Anna vacillating between Akhmatova&#x2019;s stoic endurance and Tsvetaeva&#x2019;s ultimate self-destruction. Anna&#x2019;s life is objectively extremely hard&#x2014;life during Stagnation (1964&#x2013;82) was hard for everyone who wasn&#x2019;t the ruling elite, and the divorced, unemployed Anna belongs to the most vulnerable and marginalized part of the population. Her tragedies are marked by <i>extremal</i>: her son has been to jail for a violent crime; her mother is dying from schizophrenia; her daughter is homeless. Still, the reader can&#x2019;t fail to notice that some of her problems are self-induced and that despite everything there are many joys available to her. There is her adored grandson; there is her daughter who could be her friend; there are her books, her walks; and, finally, there is her poetry. The famous line by Akhmatova, &#x201c;If only people knew from what muck poetry grows,&#x201d; comes to mind throughout the novella. Anna has a gift, as did Akhmatova, as did Tsvetaeva, as do all talented poets, to translate the filth and muck of reality into harmonious verse. This gift, we are convinced, might have saved her had it been nourished.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>The other monologue in this collection, <i>Among Friends </i>(1988), is Petrushevskaya&#x2019;s best-known and most controversial work. The story it tells is so extreme&#x2014;by peculiar Russian standards&#x2014;that it wouldn&#x2019;t be shared even in a whisper. Many critics and readers interpret it as an attack on Russia&#x2019;s two revered institutions: friendship and motherhood. To this day Petrushevskaya gets criticized at public appearances for her heroine&#x2019;s behavior.</p><p>The novella&#x2019;s heroine, who narrates the story, believes herself to be dying. She lives with an estranged husband, who finally files for divorce, and a young son. Her parents are dead; all she has by way of family is a group of old friends who have known one another since college. It is their custom to convene every Friday in a little apartment that belongs to a married couple, the nucleus of their club. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s imperial and Soviet history, such unofficial networks were a beloved recourse among intelligentsia, allowing them to speak their minds freely&#x2014;something they couldn&#x2019;t do anywhere else in a censored society. Petrushevskaya&#x2019;s &#x201c;friends,&#x201d; however, are deeply apolitical and don&#x2019;t seem to take notice of anything outside their club, including the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Behind their cynicism and snobbishness they think themselves invulnerable, yet when a patrolman pays them a visit they are too terrified to even use the bathroom. In the end, all illusions and pretenses come undone, and cozy gatherings turn into a snake pit. In the notorious closing scene that still sends readers into a fury, the desperate narrator performs an act of violence toward her son, because she believes it to be the only way to ensure that her so-called friends don&#x2019;t abandon him after her death.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>The more recent <i>Chocolates with Liqueur</i> (2002) was conceived as a homage to Petrushevskaya&#x2019;s favorite author, Edgar Allan Poe. This is the first time it appears in English. Its subject is violence against a woman and her children that&#x2019;s committed daily, inside an ordinary home, in view of the numerous neighbors. One of Petrushevskaya&#x2019;s scariest stories, <i>Chocolates</i> is narrated in a light, conversational manner, which makes the novella all the more frightening.</p><p>The heroine is Lelia, a young mother of two who is trying to protect herself and her children from a murderous, psychotic husband. Unfortunately the husband owns the apartment they live in, so Lelia has nowhere to go. The abuse carries on for years, unobserved by anyone. Only the neighbor&#x2019;s pet, a German shepherd, senses Lelia&#x2019;s fear, and in the end it is the dog that saves Lelia and her children. Why Lelia agreed to marry her husband in the first place is part of the novella&#x2019;s mystery. She could have been pregnant by another (we are given to understand), or else she, an orphan without family or friends, could have been flattered by the young man&#x2019;s persistent attention. The chief instrument of his seduction is chocolate filled with sweet liqueur&#x2014;impoverished Lelia&#x2019;s favorite treat. The chocolate is an allusion to the Poe story &#x201c;The Cask of Amontillado,&#x201d; on which this novella is based. In it the perpetrator similarly lures his victim into a mortal trap using the victim&#x2019;s love of sweet wine; in both stories the crime is committed inside a respectable residential building. Out of fear for her children&#x2019;s lives, Lelia is unable even to call for help during the final attack and is prepared to suffer death in silence, another mute victim of domestic tragedy.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>What makes reading Petrushevskaya so disturbing yet so compelling, so depressing yet so exalting? Partly it is her exceptional eye for (often painful) detail. Partly it is the mordantly witty asides of her narrators, both sympathetic and unsympathetic. Perhaps most of all it is what we might call the courage of genius, the willingness to attempt to turn even the extremities of suffering and degradation into lucid, compassionate art. Family and friendship are inescapable and natural, and yet they are also, under these circumstances, hellish and ugly. Those who endure this extreme misery are usually mute. Petrushevskaya endured it, too, but by a kind of miracle was somehow endowed with a power of perception or sympathy, which didn&#x2019;t exempt her from the misery but at least allowed her to record it. All that immense quantity of suffering and squalor would be lost, would disappear into a historical void, if it hadn&#x2019;t found a laureate in her. Suffering is bad enough, but permanent invisibility is even worse. It mitigates the horror, in some mysterious way, when it is witnessed, recorded, transfigured.</p><p>ANNA SUMMERS</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Time Is Night</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Awoman called me, a stranger. &#x201c;My mother&#x201d;&#x2014;she paused&#x2014;&#x201c;has left some papers.

All who know and love Jesus find themselves waiting for some sign of the path he will eventually take. After his baptism, he is at last ready to confront his destiny. At the wedding at Cana, he takes water and transforms it into red wine.&nbsp; Thus, he&#x2019;s recognized as the anointed one and called by God the Father to begin a ministry that will transform an unsuspecting world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Anne Rice&nbsp;is the author of thirty-five books. She lives in Palm Desert, California.Who is Christ the Lord?Angels sang at his birth. Magi from the East brought gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. They gave these gifts to him, and to his mother, Mary, and the man, Joseph, who claimed to be his father.In the Temple, an old man gathered the babe in his arms. The old man said to the Lord, as he held the babe, &#x201c;A light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory for your people Israel.&#x201d;My mother told me those stories.That was years and years ago.Is it possible that Christ the Lord is a carpenter in the town of Nazareth, a man past thirty years of age, and one of a family of carpenters, a family of men and women and children that fill ten rooms of an ancient house, and, that in this winter of no rain, of endless dust, of talk of trouble in Judea, Christ the Lord sleeps in a worn woolen robe, in a room with other men, beside a smoking brazier? Is it possible that in that room, asleep, he dreams?Yes. I know it&#x2019;s possible. I am Christ the Lord. I know. What I must know, I know. And what I must learn, I learn.And in this skin, I live and sweat and breathe and groan. My shoulders ache. My eyes are dry from these dreadful rainless days&#x2013;from the long walks to Sepphoris through the gray fields in which the seeds burn under the dim winter sun because the rains don&#x2019;t come.I am Christ the Lord. I know. Others know, but what they know they often forget. My mother hasn&#x2019;t spoken a word on it for years. My foster father, Joseph, is old now, white haired, and given to dreaming.I never forget.And as I fall asleep, sometimes I&#x2019;m afraid&#x2013;because my dreams are not my friends. My dreams are wild like bracken or sudden hot winds that sweep down into the parched valleys of Galilee.But I do dream, as all men dream.And so this night, beside the brazier, hands and feet cold, under my cloak, I dreamed.I dreamed of a woman, close, a woman, mine, a woman who became a maiden who became in the easy tumult of dreams my Avigail.I woke. I sat up in the dark. All the others lay sleeping still, with open mouths, and the coals in the brazier were ashes.<i>Go away, beloved girl. This is not for me to know, and Christ the Lord will not know what he does not want to know&#x2013;or what he would know only by the shape of its absence.</i>She wouldn&#x2019;t go&#x2013;not this, the Avigail of dreams with hair tumbled down loose over my hands, as if the Lord had made her for me in the Garden of Eden.No. Perhaps the Lord made dreams for such knowing&#x2013; or so it seemed for Christ the Lord.I climbed up off the mat, and quietly as I could, I put more coals into the brazier. My brothers and my nephews didn&#x2019;t stir. James was off with his wife tonight in the room they shared. Little Judas and Little Joseph, fathers both, slept here tonight away from little ones huddled around their wives. And there lay the sons of James&#x2013;Menachim, Isaac, and Shabi, tumbled together like puppies.I stepped over one after another and took a clean robe from the chest, the wool smelling of the sunshine in which it had been dried. Everything in that chest was clean.I took the robe and went out of the house. Blast of cold air in the empty courtyard. Crunch of broken leaves.And for a moment in the hard pebbly street I stopped and looked up at the great sweep of glittering stars beyond the huddled rooftops.Cloudless, this cold sky, and so filled with these infinitesimal lights, it seemed for a moment beautiful. My heart hurt. It seemed to be looking at me, enfolding me&#x2013;a thing of kindness and witness&#x2013;an immense web flung out by a single hand&#x2013;rather than the vast inevitable hollow of the night above the tiny slumbering town that spilled like a hundred others down a slope between distant caves of bones and thirsting fields, and groves of olive trees.I was alone.Somewhere far down the hill, near the sometime marketplace, a man sang in a low drunken voice and a spark of light shone there, in the doorway of the sometime tavern. Echo of laughter.But all the rest was quiet, without a torch to light the way.The house of Avigail across from ours was shut up like any other. Inside, Avigail, my young kinswoman, slept with Silent Hannah, her sweet companion, and the two old women who served her and the bitter man, Shemayah, who was her father.Nazareth did not always have a beauty. I&#x2019;d seen generations of young maidens grow up, each fresh and lovely to behold as any flower in the wild. Fathers did not want their daughters to be beauties. But Nazareth had a beauty now, and it was Avigail. She&#x2019;d refused two suitors of late, or so her father had done on her behalf, and there was a real question in the minds of the women of our house as to whether Avigail herself even knew the suitors had come calling.It fell hard on me suddenly that I would sometime very soon be standing among the torchbearers at her wedding. Avigail was fifteen. She might have been married a year ago, but Shemayah kept her close. Shemayah was a rich man who had but one thing and one thing alone that made him happy, and that was his daughter, Avigail.I walked up the hill and over the top. I knew every family behind every door. I knew the few strangers who came and went, one huddled in a courtyard outside the Rabbi&#x2019;s house, and the other on the roof above where so many slept, even in winter. It was a town of day-to-day quiet, and seemingly not a single secret.I walked down the other side of the slope until I came to the spring, the dust rising with every step I took, until I was coughing from it.Dust and dust and dust.Thank You, Father of the Universe, that this night is not so cold, no, not as cold as it might be, and send us the rain in Your own good time because You know that we need it.Passing the synagogue, I could hear the spring before I saw it.The spring was drying up, but for now it still ran, and it filled the two large rock-cut basins in the side of the hill, and spilled down in glistening streaks to the rocky bed it followed off and away into the distant forest.The grass grew soft here and fragrant.I knew that in less than an hour, the women would be coming, some to fill jugs, others, the poorer women, to wash their clothes here as best they could and beat them on the rocks.But for now the spring was mine.I stripped off the old robe and flung it down into the creek bed where the water soon filled it up and darkened it to where I couldn&#x2019;t see it. I set the clean robe aside and approached the basin. With my cupped hands I bathed in the cold water, drenching my hair, my face, my chest, letting it run down my back and my legs. Yes, cast away the dreams like the old robe, and bathe them away. The dream woman has no name now and no voice, and what it was, that painful flicker when she laughed or reached out, well, that was gone, fading, like the night itself was fading, and gone too was the dust for this moment, the suffocating dust. There was only cold. There was only water.I lay down on the far bank, opposite the synagogue. The birds had begun, and as always I&#x2019;d missed the exact moment. It was a game I played, trying to hear the very first of the birds, the birds that knew the sun was coming when no one else did.I could see the big thick palm trees around the synagogue emerging from the clump of shapeless shadows. Palms could grow in a drought. Palms didn&#x2019;t care if the dust coated every branch. Palms went on as if made for all seasons.The cold was outside me. I think my beating heart kept me warm. Then the first light seeped up over the distant bluff, and I picked up the fresh robe, and slipped it over my head. So good, this, this luxuriously clean cloth, this fresh-smelling cloth.I lay back down again and my thoughts drifted. I felt the breeze before I heard the trees sigh with it.Far up the hill was an old olive grove to which I loved to go at times to be alone. I thought of it now. How good it would be to lie in that soft bed of dead leaf and sleep the day away.But there was no chance of it, not now with the tasks that had to be done, and with the village charged with new worries and new talk over a new Roman Governor come to Judea, who, until he settled in as every other Governor had done, would trouble the land from one end to the other.The land. When I say the land, I mean Judea and Galilee as well. I mean the Holy Land, the Land of Israel, the Land of God. It was no matter that this man didn&#x2019;t govern us. He governed Judea and the Holy City where the Temple stood, and so he might as well have been our King instead of Herod Antipas. They worked together, these two, Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee, and this new man, Pontius Pilate, whom men feared, and beyond Jordan Herod Philip ruled and worked with them as well. And so the land had been carved up for a long, long time, and Antipas and Philip we knew, but Pontius Pilate we didn&#x2019;t know and the reports were already evil.What could a carpenter in Nazareth do about it? Nothing, but when there was no rain, when men were restive and angry and full of fear, when people spoke of the curse of Heaven on the withering grass, and Roman slights, and an anxious Emperor gone into exile in mourning for a son poisoned, when all the world seemed filled with the pressure to put one&#x2019;s shoulder to it and push, well, in such a time, I didn&#x2019;t go off to the grove of trees to sleep the day away.It was getting light.A figure broke from the dark shapes of the houses of the village, hurrying downhill towards me, one hand upraised. My brother James. Older brother&#x2013;son of Joseph and Joseph&#x2019;s first wife who died before Joseph married my mother. No mistaking James, for his long hair, knotted at the back of his neck and streaming down his back, and his narrow anxious shoulders and the speed with which he came, James the Nazirite, James, the captain of our band of workers, James, who now in Joseph&#x2019;s old age was head of the family.He stopped at the far side of the little spring, mostly a broad swatch of dry stones now with the glittering ribbon of water gurgling through the center of it, and I could plainly make out his face as he stared at me. He stepped on one big stone after another as he came across the creek to me. I had sat up and now I climbed to my feet, a common enough courtesy for my older brother. &#x201c;What are you doing out here?&#x201d; he demanded. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with you? Why do you always worry me?&#x201d;I didn&#x2019;t say anything.He threw up his hands and looked to the trees and the fields for an explanation.&#x201c;When will you take a wife?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t stop me, don&#x2019;t put up your hand to me to silence me. I will not be silenced. When will you take a wife? Are you wed to this miserable creek, to this cold water? What will you do when it runs dry, and it will this year, you know.&#x201d;I laughed under my breath.He went right on.&#x201c;There are two men as old as you in this town who&#x2019;ve never married. One is crippled. The other&#x2019;s an idiot, and everyone knows this.&#x201d;He was right. I was past thirty and not married.&#x201c;How many times have we talked about this, James?&#x201d; I asked.It was a beautiful thing to watch the growing light, to see the color coming to the palms clustered around the synagogue. I thought I heard shouting in the distance. But perhaps it was just the usual noises of a town tearing off its blankets.&#x201c;Tell me what&#x2019;s really eating at you this morning?&#x201d; I asked. I picked up the wet robe from the stream and spread it out on the grass where it would dry. &#x201c;Every year you come to look more like your father,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but you never have your father&#x2019;s face really. You never have his peace of mind.&#x201d;&#x201c;I was born worried,&#x201d; he confessed with a shrug. He was looking anxiously towards the village. &#x201c;Do you hear that?&#x201d;&#x201c;I hear something,&#x201d; I said.&#x201c;This is the worst dry spell we&#x2019;ve ever had,&#x201d; he said, glancing up at the sky. &#x201c;And cold as it is, it&#x2019;s not cold enough. You know the cisterns are almost empty. The mikvah&#x2019;s almost empty. And you, you are a constant worry to me, Yeshua, a constant worry. You come out here in the dark to the creek. You go off to that grove where no one dares to go. . . .&#x201d;&#x201c;They&#x2019;re wrong about that grove,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Those old stones mean nothing.&#x201d; That was a village superstition, that something pagan and dreadful had once taken place in that grove. But it was the mere ruins of an old olive press in there, stones that went way back to the years before Nazareth had been Nazareth. &#x201c;I tell you this once a year, don&#x2019;t I? But I don&#x2019;t want to worry you, James.&#x201d;</p><h2>Yo&#39; Mama&#39;s Disfunktional !: Fighting the Culture Wars in Urban America</h2><p>In this vibrant, thought-provoking book, Kelley, &#34;the preeminant historian of black popular culture writing today&#34; (Cornel West) shows how the multicolored urban working class is the solution to the ills of American cities.

Looking at that relationship against the backdrop of the sexual revolution, the Vietnam War, political assassinations, and other events of those tumultuous years, the book examines critically the often-heard assertion that the Beatles changed everything&#x201d; and shows how through the interplay between the group, the fans, and the culture that change came about.<br><br>A generational memoir and cultural history based on hundreds of hours of in-depth interviews with first-generation fans, <i>Beatleness</i> allows readers to experience or re-experience what it was like to be a young person during those eventful and transformative years.

A welcome . . . sociocultural study for the Beatlemaniac bookworm.&#x201d; <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> Candy Leonard&#x2019;s focus on the way the Beatles&#x2019; fans saw them particularly as they changed, musically and otherwise, during the 1960s is both innovative and revealing, and adds a new dimension to how we think of the Beatles and their accomplishments.&#x201d; Allan Kozinn, former <i>New York Times</i> music critic and author of <i>The Beatles: From the Cavern to the Rooftop</i><br><br> Beatlemania was a singular force in the history of the world, and it has never been capably explained in all of its dimensions. But Candy Leonard&#x2019;s <i>Beatleness</i> gets us a little bit closer. This is a soulfully written, genre-defying book that should be of interest to Beatles fans and cultural historians alike.&#x201d; John McMillian, author of <i>Beatles vs. Stones</i><br><br> A new book that&#x2019;s bound to give even a modest fan a unique look at how the Beatles forever changed the world of music.&#x201d; <i>US Airways Magazine</i><br><br> <i>Beatleness</i> demonstrates that the Beatles are an important part of who we are as baby boomers.&#x201d; Paul Briand, <i>Baby Boomer Examiner</i><br><br> <i>Beatleness</i> taps into our generation&#x2019;s collective memory and evokes the sixties through our personal relationship with the Beatles.

Leonard&#x2019;s<i> Beatleness</i>, however, does just that, because she goes straight to a vital (and largely ignored) Fab Four source: the fans. . . . She builds a three-dimensional, completely human tale, the likes of which has never before been tackled by a Beatles author.&#x201d; Allison Johnelle Boron, <i>Goldmine</i><br><br> In producing <i>Breakfast With The Beatles</i> for 25 years, one of my greatest ongoing challenges is trying to describe what it was like when Beatlemania was actually happening. For first-generation and new fans alike, Candy Leonard&#x2019;s Beatleness is the go-to source for exactly that. It goes way beyond the simple chronology of events, explaining why we felt the way we did about The Beatles and their music, and why they were so important to us. In telling the story this way, <i>Beatleness</i> provides a clearer picture of how they changed the world.&#x201d; Dennis Mitchell, producer/host of the globally syndicated, award-winning Dennis Mitchell&#x2019;s <i>Breakfast With The Beatles</i><br><br> Candy Leonard was possessed&#x2019; when she first heard the Beatles, and <i>Beatleness</i> is her story and ours. It&#x2019;s breezy, smart and openhearted, and everyone who grew up with the band or wants to know what that was like will appreciate its insights and feel its emotional impact.&#x201d; Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor, <i>Rolling Stone</i><br><br> Very impressive. <i>Beatleness</i> not only describes what it was like to be a hardcore fan from the beginning (like me), but explains it in a historical and personal context. For forty years of The FEST we&#x2019;ve been celebrating our love for the Beatles with thousands of fans. Now we have a word for it.&#x201d; Mark Lapidos, president, Mark Lapidos Productions and founder, <i>The Fest for Beatles Fans</i><br><br> A very intelligent and well-researched book on a phenomenon that has reached the half-century mark and is still evolving.&#x201d; Dave Schwensen, author of <i>The Beatles at Shea Stadium</i> and <i>The Beatles in Cleveland</i><br><br> From ex-employees to ex-lovers, we&#x2019;ve seemingly heard from everyone associated with the Beatles. <i>Beatleness</i> finally lets us hear from another group: the fans whose lives were forever altered by rock&#x2019;s greatest band. These are vivid snapshots of people who rode the wave and suffered through the crash of Beatlemania as much as anyone who worked for the band.&#x201d; David Browne, author of Fire and Rain: The Beatles,Simon &amp; Garfunkel, James Taylor, CSNY, and the Lost Story of 1970<br><br> I love this book! The beautifully written <i>Beatleness</i> will not only bring to life all the excitement for those that weren&#x2019;t living yet during the Beatle years, it will cause major goosebumps, all over again, to those who were there. It&#x2019;s an incredibly hip and astute account of all the Beatles&#x2019; major happenings that affected so many people around the world who were riveted to their every move.

Drawing upon original sources, the book provides valuable insights into the development of the office of the deacon in the early church and situates it within the context of the church&#39;s total ministry. Dr. Barnett contends that a radical change in the nature and understanding of the church&#39;s ministry took place in the fourth century. A ministry that had included the whole people of God in a horizontal, organic structure gave way to one that was clerical and hierarchical. This change, among other factors, eventually transformed the diaconate into an inconsequential, transitional office on the way to the priesthood. Responding to the present-day revival of the diaconate in the Roman Catholic, Episcopal, Lutheran, and other churches, Barnett calls for a restoration of the office to its original place as full and equal order, thus re-creating the great symbol of the servant ministry that Christ gave to all the church. James Monroe Barnett, now living in retirement in Omaha, is the former rector of Trinity Episcopal Church, Norfolk, NE.</p><p>James Monroe Barnett, now living in retirement in Omaha, is the former rector of Trinity Episcopal Church, Norfolk, NE."...James Monroe Barnett's writing on the diaconate has come at a critical time in the history of contemporary Christianity.

The Psalms reverberate with joy, groan in pain, whimper with sadness, grumble in disappointment and rage with anger. The church fathers employed the Psalms widely. In liturgy they used them both as hymns and as Scripture readings. Within them they found pointers to Jesus both as Son of God and as Messiah. They also employed the Psalms widely as support for other New Testament teachings, as counsel on morals and as forms for prayer. Especially noteworthy was their use of Psalms in the great doctrinal controversies. The Psalms were used to oppose subordinationism, modalism, Arianism, Apollinarianism, Nestorianism, Eutychianism and Monophysitism, among others. More than fifty church fathers are cited here from Ambrose to Zephyrinus. From the British Isles, Gaul and the Iberian Peninsula, we find Hilary of Poitiers, Prudentius, John Cassian, Valerian of Cimiez, Salvian the Presbyter, Caesarius of Arles, Martin of Bruga, Braulio of Saragossa and Bede. From Rome and Italy, we find Clement, Justin Martyr, Callistus, Hippolytus, Novatian, Rufinus, Maximus of Turin, Peter Chrysologus, Leo the Great, Cassiodorus and Gregory the Great. Carthage and North Africa are represented by Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustine and Fulgentius. Fathers from Alexandria and Egypt include Clement, Origen, Dionysius, Pachomius, Athanasius, Cyril and Poemen. Constantinople and Asia Minor supply the Great Cappadocians--Basil the Great and the two Gregorys, from Nazianzus and Nyssa--plus Evagrius of Pontus and Nicetas of Remesiana. From Antioch and Syria we find Ephrem, John Chrysostom, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret of Cyr, Philoxenus of Mabbug, Sahdona and John of Damascus. Finally, Jerusalem, Palestine and Mesopotamia are represented by Eusebius of Caesarea, Aphrahat, Cyril, Jacob of Sarug, Jerome and Isaac of Nineveh.

Curtis, Journal for the Study of the Old Testament, 33.5, 2009)</p><h2>Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth (Harvard Paperback, HP 21)</h2><p><p>The spell that the West has always exercised on the American people had its most intense impact on American literature and thought during the nineteenth century. Henry Nash Smith shows, with vast comprehension, the influence of the nineteenth-century West in all its variety and strength, in special relation to social, economic, cultural, and political forces. He traces the myths and symbols of the Westward movement such as the general notion of a Westward-moving Course of Empire, the Wild Western hero, the virtuous yeoman-farmer&#x2015;in such varied nineteenth-century writings as <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, the great corpus of Dime Novels, and most notably, Frederick Jackson Turner&#x2019;s <i>The Frontier in American History</i>. Moreover, he synthesizes the imaginative expression of Western myths and symbols in literature with their role in contemporary politics, economics, and society, embodied in such forms as the idea of Manifest Destiny, the conflict in the American mind between idealizations of primitivism on the one hand and of progress and civilization on the other, the Homestead Act of 1862, and public-land policy after the Civil War.</p><p>The myths of the American West that found their expression in nineteenth-century words and deeds remain a part of every American&#x2019;s heritage, and Smith, with his insight into their power and significance, makes possible a critical appreciation of that heritage.</p></p><p>&#x201c;A very illuminating study in the history of ideas. Its principal theme is the rise and decline of the conception of the West as an agrarian utopia the myth of the &#x2018;garden of the world&#x2019; that implanted itself so deeply in the imagination of nineteenth-century America. Professor Smith brings to his study an unusual adeptness in the integration of material from different fields, and, what is more important, an admirable feeling for shadings and distinctions, for the complexly organic relationship between empiric fact and what human emotion and imagination would make of it... <i>Virgin Land</i> achieves a kind of clarification of its subject that makes it, one feels, a landmark in the interpretation of the West.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Smith&#x2019;s book is a work of solid scholarship on a facet of our history that has not always been assessed at its proper importance.

Admittedly not the marrying type, she protects her sensitive heart with an icy shield, never allowing herself to grow close to anyone. The arrival of Owen Christiansen, however, starts to melt away her defenses, and she finds herself falling for the charming man on the run from his past. When their lives are suddenly jeopardized onboard, they realize there is more between them than simply being shipmates. They both survive, sharing secrets and a marriage proposal in the process. When Scotty fulfills her promise to Owen to go back with him to the Christiansen home in Deep Haven, Minn., she finds herself mixed up in clearing Owen&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s name in a murder drama. After her stay with the Christiansen family lasts longer than expected, Scotty must choose which life she really wants. Warren (<i>The Wonder of You</i>) has shaped a beautifully dynamic romance that teaches the value of family and forgiveness through a modern-day prodigal-son story of redemption. (Publishers Weekly)<br><br>Warren&#x2019;s Minnesota-set Christiansen Family series, including <i>Always on My Mind</i> and <i>The Wonder of You</i> (both 2015), draws to a close with this tale. The focus here is on Owen, the troubled youngest brother of the boisterous, fiercely loyal clan, as he attempts to make amends. Far from home, Owen is part of an Alaskan fishing crew when he begins to develop feelings for Scotty, the captain&#x2019;s daughter and one tough crew member. A near-death experience draws them together, but both are afraid of opening up old wounds. Owen&#x2019;s brother, Casper, tracks him down, and all three return to the Christiansen home in Deep Haven. Things are complicated as Owen deals with the consequences of his reckless past and Scotty learns how to trust others. Devoted fans of Warren&#x2019;s series will love this prodigal-son story, as will new readers. Everyone can relate to the characters&#x2019; constant struggles to be more than the sum of their past mistakes, and readers will warm to the grace and hope that propel the growing love between Owen and Scotty.

Penelope Rosemont draws on a lifetime of such experiences in her collection of essays, <em>Surrealism: Inside the Magnetic Fields</em>. From her youthful forays as a radical student in Chicago to her pivotal meeting with Andr� Breton and the Surrealist Movement in Paris, Rosemont&#x2014;one of the movement's leading exponents in the United States&#x2014;documents her unending search for the Marvelous.</p><p><em>Surrealism</em> finds her rubbing shoulders with some of the movement's most important visual artists, such as Man Ray, Leonora Carrington, Mimi Parent, and Toyen; discussing politics and spectacle with Guy Debord; and crossing paths with poet Ted Joans and outsider artist Lee Godie. The book also includes scholarly investigations into American radicals like George Francis Train and Mary MacLane, the myth of the Golden Goose, and Dada precursor Emmy Hennings.</p><p><strong>Praise for <em>Surrealism:</em></strong></p><p>"Rosemont is not delivering dry abstractions, as so many academic 'specialists,' but telling us about warm and exciting human encounters, illuminated by the subversive spirit of Permanent Enchantment."&#x2014;<strong>Michael L�wy</strong>, author of <em>Ecosocialism</em></p><p>"This compelling and well-drawn book lets us see the adventures, inspirations, and relationships that have shaped Penelope Rosemont's art and rebellion."&#x2014;<strong>David Roediger</strong>, author of <em>Class, Race, and Marxism</em></p><p>"The broad sampling of essays included here offer a compelling entry point for curious readers and an essential compendium for surrealist practitioners."&#x2014;<strong>Abigail Susik</strong>, professor of art history, Willamette University</p><p>"Rosemont's welcome memoir has a double virtue, as testament to the enduring radiance of Surrealism, and as a memento to the Sixties, revealing a sweetly beating wonderment at the heart of that absurdly maligned decade."&#x2014;<strong>Jed Rasula</strong>, author of <em>Destruction Was My Beatrice: Dada and the Unmaking of the Twentieth Century</em></p><p>"Artist, historian, and social activist, Rosemont writes from the inside out. Like a rare, hybrid flower growing out of the earth, she complicates, expands, and opens the strange and beautiful meadow where Surrealism continues to live and thrive.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Sabrina Orah Mark</strong>, author of <em>Wild Milk</em></p><p>"In this wide-ranging collection of essays, Penelope Rosemont, long a keeper of surrealism's revolutionary flame, shows how a penetrating look into the past can liberate the future."&#x2014;<strong>Andrew Joron</strong>, author of <em>The Absolute Letter</em></p><p>"Rosemont recreates the feverish antics and immediate reception her close-knit, sleep-deprived, beat-attired squad find in the established, moray-breaking Parisian and international surrealists.

In the 1960s, in addition to being members of the Industrial Workers of the World and Students for a Democratic Society, she and her late husband Franklin Rosemont co-founded the Chicago Surrealist Group, which published the magazine <em>Arsenal/Surrealist Subversion</em> and the book imprint Black Swan Press. In the 1980s, she became one of the directors of Chicago&#x2019;s historic left-wing press Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company. She has co-edited several surrealist publications, including <em>Free Spirits: Annals of the Insurgent Imagination</em> (City Lights 1982) and <em>The Forecast is Hot! Tracts &amp; Other Collective Declarations of the Surrealist Movement in the United States</em> (Black Swan 1997), and is the editor of the landmark collection <em>Surrealist Women: An International Anthology</em> (Texas 1998). Her writings include two poetry collections <em>Athanor</em> (Black Swan 1971) and <em>Beware of the Ice</em> (Surrealist Editions 1992), the essay collection <em>Surrealist Experiences</em> (Black Swan 1999), and the memoir <em>Dreams &amp; Everyday Life</em> (Charles Kerr 2008). She has participated in many international exhibitions of surrealism.</p><p><strong>Chapter Three</strong></p><br><p><strong>Paris Days &#x2013; Winter to Spring</strong></p><br><p>Our counterculture bookshop group in general had been thinking more and more about a cultural critique, about the synthesis of An- thropology, Freud, and Marxism that for us centered around surreal- ism. Herbert Marcuse&#x2019;s work <em>Eros and Civilization </em>and its discussion of Freud was important to us, especially his concept of surplus re- pression. There has been a concerted attack on Freud, an attempt to discredit Freud and especially discredit the idea of the repressiveness of civilization. The Right sees this not altogether incorrectly as the basis of the &#x2018;60s radicalism. After all aren&#x2019;t we the freest people imag- inable? We have the freedom to buy anything we want. What else is freedom? The entire concept of the repressiveness of society has been dismissed. A mistake.</p><br><p>By December 1965, Franklin and I thought IWW efforts were slowing down and were eager to go to Paris. Robert Green and Lester Dor� were already traveling there and sending back reports. Lester sent Provo and Revo literature from Amsterdam and wrote that there was a tremendous youth scene. Maurice Nadeau&#x2019;s <em>History of Surreal- ism </em>had just come out in English and we read with enthusiasm, &#x201c;the surrealist state of mind or, better still surrealist activity is eternal. Understood as a certain tendency, not to transcend but to penetrate reality, to &#x2018;arrive at an ever more precise and at the same time ever more passionate apprehension of the tangible world.&#x2019;&#x201d; I read <em>Nadja: </em>a mysterious and sensuous tribute to a free spirited woman. &#x201c;Who am I?...perhaps everything amounts to knowing who or what I &#x2018;haunt,&#x2019;&#x201d; Breton had written. Fascinated by the idea of wandering the streets of Paris directed by chance alone. What would Andr� Breton be like, I wondered?</p><br><p>First, we planned to go to London and visit the anarchist Free- dom Press there. We expected to be gone six months or more, spend- ing most of the time in London, maybe a week in Paris. Only a week in Paris because we didn&#x2019;t know anyone in Paris that we could stay with and felt our French needed a lot of work. Further, we were shy about meeting Andr� Breton. We were just kids; we hadn&#x2019;t really done anything we considered significant yet. But drawn to surre- alism, we wanted to go and see for ourselves what was happening. What would the surrealists be doing, thinking, would we be able to meet them? Would we be able to meet Breton? He was nearly sev- enty, but still living at 42 Rue Fontaine where he had lived when he wrote <em>Nadja. </em>We wondered, would we be able to see the famous 42 Rue Fontaine?</p><br><p>When we left it was indeed dismal days for the bookshop; Soli- darity Bookshop was in storage, driven out of 713 Armitage by irate neighbors, the school board, police, red squad, etc. Our tolerant landlord, Jerry the hairdresser, was visited by the FBI and he worried his Beauty Shop business would suffer. We were determined, howev- er, not to give up. Tor Faegre and Bernard Marszalek were going to search for a new store front. Larry and Dotty DeCoster would soon arrive on the scene. At Union Station we boarded the train for New York. From there our plane left for London.</p><br><p>New York, December 1965</p><br><p>During our brief stop in New York we met Nicolas Calas at his apart- ment. Probably the tallest surrealist, Calas was close to seven feet. From his coffee table I picked up a copy of the surrealist journal <em>La Br�che</em>; in it I found the names Franklin Rosemont and Larry DeCoster. Their friend Claude Tarnaud had sent a letter to Robert Benayoun in Paris, describing his meeting with them. The letter had been published two years ago, in 1963. What a surprise, we were astonished, it seemed a remarkable sign.</p><br><p>We left and strolled randomly through the streets of New York unmindful of the raging blizzard about us. We came upon a man standing on a corner in the snow near Rockefeller Center, but stand- ing there so rigid and so tall, I thought he was a statue, wearing a long cape that flowed in the wind, a Viking helmet, shoulders and beard frosted over with snow. Even up close I couldn&#x2019;t tell if he was alive. So I said, &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;</p><br><p>&#x201c;I am God!&#x201d; came a deep, booming voice with long pauses be- tween words, I had to smile I was not expecting to run into a god standing on a street corner in a Manhattan snow storm, &#x201c;but people call me Moondog.&#x201d;</p><br><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that you&#x2019;re carrying?&#x201d; said I.</p><br><p>&#x201c;Music, music that I wrote. Do you want to buy some?&#x201d; Well, it turns out this was Moondog, a remnant of the old beat scene gone practically catatonic on a street corner.</p><br><p>Then to the airport and on to our BOAC plane, this was our first flight, first time up in the air, but I wasn&#x2019;t frightened, I was elated because of my desire to see the Earth from the air, because of my excitement of going, going across the ocean, going to England, going to France, going on a great adventure, doing it together with my lover.</p><br><p>Leaving just before Christmas the plane was not crowded, it was a long flight, perhaps eight hours; the plane was so empty we stretched out, lying down over three seats and slept a bit. Mostly we enjoyed being in cloudland and staring down at the gray endless ocean and dreaming of what could be awaiting us on the other side of the vast wilderness of water.</p><br><p>Our Adventures at Heathrow Airport</p><br><p>At Heathrow Airport in London, we got in line, we were dressed in simple beatnik style, black turtleneck shirts and jeans. Franklin was wearing his black leather jacket; I was wearing a fringed black tweed shawl Franklin&#x2019;s mother made for me; it made me look spectacularly countercultural. We waited in line impatiently to get through cus- toms. Finally, it was our turn; the agent asked us &#x201c;How long are you planning to stay?&#x201d;</p><br><p>&#x201c;Three to six months.&#x201d;</p><br><p>&#x201c;How much luggage have you got?&#x201d; &#x201c;Four pieces.&#x201d;</p><br><p>&#x201c;Rather a lot of luggage, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; He commented and asked, &#x201c;How much money have you got?&#x201d;</p><br><p>&#x201c;A thousand dollars.&#x201d;</p><br><p>&#x201c;What are your occupations?&#x201d; Franklin answered, &#x201c;Musician.&#x201d;</p><br><p>&#x201c;Mmm,&#x201d; said the agent our first clear indication of hostility. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve rather enough musicians here already! What about the draft?&#x201d;</p><br><p>Franklin answered, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a student deferment.&#x201d;</p><br><p>Agent, &#x201c;Well, you can&#x2019;t very well be a student and be here at the same time, can you? You can&#x2019;t do it in this country at least. I think you are trying to avoid the draft, trying to emigrate to our country.&#x201d;</p><br><p>We insisted this was not the case. It didn&#x2019;t work. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to send you back on the next plane.&#x201d;</p><br><p>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; I interrupted, &#x201c;I want to appeal, I want to see someone else about this.&#x201d;</p><br><p>&#x201c;Well, there&#x2019;s no one else to see tonight, we&#x2019;re going to keep you in detention overnight and then back you go.&#x201d;</p><br><p>Very dejected, we were shunted off to overnight detention in some cement-block rooms that looked like motel rooms but with no windows, and were locked in for the night. We weren&#x2019;t the only ones; there were quite a few people from Pakistan who were likewise enjoying the hospitality of Heathrow.</p><br><p>In the morning, however, we were ready with our arguments, these would probably have fallen on deaf ears except we had pur- chased only a one-way ticket and had come on BOAC, the British state-owned airline. Therefore, because of international agreements, they would have to return us at their own expense. We were escorted around the airport from bureaucrat to bureaucrat accompanied by an entourage of two guards, (so we wouldn&#x2019;t escape) and two luggage carriers. This situation attracted plenty of attention from other trav- elers who thought we must be bank robbers or at least rock stars. In retrospect it has provided us with a lot of amusement.</p><br><p>After arguing with three different sets of officials I finally said, &#x201c;How about if we purchase a ticket to Paris; you can ship us on to Paris and you&#x2019;ll be rid of us!&#x201d; This definitely appealed to them, pass- ing this bureaucratic problem on to the French, we put out the cash and bought the tickets and they made arrangements for us to be on the very next plane to Paris, and I do mean the very next.</p><br><p>Most humorous of all was our departure. In fact, they called over to the airfield and held a plane, then piled us and all our luggage and all our guards into a large, black limousine and drove us out onto the airfield right up to the plane. The boarding ramp had already been removed and had to be brought back for us, I could see faces gawking out the plane&#x2019;s windows; planes wait for no one; we were hurried up the stairs accompanied by our guards and escorted to our seats in the crowded plane. The last words from the chief guard to the stewardess were: &#x201c;Here is their passport, don&#x2019;t give it to them until you are off the ground!&#x201d; (This was so we didn&#x2019;t bolt and jump off the plane in a daring last second escape, I suppose?) It made us seem really desperate and dangerous, heads turned, everyone had to get a look at us, but no one said anything, international spies, jewel thieves at least! And I thought it only happened in movies.</p><br><p>This short flight was fraught with anxieties; would we get into France? There was a large black X on our passport and a message &#x201c;refused entrance to U.K.&#x201d; After landing, we got in line with all the other tourists; there were lots; French Customs was just waving peo- ple through as they held up their passports. We walked by but just didn&#x2019;t believe it for a while, didn&#x2019;t believe we had actually gotten through customs and were in France. Then we were jubilant, elated</p><br><p>. . . but, what next? Somehow we had to figure out what to do now.</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Christmas in Paris!</p><br><p>Our trip began with an amazing demonstration of objective chance. We started for London but here we were in Paris. Little did we real- ize how fortunate this was. The surrealist group had several special events going on.</p><br><p>When we arrived in France at Le Bourget Airport on December 22, we had no plans, no place to stay, and no one had been informed of our arrival, suddenly we were just there; disoriented but ecstat- ic! All our careful plans demolished. Our relatives back in the U.S. didn&#x2019;t have a clue as to where we were, at last report, the day before, I had called my mother and told her we were being held in detention in London, the relatives wouldn&#x2019;t know where we were for days.</p><br><p>As soon as we could find a phone at Le Bourget, we tried to call Robert Benayoun, the member of the Surrealist group with whom we&#x2019;d been corresponding. We looked up his number in the Paris phone directory and dialed anxiously, a woman answered, she didn&#x2019;t speak English. Then she informed us that M. Benayoun was very ill. Too ill, in fact, to come to the phone. What to do? I explained we were friends of his from Chicago. She was astonished, she didn&#x2019;t know that M. Benayoun had any friends in Chicago. When Franklin said, &#x201c;Is this the home of Robert Benayoun, <em>Surr�aliste</em>?&#x201d; She hung up.</p><br><p>We just couldn&#x2019;t stand airports or their atmosphere for one more minute. We moved our luggage to a locker and equipped with <em>Europe on $5.00 A Day</em>, caught a bus for Paris.</p><br><p>Outside the window a curious world passed by, new and mod- ern buildings were rising next door to tiny one-room cottages hardly large enough for a bed and chair, and barely high enough to stand up in, but surrounded by neatly kept tiny gardens.</p><br><p>We arrived at Les Invalides air terminal somewhere in central Paris, we didn&#x2019;t have a map yet, so we had no idea where we were, but left and wandered instinctively down toward the Seine and across a bridge, just soaking in wonderful new sensations on all sides. Not believing it, everything seemed so different, we just wandered and looked at the people, the buildings, the traffic. Finally, we woke up to the fact that we had to find a place to stay and much of the day had already passed. I&#x2019;m not sure if Hotel des Acacias was in <em>Europe on</em></p><br><p><em>$5.00 A Day, </em>but I think it was. It was already towards evening then, the day after the shortest day of the year, and around 4:00 p.m. when we wandered there. It was snowing lightly and beautifully against the dark Paris stones. The Rue des Acacias bent gracefully. We went into the hotel and I practiced my phrase-book French, &#x201c;Avez-vous un chambre pour deux? Combien?&#x201d;</p><br><p>The room was about $5.00 and that seemed exceedingly ex- pensive to us, but we were just exhausted; I was too exhausted to walk another step, so we agreed on it. It was quite a lovely hotel and room, I remember going to the casement window, opening it wide and looking out over the chimneys and rooftops with Paris all lit up and glowing and beautiful snow falling, somehow not really still believing it, we were actually in Paris. The view out the window was so beautiful, I would have been satisfied if we had done nothing else for our trip.</p><br><p>For a moment we thought about going out for food, but we were exhausted and just lay down, fell asleep, and didn&#x2019;t awaken until late the next morning.</p><br><p>Amazingly, when we awoke, we discovered we were still in Paris; it hadn&#x2019;t been a dream, so here we were, two kids in our early twen- ties having grown up with the corn of the vast Midwest. Franklin had at least been to Mexico, I had never really been anywhere outside the country except to Canada for a day. But suddenly the boring sameness of everyday life had vanished, everything seemed different, unexpected, sensuous, new, its routine peeled away. Just being there standing on the street was an adventure.</p><br><p>Well, according to our infallible guide, <em>Europe on $5.00 A Day</em>, we could find a cheaper hotel on the Left Bank so we headed for St. Germain des Pres near the Sorbonne, and thus a student center in Paris. We walked down the steps into the Metro, after first admir- ing and running our hands over the beautiful turn-of-the-century art nouveau entrances designed by Hector Guimard, purchased two second-class tickets and consulted the Metro machine for finding our route. You pressed a button indicating where you wanted to go, and the entire route with transfer points lit up on a glass map of the whole system in red, yellow, or green lights. The Metro had a sub- stantial tunnel system for getting passengers to their trains, and iron gates near the boarding platform closed automatically as the train pulled into the station to keep frantic riders from mobbing the train and not letting it leave the station, and Metro riders were usually frantic.</p><br><p>The first hotel we checked out on the Left Bank was awful, a closet with a bed in it that slanted severely downhill. But, then, at 52 Rue Dauphine we found Le Hotel du Grand Balcon. This time, more cautious, we asked to see the room, it was a beautiful light room with French windows that looking down on Rue Dauphine from the fourth floor, by U.S. ideas of floors, at $2.22 per day.</p><br><p>In our room a sink and bidet, down the hall was the toilet, the halls and stairs were lit by a lumerie (a timed light), which we nev- er timed correctly, consequently we were always running down the stairs in the dark. There was not a lot of heat, so we spent much of our time in bed, reading with all of our clothes on, including extra sweaters. We had to wear all of our clothes outside, also, so instead of presenting a fashionable lean Parisian appearance, we looked more like Russian bears.</p><br><p>People asked us if we were from Marseilles, a more working class, tougher place than Paris. When they found we spoke English, they asked if we were from Can...</p></p><h2>The Bare Bones Broth Cookbook: 125 Gut-Friendly Recipes to Heal, Strengthen, and Nourish the Body</h2><p><p>From the founders of Bare Bones Broth Company, 125 delicious recipes for making and cooking with the latest food trend that's taking the culinary and wellness communities by storm: bone broth.</p><p>Bone broth is one of mankind's oldest foods&#x2014;and healthiest, boasting one of the most complete nutritional profiles of any food on earth.

The only Chinese citizen known to have openly and steadfastly opposed communism under Mao, she rooted her dissent in her Christian faith--and expressed it in long, prophetic writings done in her own blood, and at times on her clothes and on cloth torn from her bedsheets.<br><br>Miraculously, Lin Zhao's prison writings survived, though they have only recently come to light. Drawing on these works and others from the years before her arrest, as well as interviews with her friends, her classmates, and other former political prisoners, Lian Xi paints an indelible portrait of courage and faith in the face of unrelenting evil.<br><br></p><p><b>Lian Xi </b>is a professor of world Christianity at Duke Divinity School. The author of <i>Redeemed by Fire </i>and <i>The Conversion of Missionaries</i>, he lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina."<i>Blood Letters</i> is one of the most important books on the Communist-era rights movements to be published in recent years.

Presented in "live seminar" format, this book offers rich information and specific examples of how to work successfully in helping people change. Specific methods are presented for changing habits, for congruently finally saying "no" when that is appropriate, eliminating compulsions, building self-concept, becoming more self-referenced and less vulnerable to others' opinions, utilization of timelines and time frames for planning and motivation, shifting the relative importance of criteria/values, and much more.</p><p>(from the Introduction) We have presented the patterns in this book as explicitly and systematically as we can, in order to make it easy for you to learn them. Like a road map, these directions will only be useful if you take the time to actually follow them, and use your senses to experience the actual territory that they lead you to. We have presented them in great detail, and warned you about all the mistakes we and others have made with them, to make it hard for you to use them inappropriately. Once you have taken the time to learn these methods thoroughly, you can become more flexible and artistic in utilizing them with clients, with confidence that your behavior will remain systematic and effective. <p>Many people accuse NLP of being technological, with the implication that it is cold and unfeeling. However, those same people are happy to use the technology of central heating to help their houses warm, instead of the smoky fire used by their ancestors. They also use antibiotics and immunization to keep their children healthy without thinking about the incredibly complex technology behind it. </p><p>Months of warm feelings won't help a child who is a poor speller, or release him from the resulting ridicule, feelings of failure and self-criticism; an hour or two of NLP technology can teach him how to spell and provide him with a sense of accomplishment and self-worth. All the empathy in the world won't help a phobic; a half-hour of NLP technology can release her from a life punctuated with terror. Holding the hand of a dying friend may ease his passing; appropriate medical technology may save his life. </p><p>Of course any technology can be misused by delivering it in a cold, unfeeling way. We have listened to nurses whose "bedside manner" must have been learned from a tape recording of Lucretia Borgia, and therapists who speak in the tonality of Adolph Hitler. This book is more technological than most, because we know that detailed technology gets results, and that the "coldest" technology can be delivered with humanity and respect. </p><p>We learned much of the material in this book directly from Richard Bandler in a small seminar in early 1984. In that seminar he taught us a number of specific patterns, most of which are included in this book. But more important, he demonstrated the tools of the trade: how to use fine distinctions, specific questions, and procedures for further exploration and discovery. Richard also often demonstrated without explaining, described events cryptically, or dropped tantalizing hints. Although this was often frustrating, it also whetted our curiosity and motivated us to explore further. Since then, we have been using the tools he taught us to follow up some of those tantalizing hints and develop specific patterns in sufficient detail that they can be more easily learned by others. </p><p>For over three years now we have been teaching this material in our Advanced Submodality Trainings. Much of this book has been edited from transcripts drawn from many different trainings. These segments have been woven together and presented as if they occurred in one training, both for your ease in reading, and to retain the conversational style and format of the live teaching. Other parts we have written without referring to tapes of transcripts. Most of the time we do not indicate which of us is speaking; after months of editing by both of us, we often don't know, and it doesn't matter anyway. We do identify ourselves in transcripts of demonstrations which are also available on videotape. </p><p>In many ways, this book is a continuation of Richard Bandler's book, Using Your Brain--for a CHANGE, which we edited two years ago. As we were writing this book we have presupposed that readers will have read Using Your Brain, and will have a background understanding of basic submodality patterns. If you don't have that background, we strongly recommend that you acquire it before reading this book, in order to get full value from the patterns in this book. </p><p>We also strongly recommend that you read the chapters in this book in order. Sequence, or syntax, of experience is a major organizing principle in NLP, and the sequence of chapters in this book has been carefully thought out. Many of the later chapters presuppose that ;you have already read and understood earlier chapters. If you read a later chapter without the background provided by earlier chapters and Using Your Brain, it will be more difficult for you to understand the material completely and thoroughly. </p><p>There is an old joke about the human brain being "the only self-maintaining all-purpose computer that can be created by unskilled labor." However, it's also a computer without an owner's manual. The patterns developed by NLP are essentially human "software"--ways to organize your experience that can be learned, a cultural/social resource, like all the other products of human creativity and inventiveness. The material we present here explores the mental patterning that makes us who we are, and provide tools that you can use to quickly change how you respond.

As the first full-length ethnography of sex tourism in Brazil, this pioneering study treats sex tourism as a complex and multidimensional phenomenon that involves a range of activities and erotic connections, from sex work to romantic transnational relationships. Erica Lorraine Williams explores sex tourism in the Brazilian state of Bahia from the perspectives of foreign tourists, tourism industry workers, sex workers who engage in liaisons with foreigners, and Afro-Brazilian men and women who contend with foreigners' stereotypical assumptions about their licentiousness. She shows how the Bahian state strategically exploits the touristic desire for exotic culture by appropriating an eroticized blackness and commodifying the Afro-Brazilian culture in order to sell Bahia to foreign travelers. <br></p><p>&nbsp;How sexism, racism, and socio-economic inequality interact in the Brazilian sex industry<br>Erica Lorraine Williams is an assistant professor of anthropology at Spelman College.<br></p><h2>The Magdalene: Volume II of the O Manuscript</h2><p>&#x2018;A story that, for too long, has been crying out to be told&#x2019; Henry Lincoln, author of&nbsp;<i>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</i>&nbsp;&#x2018;The heights that the climb may lead you to are in proportion to the depths to which you are willing to delve&#x2019; Mary Magdalene is arguably one of Jesus&#x2019; best-known disciples and yet we know very little about her.

Beach-bum-turned-judge Whit Mosley is summoned to a yacht where the black-sheep son of a senator lies dead. Was it suicide, fueled by a family tragedy? Or did an obsessed killer use the dead man as a pawn in a twisted game? When Whit defies political pressure and conducts an inquest, he and Detective Claudia Salazar expose a nest of drug lords, con artists, and power-hungry sharks - all out for blood. With their careers -- and their lives -- at stake, Whit and Claudia must unearth a lethal trail of passion and deceit that lies buried not in the warm sands of Port Leo but in the icy recesses of the human heart.</p><p>Jeff Abbott is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of fourteen novels.

Pete brings some heavy baggage with him, the least of which is his producer and girlfriend, Velvet Mojo. When Pete turns up dead, seemingly by his own hand, rookie Judge Whit Mosley and police detective Claudia Salazar open an investigation that may cost him the election and them their lives. Agatha and Macavity award-winner Abbott (Distant Blood) populates his narrative with a number of colorful characters including a pompous southern sheriff, a wrestler turned evangelist, a shadowy psychotic killer named Blade, a corrupt female senator and a delightful sidekick who sticks to his ethics even if they don't always coincide with judicial law. Despite the author's penchant for gauche one-liners ("I been in law enforcement thirty years, partner, and you're wet behind both ears and balls."), he offers fresh, original descriptions and well-written fistfights. This intricately woven, fast-moving mystery will keep readers guessing until the novel's final confrontation. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Black Condition ft.

I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br><br> Prince Ashur Cortas drew to a stop only a few paces away. He eyed both Jonas and Nic through narrowed, silvery-blue eyes that stood out against his dark tan complexion like the glinting edge of a blade at dusk. <br><br> The only sounds to be heard for a few long moments were the squawk of a nearby seabird as it plunged downward to catch a fish and the gentle, steady splash of the water against the waiting Limerian ship with its black and red sails.<br><br> &#x201c;Nicolo,&#x201d; the raven-haired prince said with a nod. &#x201c;I know you must be very confused to see me again.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I . . . I . . . what . . . ?&#x201d; was Nic&#x2019;s only reply. The scattering of freckles over his nose and cheeks contrasted boldly with his blanched complexion. He drew in a shaky breath. &#x201c;This is impossible.&#x201d;<br><br> Ashur raised a dark brow at the boy, hesitating only briefly before he spoke. &#x201c;In my twenty-one years of life I&#x2019;ve come to realize that very little in this world is impossible.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I watched you <i>die</i>.&#x201d; The last word sounded as if it had been dragged painfully from Nic&#x2019;s throat. &#x201c;What was that? Just another lie? Another scheme? Another plan that you didn&#x2019;t feel the need to tell me about?&#x201d;<br><br> Jonas was surprised that Nic dared to speak to a member of royalty with such insolence. Not that Jonas himself had much respect for royals, but Nic had spent enough time in the Auranian palace, side by side with its princess, to know it wasn&#x2019;t wise to be this openly rude.<br><br> &#x201c;It was no lie. What happened at the temple was not a scheme.&#x201d; Ashur swept his gaze over the Limerian ship, which was ready for imminent departure from the Jewel of the Empire&#x2019;s crowded, busy docks. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll explain more once we&#x2019;re at sea.&#x201d;<br><br> Jonas&#x2019;s brows went up at the prince&#x2019;s commanding and confident tone. &#x201c;Once <i>we&#x2019;re</i> at sea,&#x201d; he repeated.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes. I&#x2019;m coming with you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re planning to do,&#x201d; Jonas said, crossing his arms. &#x201c;Then you&#x2019;ll explain more <i>now</i>.&#x201d;<br><br> Ashur eyed him. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; <br><br> Jonas eyed him back. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the one who decides who gets on this ship&#x2014;and who doesn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Do you know who I am?&#x201d; Ashur asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Well aware. You&#x2019;re the brother of Amara Cortas, who just recently seems to have made herself the bloodthirsty empress of most of the damn world. And according to Nic, you&#x2019;re supposed to be dead.&#x201d; <br><br> A familiar form appeared behind Ashur, catching Jonas&#x2019;s eye. <br><br> Taran Ranus had left the docks only a few moments ago, so that he might quickly prepare for an unplanned journey to Mytica. But he was already back. As the rebel drew closer, he swiftly pulled out a sword from the sheath at his waist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br> &#x201c;Well, well,&#x201d; Taran said as he raised the tip of the sword to Ashur&#x2019;s throat. &#x201c;Prince Ashur. What a pleasant surprise to see that you&#x2019;ve strolled into our midst this morning, just as my friends are working to topple your family&#x2019;s reign.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The general chaos around the Jewel did give that much away,&#x201d; Ashur said, his tone and demeanor surprisingly serene. <br><br> &#x201c;Why have you come back? Why not stay abroad, chasing after meaningless treasure as everyone says you&#x2019;re fond of doing?&#x201d;<br><br><i> Chasing after treasure?</i> Jonas shared an anxious look with Nic. It seemed that very few were aware that the prince had been presumed dead. <br><br> &#x201c;The circumstances of my return are none of your business.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Are you in Kraeshia because of . . .&#x201d; Nic began, then hesitated. &#x201c;Of . . . what happened to your family? You must know, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, I know.&#x201d; Ashur&#x2019;s expression darkened. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not why I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;<br><br> Taran smirked. &#x201c;As the true heir to the throne, perhaps you&#x2019;ll make an excellent tool for negotiations with your grandmother now that your sister&#x2019;s married the enemy and sailed away.&#x201d;<br><br> Ashur scoffed. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s what you think, then you know nothing about her desire for power&#x2014;or my sister&#x2019;s. It&#x2019;s easy to see that your rebels are vastly outnumbered. This current uprising will be as effective as the chirp of a baby bird in the shadow of a hungry wildcat. What you really need to do is get on this ship and leave while you still have the chance.&#x201d;<br><br> Taran&#x2019;s smirk disappeared. His brown eyes flashed with outrage. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t get to tell me what to do.&#x201d;<br><br> Jonas felt uneasy about Ashur&#x2019;s attitude. He seemed to be taking the recent news of most of his family&#x2019;s massacre in stride. He couldn&#x2019;t tell if Ashur grieved their loss or celebrated it. Or did he feel nothing at all?<br><br> &#x201c;Lower your weapon, Taran,&#x201d; Jonas growled, then hissed out a breath. &#x201c;Why are you back so soon anyway? Didn&#x2019;t you have belongings to gather?&#x201d;<br><br> Taran didn&#x2019;t budge. He kept the sharp tip of his sword pressed to Ashur&#x2019;s throat, his biceps flexing. &#x201c;The roads are blocked. Granny Cortas has decided that all rebels are to be slain on sight. Since we blew up the city dungeon yesterday, there&#x2019;s nowhere to put any prisoners.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All the more reason for us to go now,&#x201d; Nic urged.<br><br> &#x201c;I agree with Nicolo,&#x201d; Ashur said.<br><br> The angry squawk of a bird caught Jonas&#x2019;s attention. He shielded his eyes from the sun and looked up at the golden hawk swooping above the ship. <br><br> Olivia was getting impatient. That made two of them.<br><br> He willed himself to remain calm. He couldn&#x2019;t afford to make any rash decisions. <br><br> Just then, an image of Lysandra slid into his mind, along with the sound of her laughter.&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;No rash decisions? Since when?&#x201d; </i>she would have said.<br><br> <i>Since you died and I couldn&#x2019;t save you.<br></i><br> Pushing his grief away, Jonas forced himself to focus on the prince.<br><br> &#x201c;If you want any chance to board this ship,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;then explain how you&#x2019;ve managed to rise from the dead only to walk right up to a group of rebels like you&#x2019;ve only been out for a tankard of ale.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Rise from the dead?&#x201d; Taran repeated, his furious expression giving way to confusion. <br><br> Ignoring Taran, Jonas searched for any sign of intimidation in the prince&#x2019;s demeanor. A signal that he feared for his life, that he was desperate to escape his homeland. But only serenity filled his pale eyes.<br><br> It was unsettling, really.<br><br> &#x201c;Have you ever heard of the legend of the phoenix?&#x201d; Ashur asked smoothly.<br><br> &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Nic replied. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a mythical bird that rose from the ashes of the flames that originally killed it. It&#x2019;s the symbol for Kraeshia, to show the empire&#x2019;s strength and ability to defy death itself.&#x201d;<br><br> Ashur nodded. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br> Jonas raised his eyebrows. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; he said. <br><br> Nic shrugged. &#x201c;I took a class with Cleo on foreign myths once. I paid more attention than she did.&#x201d; He flicked a wary look at Ashur. &#x201c;What about this legend?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;There is also a legend of a mortal fated to one day do the same&#x2014;return from death to unite the world. Grandmother always believed that my sister would be this phoenix. When Amara was a baby, she died for a brief moment but came back to life, thanks to a resurrection potion our mother gave her. When I recently learned of this, I had the same potion created for me. I&#x2019;m not sure I truly believed it would work, but it did. And as I rose at dawn in the temple where I&#x2019;d died the night before at my sister&#x2019;s hand, I realized the truth.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What truth?&#x201d; Jonas demanded after Ashur fell silent.<br><br> Ashur met his gaze. &#x201c;That <i>I </i>am the phoenix. And it&#x2019;s my destiny to save this world from its current fate, beginning with stopping my sister from her dark need to blindly follow in my father&#x2019;s footsteps.&#x201d;<br><br> The prince fell silent again as his audience of three stared at him. Taran was the first to laugh.<br><br> &#x201c;Royals always think so damn highly of themselves,&#x201d; he sneered. &#x201c;Legends of heroes who defy certain death are as old as legends about the Watchers themselves.&#x201d; Taran glanced at Jonas. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to cut off his head. If he gets up after that, consider me a believer.&#x201d;<br><br> Jonas didn&#x2019;t think Taran was being serious, but he didn&#x2019;t want to take any chances.<br><br> &#x201c;Lower your weapon,&#x201d; Jonas growled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to tell you again.&#x201d;<br><br> Taran cocked his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t take orders from you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Do you want passage on this ship? Then yes, you <i>do</i> take orders from me.&#x201d;<br><br> But still Taran didn&#x2019;t budge, and his gaze grew only more challenging.<br><br> &#x201c;You giving Jonas a problem, Ranus?&#x201d; Felix&#x2019;s voice boomed out, just before he came to stand at Jonas&#x2019;s side. <br><br> Jonas was grateful that Felix Gaebras&#x2014;with all his height and muscles&#x2014;was on his side. A former member of the Clan of the Cobra, a group of assassins who worked for King Gaius, Felix&#x2019;s ability to cast a deadly and intimidating shadow was no accident. <br><br> But Taran was just as deadly and just as intimidating.<br><br> &#x201c;You want to know about my problems?&#x201d; Taran finally lowered his blade to his side, then nodded at the resurrected royal. &#x201c;This is Prince Ashur Cortas.&#x201d; <br><br> Felix peered skeptically at the prince with his good eye. After spending the last week imprisoned and being mercilessly tortured for poisoning the Kraeshian royal family&#x2014;a crime Amara had blamed on him&#x2014;it was his <i>only</i> eye; the other was covered by a black eye patch. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you supposed to be dead?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He is.&#x201d; Nic had stayed very quiet, never taking his attention off of the prince, wearing an expression that was equal parts stunned and confused. <br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d; Ashur spoke patiently to Nic.<br><br> &#x201c;It could be a trick.&#x201d; Nic&#x2019;s brow furrowed in concentration as he studied the prince carefully. &#x201c;Perhaps you&#x2019;re a witch who possesses enough air magic to change your appearance.&#x201d;<br><br> Ashur raised a dark eyebrow, as if amused. &#x201c;Hardly.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Witches are female,&#x201d; Taran reasoned.<br><br> &#x201c;Not always,&#x201d; Ashur replied. &#x201c;There have been a few notable exceptions over the centuries.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Are you trying to help your case or not?&#x201d; Jonas asked sharply.<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s Amara&#x2019;s brother,&#x201d; Felix growled. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just go ahead and kill him and be done with it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Taran seconded. &#x201c;On that, we agree.&#x201d;<br><br> Ashur sighed, and for the first time, there was an edge of impatience in the sound. Despite any threats, he kept his attention firmly on Nic. &#x201c;I understand your hesitation in believing me, Nicolo. It reminds me of your hesitation that night in the City of Gold, when you left the tavern . . . the Beast, I believe it was called. You were drunk, lost, and you looked at me in that alleyway as if I might kill you with the two blades I carried. But I didn&#x2019;t, did I? Do you remember what I did instead?&#x201d;<br><br> Nic&#x2019;s pale face flushed in an instant, and he cleared his throat. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s him,&#x201d; he said quickly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how, but . . . it&#x2019;s him. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br><br> Jonas studied Nic&#x2019;s face, unsure whether to believe such a promise, even from someone he&#x2019;d very recently begun to trust. His gut told him Nic wasn&#x2019;t lying.<br><br> And if Ashur wanted to bring a halt to his sister&#x2019;s evil machinations, believing himself to be this legendary phoenix who&#x2019;d risen from death, true or not, then he could possibly be an asset to their group.<br><br> He wondered what Lys would have to say about<i> this</i> situation. <br><br> No, he already knew. She very likely would have put an arrow through the prince the moment he&#x2019;d appeared.<br><br> The glint of Taran&#x2019;s sword again caught his attention. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t lower that weapon, I&#x2019;m going to have Felix chop off your arm.&#x201d;<br><br> Taran laughed, an unpleasant crack of a sound that cut through the cool morning air. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to see him try.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Would you?&#x201d; Felix asked. &#x201c;My eyesight&#x2019;s not as good as it was, but I think&#x2014;actually, I <i>know</i>&#x2014;I could do it real fast. It might not even hurt.&#x201d; He chuckled darkly as he drew his sword. &#x201c;No, what am I thinking? It&#x2019;s going to hurt very badly. I&#x2019;m no ally to any Cortas, but if Jonas wants the prince to keep breathing, he&#x2019;s going to keep breathing. Got it?&#x201d;<br><br> The two young men glared at each other for several tense moments. Finally Taran sheathed his weapon.<br><br> &#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; he said through clenched teeth. The tight smile on his face didn&#x2019;t match the cold fury in his eyes.<br><br> Without a word, he shoved past Felix and boarded the ship.<br><br> &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Jonas said to Felix under his breath.<br><br> Felix watched Taran&#x2019;s departure with a grim look. &#x201c;You know he&#x2019;s going to be a problem, right?<br><br> &#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Great.&#x201d; Felix glanced at the Limerian ship. &#x201c;By the way, have I mentioned that I get really seasick, especially with the thought of Amara&#x2019;s undead brother on board? So if our new friend Taran tries to cut my throat while I&#x2019;m vomiting off the side of the ship, you&#x2019;re the one I blame.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Understood.&#x201d; Jonas eyed Nic and Ashur warily. &#x201c;Very well, whatever fate awaits us on the other side, let&#x2019;s set sail for Mytica. All of us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Thought you didn&#x2019;t believe in fate?&#x201d; Nic muttered as they made their way up the gangplank.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Jonas said. <br><br> But, to be honest, only a small part of him believed that anymore.</p><h2>You, Your Child, and School: Navigate Your Way to the Best Education</h2><p><b>An essential book for parents to help their children get the education they need to live happy, productive lives from <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Element </i>and <i>Creative Schools<br></i></b><br> Parents everywhere are deeply concerned about the education of their children, especially now, when education has&nbsp;become a minefield of politics and controversy.&nbsp; One of the world&#x2019;s most influential educators, Robinson has had countless conversations with parents about the dilemmas they face.

My aim is to help you get them the education they need to live productive, fulfilled lives. I've worked in education all my professional life. Along the way I've had countless conversations with parents about school. I'm a parent too and know firsthand that being a parent is a challenge as well as a pleasure. It gets more complicated when your children start school. Until then, you've been mainly responsible for their development and well-being. Now you entrust a major chunk of their waking hours to others, giving them enormous influence over your children's lives during their most formative years.<br><br> Seeing them go to school on that first day brings a suite of emotions. You hope they'll be excited about learning, make good friends, and be happy and inspired at school. At the same time, you probably feel a good deal of trepidation. School brings a whole new set of relationships. How will your children respond to their teachers? Will the school see what's special about them? What about the other parents and children? Will your child rise above the new social hurdles or trip over them? As your child heads into school for that first day, it's no wonder you feel a catch in your throat. You think things will never be the same. You're right.<br><br> Emma Robinson (no relation) is a teacher in England. She's also a parent and knows how it feels to leave your child at school on that very first day. She wrote a poem called "Dear Teacher," which has since been shared by thousands of other parents. Here's an extract:<br><br> I know you're rather busy<br><br> First day back, there's just no time<br><br> A whole new class of little ones<br><br> And this one here is mine.<br><br> I'm sure you have things covered<br><br> And have done this lots before<br><br> But my boy is very little<br><br> He hasn't long turned four.<br><br> In his uniform this morning<br><br> He looked so tall and steady<br><br> But now beside your great big school<br><br> I'm not quite sure he's ready.<br><br> It seems like just a blink ago<br><br> I first held him in my arms<br><br> It's been my job to love, to teach<br><br> To keep him safe from harm.<br><br> I know as I give him one more kiss<br><br> And watch him walk away,<br><br> That he'll never again be wholly mine<br><br> As he was before today.<br><br> Parents have always worried about handing their children over, but these days they have even more on their minds about school. Many are exasperated about what's happening in education. They worry that there's far too much testing and stress at school. They feel that the curriculum has become too narrow because of cuts in important programs in the arts, sports, and outdoor activities. They're concerned that their children are not treated as individuals and that schools are failing to cultivate their curiosity, creativity, and personal talents. They're anxious about how many young people are being diagnosed with learning problems and being medicated to keep them focused. They worry about potential bullying and harassment. If they have children in high school, they worry about the rising costs of college and whether their children will be able to find a job whether they go to college or not. More than that, they often feel powerless as parents to do anything about it.<br><br> Anger and Anxiety<br><br> Recently, I asked people on Twitter and Facebook about their biggest concerns in educating their children. In less than an hour, hundreds of people from all over the world had posted responses. Bec, a young mother in the United States, spoke for many when she said that children's "strengths are not valued and their weaknesses are magnified. Their grades are more important than their sense of self." Kimmie, another mom, asked, "Will my children discover their true potential and be guided to a career that they love and are passionate about." Conchita wrote, "I have all sorts of worries about my two daughters. I feel the current system will not let them shine and my ten-year-old may not get what she needs to overcome her learning difficulties and anxiety."<br><br> Jon is worried that children "are gradually being taught to not enjoy learning: that it's somehow an arduous rite of passage we're all forced to go through with no solid reasoning. It's a constant battle to keep that spark of curiosity and delight about learning alive when the system packages it and sets narratives about education the way it does." Karin said, "Education is broken. There's too much pressure, too many tests, too many demands, too much assembly line. How can we reboot? How can we prepare our kids for a radically different life from the one the current system prepares them for?"<br><br> Carol was concerned that the "one-size-fits-all approach, orchestrated by individuals that have no business dictating educational policy, is producing students who have no ability to think for themselves and an absolute fear of failure." Another mother's top concern was whether schools "are teaching kids to be creative problem solvers. Testing doesn't teach kids to be versatile thinkers." Tracey points to a deep worry for many parents: "I'm most concerned with the fact that policy makers seem to have little regard for parent voices. The culture around parent voices is dismissive at best and those who make decisions about kids haven't a clue what actually goes on in classrooms." These are all legitimate anxieties and if you share them, you're right to be worried.<br><br> Education is sometimes thought of as a preparation for what happens when your child leaves school-getting a good job or going on to higher education. There's a sense in which that's true, but childhood is not a rehearsal. Your children are living their lives now with their own feelings, thoughts, and relationships. Education has to engage with them in the here and now, just as you do as a parent. Who your children become and what they go on to do in the future has everything to do with the experiences they have in the present. If your children have a narrow education, they may not discover the talents and interests that could enrich their lives in the present and inspire their futures beyond school.<br><br> How Can This Book Help?<br><br> So how can this book help you? I hope it will be useful in three ways. The first is by looking at the sort of education your children need these days and how it relates to your roles as a parent. Parents often think their children need the same sort of education they had themselves. It depends on what sort of education they did have, but in general that's probably not true. The world is changing so quickly now that education has to change too. The second is by looking at the challenges you face in helping them get that education. Some of those challenges have to do with public policies for education and some more generally with the times we live in. The third is by looking at your options and power as a parent to overcome these challenges. Let me enter some caveats right away.<br><br> To begin with, this is not a manual on how to be a good parent. I wouldn't have the nerve. I'm sure this comes as a relief, because seemingly everyone else does. From Dr. Spock to the Tiger Moms, you already face a fire hose of advice on how to raise your children. Apart from the unsought advice of friends, relatives, and probably your children too about how to be a better parent, there are more than four million mom blogs on the Internet, and the online bookstores list more than one hundred fifty thousand books in their parenting categories. I don't want to add to the clamor.<br><br> My wife and I have two grown children and many relatives and friends with children of their own. We've been through many of the challenges we discuss in this book. So has my writing partner, Lou Aronica, who has a large family of his own. We know that the pressures on parents never ease up. You're going to be worrying about your children and trying to help them navigate through their lives forever. Parenting is a lifetime assignment. It can be hard work at times, and the hours are dreadful. Consider this book to be a respite from some of that pressure. We're not living in some lofty alternate reality where everyone is having a better time than you. I do want to suggest some principles of parenting that are relevant to education and are widely supported by research and experience. In doing that, let me assure you that I'm here on the ground with you, and the advice I'm offering comes from the perspective of those who have missed the mark on more than one occasion.<br><br> This is not a good-schools guide either. I'm often asked about specific schools or systems and whether I'd recommend them. All schools are different. There are great and poor public schools, and great and poor charter, private, and alternative schools too. My answer is always to go and see the place for yourself and get a sense of whether it would work for you and your child. To do that, you do need some sense of what counts as a good school, and that's what we will be looking at.<br><br> I'm not suggesting a one-size-fits-all solution. On the contrary, no two children are the same and yours are no different, as it were. Your parenting choices and priorities are naturally affected by your own background and circumstances. If you're a single parent living in a poor neighborhood, your choices are different from someone with paid help living in a wealthy suburb. You may be in a position to choose the school you want for your child. Most parents are not. So you just have to play the hand you are dealt, right? Actually, no. You do have choices and we'll be looking at what they are.<br><br> Overall, my aim is to offer some advice on what counts as a good education and what you can do as a parent to make sure your children get one. That includes how to support them through the current education system, or outside it if you choose. These are some of the options available to all parents.<br><br> You can enroll your child at the local school and leave the school to it.<br><br> You can become active in your child's education by building relationships with his or her teachers and through the support you provide at home.<br><br> You can become more involved in the general life of the school.<br><br> You can influence school policy making through the local school board.<br><br> You can campaign for change with other parents.<br><br> You can look for another school.<br><br> You can homeschool or unschool your child.<br><br> You can use online learning opportunities.<br><br> If you do have a choice of schools, which one should you choose and why? If you don't, what should you expect from the school you have, and what can you do if it falls short? Deciding which way to go depends on several themes, which we'll look at in the chapters that follow. The first theme is your roles as a parent in general and how they relate to education. The second theme is the overall development of your children from birth to early adulthood. It's important to have a sense of this so you know the sorts of experiences you and the school should offer your child and why. The third theme is the importance of recognizing the talents, interests, and character of your own child. The fourth theme is why the education your children need now may be different from when you were at school. The fifth theme is why so many schools are not yet providing that sort of education and what you can do as a parent to change that.<br><br> Learning, Education, and School<br><br> Before we get into this, let me distinguish three terms, which will keep coming up: learning, education, and school.<br><br> Learning is acquiring new skills and understanding.<br><br> Education is an organized program of learning.<br><br> School is a community of learners.<br><br> Children love to learn; they don't always enjoy education and some have big problems with school. Why is that?<br><br> Learning is natural for children. Babies learn at a prodigious pace. Take language. In their first twenty-four months or so, they go from being inarticulate bundles of cries and gurgles to being able to speak. It's a remarkable achievement and nobody, including you, "teaches" your child how to do it. You don't because you couldn't. Learning to speak is far too complicated. How do babies learn to speak? They have a natural capacity for it and they love to learn. How do they do it? By listening and by copying you and the others around them. You encourage them with your smiles and delight, and they encourage you with theirs. They learn to speak because they want to and they can. As they go through life, they'll pick up all sorts of other skills and knowledge just for the love of learning: because they want to and they can.<br><br> Education is a more organized approach to learning. It can be formal or informal, self-directed or organized by someone else. It might be at home, online, at work, or somewhere else. Peter Gray is a research professor of psychology at Boston College and author of Free to Learn. Children, he says, "are beautifully designed, by nature, to direct their own education. For most of human history, children educated themselves through observing, exploring, questioning, playing and participating. These educative instincts still work beautifully for children who are provided with conditions that allow them to flourish."<br><br> A school is any community of people who come together to learn with and from each other. I was asked recently if I thought schools are still a good idea. I do, and the reason is that most of what we learn in our lives, we learn with and from other people. Learning is as much a social as an individual process. The real question is what sort of schools help children learn best? Many young people are turned off education not because they don't want to learn but because the rituals and routines of conventional schooling get in the way.<br><br> For most of us, our main experience of formal education is grade school. What images does "school" bring to mind? If you think "high school," you may picture long corridors and lockers, classrooms full of desks with blackboards or whiteboards at the front, a hall with a stage, a gym, science labs, maybe a music room or art studio and a sports field somewhere. What about what goes on there? You may think of separate subjects (some more important than others), fixed schedules, bells and buzzers, students streaming between rooms in age groups, assignments, tests, and after-school programs. What about preschool or elementary school? Whatever your own feelings about school, the fact is that if you passed out somewhere and woke up in one, you'd probably work out quickly where you were. Since the introduction of mass education in the nineteenth century, schools have become recognizable places that work in typical ways. Many of the rituals of schools are taken for granted largely because school has been like this for a long time. Not all schools are like this, and schools don't have to be this way at all. The fact that so many are is a matter of habit, not necessity. We'll be looking at different ways of doing school and at how the best schools create conditions in which young people enjoy learning and want to achieve at their highest levels. It's important that they do enjoy education, for them and for you.</p><h2>The Doorstop Book: The Encyclopedia of Doorstop Collecting (Schiffer Book for Collectors)</h2><p>As long as there have been doors there have been doorstops. Early on they may have been a convenient rock or piece of furniture, but in the 19th and early 20th centuries, doorstops were manufactured as decorative items for the home. Generally cast in iron, they are avidly sought after by today's collectors. Though mass produced, they were usually painted by hand and so each has become a unique treasure, appreciated both for its shape and the "folk art" quality of its finish. This wonderful new book brings together over 1,000 doorstops photographed in full color and organized by categories: flowers, birds, animals, wagons, Native Americans, people, houses &amp; windmills, and nautical. It includes an informative history of doorstops, valuable information for collectors, histories and marks of the foundries that made them and more.

This time, Tibbett and his cheerful wife, Emmy, are lazing on a friend's yacht, tacking from one little English sea-town to the next, and it should all be delicious indolence...except that Henry can't stop thinking about death. Well, one death in particular. The death of a local sailor. And he especially can't stop thinking about it when it starts looking as though the drowned sailor is somehow connected to the robbery at a nearby manor-house. As with so many of the books in this series, much of the pleasure lies in the setting's timelessness: It's officially 1961 for <em>The Sunken Sailor</em>, but in Berrybridge Haven, and on England's peaceful waterways, it is time out of mind.</p><p>Patricia Moyes (1923-2000) was a British mystery writer best known for her &#x201c;Henry Tibbet&#x201d; series of old-fashioned mysteries.

After a spell of homelessness, he finds a job in the kitchen of a posh restaurant and a room in the house of an appealing Irishman who has already lost his family. Never mind that Lev must sleep in a bunk bed surrounded by plastic toys--he has found a friend and shelter. However constricted his life in England remains, he compensates by daydreaming of home, by having an affair with a younger restaurant worker, and by trading gossip and ambitions via cell phone with his hilarious friend Rudi, who, dreaming of the wealthy West, lives largely for his battered Chevrolet.<br><br>Homesickness dogs Lev, not only for nostalgic reasons, but because he doesn't belong, body or soul, to his new country--but can he really go home again?

Tremain&#39;s protagonist, Lev, emigrating from an Eastern Bloc country to work in the UK, speaks with a Slavic accent. In his homesick struggles to survive in a foreign culture completely different from his expectations, he meets people with Qatari, Irish, posh-Brit, old-lady, drunk-man, Chinese, Cockney, and young-girl voices. Stevenson renders each so impeccably, and makes them so distinct in timbre and personality as well as accent, that you utterly lose track of the fact that it&#39;s all created by one actor. Most of all, she delivers a moving story of one immigrant who occasionally does unwise or dopey things but never loses our interest or sympathy. Cause for celebration. B.G.

He served most recently as a senior agent in the FBI, with 20 years of experience. He was, until recently, the head of the Counterintelligence Behavioral Analysis Program, where his primary mission was to thwart the efforts of foreign spies, and to recruit American spies. His core approach in this mission was to inspire reasonable, well-founded trust among people who could provide valuable information.</p><p><i>The Code of Trust</i> is based on the system Dreeke devised, tested, and implemented during years of field work at the highest levels of national security. Applying his system first to himself, he rose up through federal law enforcement, and then taught his system to law enforcement and military officials throughout the country, and later to private sector clients. <i>The Code of Trust </i>has since elevated executives to leadership, and changed the culture of entire companies, making them happier and more productive, as morale soared.</p><p>Inspiring trust is not a trick, nor is it an arcane art. It&#x2019;s an important, character-building endeavor that requires only a sincere desire to be helpful and sensitive, and the ambition to be more successful at work and at home. <i>The Code of Trust</i> is based on 5 simple principles:</p><p>1) Suspend Your Ego<br> 2) Be Nonjudgmental<br> 3) Honor Reason<br> 4) Validate Others<br> 5) Be Generous</p><p>To be successful with this system, a reader needs only the willingness to spend eight to ten hours learning a method of trust-building that took Robin Dreeke almost a lifetime to create.</p></p><p><p>ROBIN DREEKE entered federal law enforcement in 1997, after graduating from the US Naval Academy and serving in the US Marine Corps. He received advanced training and operational experience in social psychology and in the practical application of the science of relationship development. Eventually he rose to direct the behavioral analysis program in a federal law enforcement agency. Dreeke is currently an agent of the FBI and lives in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

His real world examples in stressful situations offer an engaging backdrop to learn about human nature." &#x2015;Shane Parrish, publisher of the renown Farnam Street blog</p></p><h2>Time and the Town: A Provincetown Chronicle</h2><p>Time and the Town was the last of Mary Heaton Vorse's books. It is about many things--a town and its people, the author, a certain kind of idyllic life. As much as anything else, it is the biography of the house Vorse bought in 1907 and lived in, off and on, for the next thirty-six years. The moods of the house mirrored her own. "Our houses," she wrote, "are our biographies, the stories of our defeats and victories."<br><br> Tinged with nostalgia and disenchantment, the book describes a Provincetown that has changed, a place on the verge of modernity. It is no longer a major fishing port. It has become a place whose business is tourism. Contrasting the old and the new, Vorse celebrates the enduring character of the town itself. She tells stories that are engaging and charming, droll and fabulous. The wrinkled Mrs. Mary Mooncusser who, though drunk and stark naked, conducts herself with great decorum when Vorse pays her a call, might have stepped out of the pages of Sherwood Anderson or Eudora Welty. In another anecdote, the townspeople scour the beaches for cases of booze dumped into the sea by rumrunners and are briefly inflated with the spirit of ancestral smugglers and buccaneers.<br><br> Vorse herself remained something of an outsider in Provincetown, despite her evident affection for the place and its inhabitants. They surely regarded her as simply another of those artist-intellectuals--many of whom appear in the pages of this book. The "off-Cape" outsiders put the town in the national limelight but took no interest in local matters. Vorse here ponders local matters exclusively, almost, one suspects, as a way of forgetting the more complex matters that occupied her--her agonies of parental guilt, her resentment of domestic obligations, her third marriage, her depressions and breakdowns. The town is in that sense beyond time.<br> &nbsp;</p><p></p><h2>The Terrorism Trap: September 11 and Beyond</h2><p><p><em>The Terrorism Trap</em> is a powerfully argued analysis of the deeper causes and meaning of September 11. Why did the attacks happen? Who is to blame? Who is taking advantage of the crisis? Who is hurt by all the ensuing events? Why do they hate us? Responding to such questions, Michael Parenti probes the religious zealotry of today, Afghanistan's hidden history, and the course of US-led globalization that has impoverished and angered much of the world. This acute dissection of the political, economic and religious forces behind the attacks provides historical perspective and insight into how to prevent future terrorism and save democracy.</p><p>" . . . it is a thorough explanations of [Parenti's] views on the political and economic tangle that has linked US business interest to the kind of animosity that fuels terrorist attacks; an interest that, rather than being squelched or even crippled, has exploited the weaknesses of a national and global economy severely shocked by the attacks."&#x2014;Corey O'Malley, <em>Friction Magazine</em></p><p>"It should be required reading for anyone who believes in a true democracy rather than a corporate state and/or a security state. Parenti emphasizes the need for a change in U.S. policy as it relates to the world free market, which has become a metaphor for the obscene differences in income for 'the haves and have nots.' Driven by a love of democracy and a passion for the truth, Parenti strips naked the secretive machinations of the U.S. government leaders that give little regard to people throughout the world."&#x2014;Alex Vavoulis, <em>Community Alliance</em>.</p><p>Michael Parenti is one of the nation's most astute political analysts.

Michael Parenti dissects the religious, political, and economic forces behind the attacks, putting them in proper historical perspective, which includes an understanding of Afghanistan&#39;s hidden history. He answers such questions as: why did September 11 happen? who is to be blamed? who is taking advantage of the crisis? who is hurt by all the ensuing events? And why do they hate us? He sees the religious terrorism of today as related to a long-standing religious tradition of violence as well as being a reaction to a US-led globalization process that has impoverished and angered much of the world.

This lavishly illustrated book explains the development of space stations from the earliest fictional visions through historical and current programs--including Skylab, Mir, and the International Space Station--and on to the dawning possibilities of large-scale space colonization. Engrossing narrative and striking images explore not only the spacecraft themselves but also how humans experience life aboard them, addressing everything from the development of efficient meal preparation methods to experiments in space-based botany. The book examines cutting-edge developments in government and commercial space stations, including NASA's Deep Space Habitats, the Russian Orbital Technologies Commercial Space Station, and China's Tiangong program. Throughout, <i>Space Stations</i> also charts the fascinating depiction of space stations in popular culture, whether in the form of children's toys, comic-book spacecraft, settings in science-fiction novels, or the backdrop to TV series and Hollywood movies. <i>Space Stations </i>is a beautiful and captivating history of the idea and the reality of the space station from the nineteenth century to the present day.</p><p>GARY KITMACHER is the mission manager for education and outreach at the Johnson Space Center.

After describing early cosmology, the authors move through the first theoretical and fictional descriptions of permanent space-based structures, the early days of space travel, the first working stations, and a longer look at the International Space Station. A section on space stations&#x2019; depiction in pop culture, from German author Karl Laffert&#x2019;s 1926 novel about a &#x201c;Weltraumstation&#x201d; to <i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</i>, provides an intriguing perspective, and the authors finish with the possible implications for humanity, such as outposts like the ISS becoming &#x201c;the means by which we leave our planet behind and find new places to live.&#x201d; The layout is visually appealing, with plentiful drawings, diagrams, and photos to aid understanding. The physics and early historical background are at times rushed and repetitive, but the technical descriptions are unimpeachable and wonderfully complemented by accounts of the minutiae of everyday life in space. The authors have created an information-packed starting point perfect for anyone interested in space stations, but unsure where to begin. 400 color illus.<br><br><i><b>BOOKLIST</b></i><br>Although NASA scientists are still a long way from constructing a version of the iconic wheel-shaped space station in 2001: A Space Odyssey, since 1971, several well-designed research stations have successfully made it into orbit, from the ill-fated Skylab, which famously fell to earth after only six years, to the still operational International Space Station (ISS), launched in 1998. Weaving together history, popular culture, and aeronautical engineering details, Johnson Space Center consultant Kitmacher joins space memorabilia expert Pearlman and science fiction illustrator Miller in presenting a beautifully illustrated guide to these spectacular orbiting edifices from the past, present, and future. In seven richly informative sections, the authors look at the visionary prehistory of space stations, such as nineteenth century author Edward Everett Hale&#x2019;s bizarre &#x201c;brick moon,&#x201d; survey the challenges behind building the Soviet Mir and ISS stations, and flash forward to images of futuristic space colonies. Covering technical breakthroughs as well as Star Trek and comic book references, their work will win high marks from space buffs and sf fans alike.</p><h2>Covered Wagon Women, Volume 4: Diaries and Letters from the Western Trails, 1852: The California Trail</h2><p>In 1852 a record number of women helped keep the wagons rolling over the perilous western trails.

The bitter four-month struggle that ensued-known as the Hundred Days Campaign-saw some of the bloodiest and most ferocious combat of the Great War, as the Allies grimly worked to break the stalemate in the west and end the conflict that had decimated Europe.<br><br>In <i>Hundred Days</i>, acclaimed military historian Nick Lloyd leads readers into the endgame of World War I, showing how the timely arrival of American men and materiel-as well as the bravery of French, British, and Commonwealth soldiers-helped to turn the tide on the Western Front. Many of these battle-hardened troops had endured years of terror in the trenches, clinging to their resolve through poison-gas attacks and fruitless assaults across no man's land. Finally, in July 1918, they and their American allies did the impossible: they returned movement to the western theater. Using surprise attacks, innovative artillery tactics, and swarms of tanks and aircraft, they pushed the Germans out of their trenches and forced them back to their final bastion: the Hindenburg Line, a formidable network of dugouts, barbed wire, and pillboxes. After a massive assault, the Allies broke through, racing toward the Rhine and forcing Kaiser Wilhelm II to sue for peace.<br><br>An epic tale ranging from the ravaged fields of Flanders to the revolutionary streets of Berlin, <i>Hundred Days</i> recalls the bravery and sacrifice that finally silenced the guns of Europe.<br></p><p><b>Nick Lloyd</b> is Senior Lecturer in Defense Studies at King's College London.

Our notion of the self, intimately dependent as it is on our response to the excretions and secretions of our bodies, depends on it. Cultural identities have frequent recourse to its boundary-policing powers. Love depends on overcoming it, while the pleasure of sex comes in large measure from the titillating violation of disgust prohibitions. Imagine aesthetics without disgust for tastelessness and vulgarity; imagine morality without disgust for evil, hypocrisy, stupidity, and cruelty.</p><p>Miller details our anxious relation to basic life processes: eating, excreting, fornicating, decaying, and dying. But disgust pushes beyond the flesh to vivify the larger social order with the idiom it commandeers from the sights, smells, tastes, feels, and sounds of fleshly physicality. Disgust and contempt, Miller argues, play crucial political roles in creating and maintaining social hierarchy. Democracy depends less on respect for persons than on an equal distribution of contempt. Disgust, however, signals dangerous division. The high's belief that the low actually smell bad, or are sources of pollution, seriously threatens democracy.</p><p>Miller argues that disgust is deeply grounded in our ambivalence to life: it distresses us that the fair is so fragile, so easily reduced to foulness, and that the foul may seem more than passing fair in certain slants of light. When we are disgusted, we are attempting to set bounds, to keep chaos at bay. Of course we fail. But, as Miller points out, our failure is hardly an occasion for despair, for disgust also helps to animate the world, and to make it a dangerous, magical, and exciting place.</p></p><p>The title of William Ian Miller's book is a play on Robert Burton's 17th-century classic <i>The Anatomy of Melancholy,</i> an examination of human emotion. In his modern <i>Anatomy</i>, Miller narrows the focus to the function of disgust in human life. Disgust, Miller posits, is a kind of protection; just as fear causes us to flee danger or loyalty prompts us to support one another, disgust draws boundaries and insulates the individual from outside incursions--anything from the unhygienic hair in our soup to the frightening explosion of homelessness in our cities. Among his theories is one that democracy depends on the even distribution of disgust across class lines. <p> Mr. Miller is not afraid to explore the darker side of disgust as well--the fact that we may feel it in conjunction with contempt toward people, objects, or concepts that do not warrant it. Nevertheless, disgust serves an important role in humanity's complex emotional and social makeup, and <i>The Anatomy of Disgust</i> is novel in its approach to uncovering just what that role might be.</p>William Miller details our anxious relation to basic life processes; eating, excreting, fornicating, decaying, and dying.

Viewed largely as a confrontation between democracy and fascism, the resulting civil war proved to be of enormous international significance. Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy intervened to assist General Franco, while the Soviet Union came to the aid of the Republican forces.

In his 1992 book, <i>The Playboy</i>, he explored his personal history with pornography. His bestselling 2003 graphic novel, <i>Louis Riel</i>, was a biographical examination of an extreme political figure. The book won wide acclaim and cemented Brown's reputation as a true innovator. </p><p><i>Paying for It </i>is a natural progression for Brown as it combines the personal and sexual aspects of his autobiographical work with the polemical drive of <i>Louis Riel</i>. Brown calmly lays out the facts of how he became not only a willing participant in but a vocal proponent of one of the world's most hot-button topics&#x2015;prostitution. While this may appear overly sensational and just plain implausible to some, Brown's story stands for itself. <i>Paying for It </i>offers an entirely contemporary exploration of sex work&#x2015;from the timid john who rides his bike to his escorts, wonders how to tip so as not to offend, and reads Dan Savage for advice, to the modern-day transactions complete with online reviews, seemingly willing participants, and clean apartments devoid of clich�d street corners, drugs, or pimps. </p><p>Complete with a surprise ending, <i>Paying for It </i>provides endless debate and conversation about sex work and will be the most talkedabout graphic novel of 2011.</p></p><p><p><b>Chester Brown</b> lives in Toronto, where he ran for Parliament in the general election as a member of the Libertarian Party of Canada.</p>A compelling look into one man's history of employing prostitutes as a replacement for romantic love, this graphic novel is sure to create controversy. Brown has produced acclaimed but brutally honest autobiographical works before, but here he adds a new didactic element. In June 1996 Brown's then girlfriend broke up with him. After three years of celibacy and his growing conviction that romantic love is destructively possessive, Brown works up the courage to see a legal prostitute and finds the "burden" of anxiety over whether to pursue a relationship with any particular woman forever removed. The next 200 pages are an explicit&#x2014;but far from erotic&#x2014;dossier of the various women he did business with, until he meets one that he ends up with in a monogamous&#x2014;but still financial&#x2014;relationship. Although Brown intends the work to be a compassionate look at a profession that helps people, he unfortunately goes out of his way to anonymize the sex workers&#x2014;never showing their faces and telling the story in tiny, cramped panels, giving the whole thing a voyeuristic feel. A lengthy appendix arguing that a system where paying for sex is preferable to romance-based methods is unlikely to persuade many readers. (May) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

The Ho 229 was planned as the first of the next generation of German jet fighters to follow on from the Messerschmitt Me 262. The intention was to create a high-speed cannon-equipped fighterbomber and reconnaissance aircraft. The aircraft, which saw figures such as Goering, Galland and Lippish involved in its development, commenced flight-testing in December 1944 and it was planned to re-equip the Me 163-equipped JG 400 with the Ho 229 later in the war.<p>This book charts in detail the development and operational record of the Horten Ho 229. One of the prototypes, V3, survives in the USA and the book includes specially commissioned photographs of this survivor.

Spanning a period of over 30 years (1951-1983) this book draws on Thesiger's original diaries of his various journeys and his vivid memories of them, and includes some 80 or so previously unpublished photographs of the stunning mountain scenery he saw and the people he encountered.</p><p>"I felt an uplift of the spirit. Never had I seen such country." This was Wilfred Thesiger's reaction when he first laid eyes on the snow-capped mountain ranges of Iraqi Kurdistan. The celebrated British explorer had always been drawn to mountains, and, over the course of thirty years, he fulfilled his dream of traveling the awesome ranges of the Karakorams, the Hindu Kush, and Ladakh. Drawing on his unpublished diaries, Thesiger brilliantly documents the hardships, dangers, and rewards of mountain travel. Each of his journeys has a singular quality, captured in some of the finest photos he has ever taken--images of startling beauty, many of which are reproduced here for the first time.

Here, Jacques Ranci�re brings a new and highly useful set of terms to the vexed debate about political effectiveness and &#x201c;the end of politics.&#x201d;</p><p>What precisely is at stake in the relationship between &#x201c;philosophy&#x201d; and the adjective &#x201c;political&#x201d;? In<i>&nbsp;Disagreement</i>, Ranci�re explores the apparent contradiction between these terms and reveals the uneasy meaning of their union in the phrase &#x201c;political philosophy&#x201d;&#x2014;a juncture related to age-old attempts in philosophy to answer Plato&#x2019;s devaluing of politics as a &#x201c;democratic egalitarian&#x201d; process.</p><p>According to Ranci�re, the phrase also expresses the paradox of politics itself: the absence of a proper foundation. Politics, he argues, begins when the &#x201c;demos&#x201d; (the &#x201c;excessive&#x201d; or unrepresented part of society) seeks to disrupt the order of domination and distribution of goods &#x201c;naturalized&#x201d; by police and legal institutions. In addition, the notion of &#x201c;equality&#x201d; operates as a game of contestation that constantly substitutes litigation for political action and community. This game, Ranci�re maintains, operates by a primary logic of &#x201c;misunderstanding.&#x201d; In turn, political philosophy has always tried to substitute the &#x201c;politics of truth&#x201d; for the politics of appearances.</p><p><i>Disagreement</i>&nbsp;investigates the various transformations of this regime of &#x201c;truth&#x201d; and their effects on practical politics. Ranci�re then distinguishes what we mean by &#x201c;democracy&#x201d; from the practices of a consensual system in order to unravel the ramifications of the fashionable phrase &#x201c;the end of politics.&#x201d; His conclusions will be of interest to readers concerned with political questions from the broadest to the most specific and local.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Death at Windsor Castle: Her Majesty Investigates</h2><p>Housemaid Jane Bee's summer duties run to dusting the props for a week of pageantry at Windsor Castle, the Queen's favorite haunt. But the Investiture of the new Knights of the Garter ends up combining pomp with a extremely unpleasant circumstance.... Mild-mannered art curator Roger Pettibon is found dead, a ceremonial sword in his back and a Royal Garter around his knee.<br><br>The police are quick to arrest moody Court painter Victor Fabiani, at work on a portrait of the regal face that launched a billion postage stamps. But Fabiani's confession--despite its story of art forgery and blackmail--doesn't ring true to Jane. Nor to Her Majesty, who dispatches her on a discreet inquiry among the cream of society gathered for the Ascot races. And, as Jane traces the twisty lineage of more than one family, Windsor's ancient battlements witness a second death--and their second ordeal in five years, by fire and water....</p><p>Industrious housemaid Jane Bee is at it again in this third novel in a series featuring Her Majesty the Queen as a very polite inquisitor in deaths that are not what they seem in the various royal houses. C.C. Benison has set up the novels so that Jane Bee, a Canadian college student working for the royal family as a lark, ostensibly serves as Watson to the Queen's Sherlock. However, Jane is much quicker off the mark than Watson ever was, and the Queen, old dear that she is, is not quite as prescient as Holmes; yet, the Font of All Justice is just as believably steely-eyed in the pursuit of truth. <p> In this instance, Ascot Week at Windsor provides the setting, and Jane sets out to find who was rude enough to slaughter royal curator Roger Pettibon in the Throne Room of Windsor Castle. Strawberries, glamorous hats, and Eton schoolboys all play a role in helping Jane solve the crime. Benison's strength is her ear for Britspeak and the occasional hilarious aside in how the English amuse themselves with the summer onslaught of foreign tourists. (The Queen's footman, whose primary responsibility is looking after the Corgis, admits to one heat-flushed Southerner that a footman, of course, takes care of the royal family's feet.) At times, though, Jane has the grace of a bull in a china shop, or, more accurately, a North American abroad. And, Benison could make better use of minor characters, such as the chip-slinging single mother whose daughter gives Jane the clue she needs to solve the crime. They are often whisked away before the reader can appreciate their subtleties or contradictions. Still, Benison's efforts are solid enough and <i>Death at Windsor Palace</i> makes a nice addition to her series. <i>--K.A. Crouch</i></p><b>C. C.

But they&#x2019;re not the only ones with vocations&#x2015;or calls&#x2015;from God. Lay people, too, are called to serve God, and in this book, Edward S. Little invites us to recognize &#x2013; and respond &#x2013; to our own unique vocations.</p> <p><em>Ears to Hear </em>takes readers on a journey through the Old Testament, showing the way God called ordinary people to service, and drawing parallels for ordinary people in the twenty-first century. The story of Abraham, who was called away from his homeland with no clear destination, exemplifies the insecurity of modern-day readers who may be called to abandon the security of their homes or their jobs to do God&#x2019;s will. The story of Moses, who was armed with a list of serious&#x2015;and logical&#x2015;objections to God&#x2019;s call, is a lesson for contemporary readers faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles to their vocations. In each of these stories, Little shows that God&#x2019;s call&#x2015;in Old Testament days and now&#x2015;is always accompanied with more than enough grace to answer it.</p> <p>Each chapter concludes with a set of discussion questions, making this an ideal book not only for individuals discerning God&#x2019;s call, but also for parish study groups.</p></p><p>Edward S.

Rosenblum's history of this one strike reveals to us, in chapter and verse, the barbaric use of power by the corporate big boys. It is a stunning metaphor for labor's trouble today."&#x2015;Studs Terkel (from a review of the first edition)</p><p>"Rosenblum writes with the verve of a good journalist and the empirical precision of a fine scholar. He is as deft at sketching brief portraits of key executives, union officials, and rank-and-file strikers as he is at untangling the legal skein in which the miners got fatally ensnared."&#x2015;Michael Kazin, New York Times Book Review (from a review of the first edition)</p><p>In this new edition, Jonathan D. Rosenblum describes the resurgence in 1996 and 1997 of union activism at Local 890 in Silver City, New Mexico, the famous "Salt of the Earth" union. Phelps Dodge obliterated all the unions at its Arizona properties in the devastating 1983 campaign of permanent replacement documented in Copper Crucible. The company later acquired the Chino mine in western New Mexico; with the copper ore came the elements of union rebirth. When Phelps Dodge officials argued that "while unions may have had a purpose in the past, that time is gone," they rekindled the union's fighting spirit, according to Rosenblum. Local 890 beat back Phelps Dodge's 1996 decertification campaign, handing the company its first major setback against unions in fifteen years.</p></p><p><p>Jonathan D. Rosenblum practices law in Madison, Wisconsin.</p>The 1981 firing and replacing of striking air traffic controllers by President Ronald Reagan is considered the start of labor's current decline. Legal protection of employees' right to join unions is now often ineffective and the strike, once labor's most potent weapon, has been defanged by employers who use permanent replacements for striking workers. In his first book, lawyer and journalist Rosenblum argues convincingly that the crucial struggle over permanent replacements came not with PATCO (Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization) but in the lesser-known 1983-1986 strike by the United Steelworkers of America against the Phelps Dodge copper company in Arizona and Texas. There, the company moved quickly to hire replacements. Over a year later, after picket-line violence (including a National Guard call-up by Governor Bruce Babbitt), much human tragedy, religious, racial and ethnic divisions among Phelps Dodge workers, an abortive union-sponsored corporate campaign and a lingering recession, replacement workers were legally allowed to vote the union out. And, with help from Phelps Dodge and an employer-friendly federal labor official, they did. Rosenblum chronicles this story with compassion and considerable objectivity. He portrays the strikers sympathetically but not uncritically, and his portrait of Phelps Dodge details the cooly self-interested executive decision-making processes, devoid of compassion for the employees. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Literary Chickens</h2><p><strong>From the best-selling photographer of <em>Ancient Trees</em>, an arresting collection of black-and-white chicken portraits paired with quotations from classic literature</strong><br><br>Fierce, funny, and flamboyant, fifty-two heritage-breed chickens assess the camera with a keen gaze.

Unlike his well-loved Persian Letters, The Spirit of Laws scandalized the French-it was even banned by the Roman Catholic Church. The fact that it is hardly dated to modern readers is a testament to how revolutionary it must have seemed 250 years ago. Among its comparisons of different forms of governments, such as monarchies, despotic regimes, and republics, is the now-famous section on Montesquieu&#39;s concept of the separation of powers, dividing the ruling body into legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Also included is the author&#39;s thinking on slavery, religion in government, families and censuses, the influence of climate on politics and culture, and the making of laws. A powerful influence on the framers of the U.S. Constitution, this classic work will appeal to history buffs and anyone interested in the roots of modern political theory and government. CHARLES-LOUIS DE SECONDAT, BARON DE MONTESQUIEU (1689-1755), born in the South of France and often known simply as Montesquieu, was a political philosopher and social commentator known for his influential political views, especially for his &#34;separation of power&#34; theory, still used today in constitutions around the world. Some of his best-known work, the satirical Persian Letters, which made fun of life in Paris under Louis XIV, delighted France in the 1720s.</p><p><p><strong>Baron de Montesquieu </strong>(1689-1755) was a French jurist, satirist, and political and social philosopher during the Enlightenment.

Now Slocum lay facedown in the dirt, as dead as he would ever be. <br>Bannister was known locally as a horse trader, .nding them in faraway places and bringing them to the West Texas hill country for sale. He could recognize a good horse as far as he could see it, and spot a blemish from .fty yards. He loved horses as other men might love a woman. The blue roan, he thought, was one of the best he had ever owned. <br>The four Slocum brothers&#x2014; three now that Cletus was gone&#x2014; also had a reputation for knowing good horses, stealing them when and where they could. They had gone unpunished because law of.cers had not been able to bring a strong case to court. It was dif.cult to persuade a witness to testify against one of them, knowing that to do so was to invite an unfriendly visit by the other three. <br>Bannister did not wait for the law to act. He pursued Cletus across the rockiest ground along the South Llano River. He caught up with him when the roan stumbled and went down, breaking a foreleg. While witness Willy Pegg trembled and begged for his own life, Bannister put an end to Cletus&#x2019;s dubious career. He felt no remorse over the man, but his heart was heavy with pain when he shot the crippled roan. <br>Riding back to Junction, he stopped at a modest frame house he shared with his wife Geneva. While he hastily gathered a few necessities for travel, he told her, &#x201c;I just killed Cletus Slocum. It was a fair .ght. You stay put here till I come back. Don&#x2019;t try to follow me.&#x201d; <br>Thoughtfully, he left her some money. Not so thoughtfully, he neglected to kiss her good- bye before he rode away.

Wisps of coal smoke burned his eyes as he watched West Texas hills roll by at more than thirty miles an hour. He wished he were heading home. Instead, the train was carry ing him farther and farther from his new wife. <br>He sometimes wondered why he had decided to rejoin the Texas Rangers. There were less stressful ways to make a living. He had had more than enough of farming, walking all day behind a plow and a mule, taking verbal abuse from a cranky brother- in- law. He wanted to raise livestock, for that was something he could do on horse back, but a decent start in ranching required money. He did not yet have enough. Rangering seemed his best option for now. He regretted that it often took him too far and kept him too long away from Bethel. <br>He turned to a stall where his black horse stood tied, feet braced against the pull of the train&#x2019;s forward motion. He said, &#x201c;At least you&#x2019;re gettin&#x2019; to ride most of the way. Bannister&#x2019;s horse had to take it all on foot.&#x201d; <br>The Ranger of.ce in Fort Worth had received a wire saying that Donley Bannister was seen in the West Texas railroad town of Colorado City. Andy happened to be in Fort Worth to deliver a prisoner. He had been dispatched to apprehend Bannister and bring him back to stand trial for shooting Cletus Slocum. <br>At least the disagreement had been about something worthwhile, Andy thought. Too many men had been killed quarreling over such trivial matters as whiskey, cards, or dance hall girls. A horse was a different matter. A good horse might well justify a righ teous killing. <br>Extension of rails across the state had given Ranger ef.ciency a strong boost in these early 1880s. No matter how fast he traveled, a fugitive could not outrun the telegraph, and now he had to contend with the railroad as well. Rangers could put their horses on a train and cover distances in hours that would otherwise keep them in the saddle for days. They could move ahead of a .eeing suspect and cut him off or at least rush to wherever he had last been seen and shorten his lead. That was Andy&#x2019;s mission on this trip. <br>To the best of his knowledge, he had never seen Bannister. He had a physical description of the man, however, in the handwritten fugitive book he carried in his pocket: tall, husky, with pale gray eyes and a small scar on his left cheekbone where a mule had once kicked him. Probably a bit crazy too. A kick in the head could do that to a man, and nothing could kick harder than a mule. <br>The train chugged to a stop at a siding beside a tower upon which stood a large wooden water tank. Andy climbed down to stretch his aching legs and beheld the largest windmill he had ever seen. He judged its wheel to be twenty feet across, maybe twenty- .ve. Locomotive boilers required a lot of water to produce steam. The windmill, vital to the railroads, had also done much to open up large areas of West Texas for settlement by farmers and ranchers. They provided water where nature had neglected to do so. <br>He had recently placed a smaller mill over a hand- dug well on acreage he had bought in the hill country west of San Antonio. Someday, when he had saved enough, he planned to resign from the Rangers again, build a house beside the windmill and move there with Bethel. It was a good grass country for cattle, and several people had brought in sheep. Andy had no prejudice against woolies. They seemed to thrive so long as their own er could .ght off the wolves and coyotes and bobcats. These had a strong taste for lambs. <br>The thought of Bethel brought both warmth and pain. Stationed in a Ranger camp near a former army post town, Fort McKavett, he had rented a small house at the edge of the settlement. There she was able to grow a garden and raise chickens. He had spent nights with her when he was not away on duty. He realized this was not the customary way for a young couple to begin married life. Too often he had to kiss her good- bye and ride away without knowing when he might return. Looking back, which he always did, he would see her small .gure standing there, waving, watching him until he was beyond sight. <br>He had warned her at the beginning that as a Ranger&#x2019;s wife she would spend many days and nights alone, waiting, wishing. But he wondered if she had fully understood how often she would have only a .ock of chickens and a brown dog for company. He even wondered if he should have put off marriage until he could provide her with a more stable home. But both had waited a long time already, almost beyond endurance. <br>He hoped he could capture the fugitive quickly and get back to her. A dispatch had indicated that Bannister could probably make a strong case for self- defense if he had stayed in Junction and faced trial. But he had chosen to run, so he was playing hell with Andy&#x2019;s married life. <br>The train&#x2019;s black- uniformed conductor walked down the line after seeing that the boiler was properly .lled. Pulling out his pocket watch and checking the time, he said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be pullin&#x2019; out in a couple of minutes, Ranger. Ought to be in Colorado City in an hour.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Andy said. &#x201c;The sooner there, the sooner I can get my business done and go home.&#x201d; <br>The conductor gave him a quizzical smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet you&#x2019;ve got a young wife waitin&#x2019; for you. That&#x2019;d account for your constipated look.&#x201d; <br>Andy&#x2019;s face warmed. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know it showed.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know the signs from personal experience. Seems like I&#x2019;ve been married since I was six years old.&#x201d; <br>Andy asked, &#x201c;How do you handle it, bein&#x2019; away from home so much?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Home these days is what ever train I happen to be on.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t miss bein&#x2019; with your wife?&#x201d; <br>Thoughtfully the conductor said, &#x201c;Son, the .re burns hot when you .rst get married, but then it cools down. There&#x2019;s times you start feelin&#x2019; crowded. You look for a reason to get away for a while, and she&#x2019;s just as anxious to be shed of you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be that way for me and Bethel.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It will. Nature works it out like that to keep married couples from killin&#x2019; one another.&#x201d; The conductor frowned. &#x201c;You ain&#x2019;t told me, but I suspect you&#x2019;re after a man. Is he dangerous?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I just know that he&#x2019;s charged with murder.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then he&#x2019;s dangerous. And you&#x2019;re .xin&#x2019; to tackle him by yourself?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s just one man.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If I was you, and I had a young wife waitin&#x2019; for me, I&#x2019;d .nd a safer way to make a livin&#x2019;.&#x201d; <br>Bethel had not said much directly, but Andy had sensed that she felt as the conductor did. One of these days, when he could afford to buy more land and the livestock to put on it... <br>The train slowly picked up speed. Andy watched the telephone poles going by. A line had been strung alongside the tracks all the way from Fort Worth. It didn&#x2019;t seem logical to him that progress could advance much farther. Just about everything conceivable had already been invented. <br>Colorado City was mostly new, an offspring of the railroad as it had advanced westward. When the boxcar was centered in front of a loading chute, Andy led the black horse down the ramp to a water trough. A little Mexican packmule followed like a faithful dog. After both animals had drunk their .ll, Andy rode up the street toward the court house. It was customary for a Ranger to call upon local peace of.cers unless there was a reason not to, such as a suspicion that they were in league with the lawbreakers. That was not the case here. <br>Andy introduced himself to the sheriff, a middle- aged man with graying hair and an expanding waistline. The sheriff said, &#x201c;I got a call that you&#x2019;d be on the train. I thought they&#x2019;d send an older, more experienced man.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m old enough. What&#x2019;s the latest about Donley Bannister?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nothin&#x2019; much more than what I wired your captain...</p></p><h2>The Psychology Of Buddhist Tantra</h2><p>This book masterfully clarifies the nature of tantric practice. In contrast to the approaches of conventional religion, tantra does not attempt to soothe the turmoil of existence with consoling promises of heaven and salvation. The tantric practitioner chooses to confront the bewildering and chaotic forces of fear, aggression, desire, and pride, and to work with them in such a way that they are channeled into creative expression, loving relationships, and wisely engaged forms of life. In order to make the processes of tantra psychologically intelligible for a contemporary reader, Rob Preece makes judicious use of the work of modern psychotherapy, forging a compelling link between a Western tradition that hearkens back to the alchemical traditions of our own past and the comparably alchemical strategies of Tibetan Buddhist tantric practices. In keeping with the pragmatic and therapeutic aims of both psychotherapy and Buddhist meditation, <i>The Psychology of Buddhist Tantra</i> never loses sight of the central importance of applying these ideas to the concrete realities of day-to-day life. By illuminating the richly symbolic language of tantra through the intermediate language of psychology, <i>The Psychology of Buddhist Tantra</i> points to the transformative nature of tantric practices.</p><p>Rob Preece has been a practicing Buddhist since 1973, principally within the Tibetan tradition. He has spent many years in intensive retreat in the Himalayas under the guidance of eminent Tibetan lamas. Preece has been working as a psychotherapist since 1987 and gives workshops on comparative Jungian and Buddhist psychology. An experienced meditation teacher and thangka painter, he lives in London and is the author of <i>The Wisdom of Imperfection</i> and <i>The Psychology of Buddhist Tantra</i>."British psychologist and longtime Tibetan Buddhist practitioner Rob Preece has given us one of the most illuminating unpackings of Tibetan tantra yet to emerge in the English language."&#x2014;Mark Epstein, author of <i>Thoughts Without a Thinker: Psychotherapy from a Buddhist Perspective</i> <br><br>"<i>The Psychology of Buddhist Tantra</i> succeeds in clarifying the nature of tantric practice. He does not seek to explain away the undeniably evocative and darkly potent language and imagery of tantra but to recognize them as transformative symbols of the rich complexity of our own inner lives."&#x2014;Stephen Batchelor, author of <i>Buddhism without Beliefs</i> <br><br>"The ancient therapeutic wealth and alchemy of the East is skillfully integrated into the pragmatism of the West, creatively transforming the present-day individual."&#x2014;<i>East and West Series</i> <br><br>"Draws on Jung's writings on Tantra and other Buddhist teachings to explore the rich symbolism and imagery of Tantra as a pattern for personal and spiritual growth."&#x2014;<i>The Middle Way</i> <br><br>"Following on the heels of <i>The Wisdom of Imperfection: the Challenge of Individuation in Buddhist Life</i>, Preece (Tibetan Buddhist teacher and transpersonal psychotherapist) offers another accessible, insightful, and engaging interweaving of Buddhist and Jungian perspectives on psychospiritual transformation. . . .

Her last collection, <b>Mysteries of Small Houses</b>, was a finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize in poetry and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. Structured as a long series of interconnected poems in which one of the main elements is an ongoing dialogue with a seedy detective, <b>Disobedience</b> sets out to explore the visible as well as the unconscious. These poems, composed during a fifteen-month period, also deal with being a woman in France, with turning fifty, and with being a poet, and thus seemingly despised or at least ignored.</p><p><b>Alice Notley</b> is a poet whose twenty previous titles include <b>The Descent of Alette, Beginning with a Stain, Homer's Art</b>, and <b>Selected Poems</b>. She wrote the introduction for her late first husband Ted Berrigan's <b>Selected Poems</b>. She lives in Paris.After many years as an independently published poet, Notley did two stellar books with Penguin in the '90s: the 1996 long-poem, Descent of Alette, and 1998's Pulitzer runner-up, Mysteries of Small Houses, recounting, among other things, Notley's marriage to the late poet Ted Berrigan. This huge third Penguin volume from Notley outshines its predecessors, a tall order indeed. Like Alette, Disobedience is a long, serial, subterranean journey, taking on the search for spiritual life in a corporatized society and anger at persistent male dominance. Along the way, it crosses the worlds of the living and the dead, the real and the imaginary, the particular and the symbolic, vacating everyday life of its assigned non-meanings and granting them wild, personal resonances: "I don't want to create meaning;/ I want to kill it / You made meaning; I'm/ trying to make life stand still,/ long enough so I can exist./ I, truly, am speaking." Many fictional elements crop up, such as a character who is variably named Hardwood, Hardware, Hardon or Mitch-ham (after the actor Robert Mitchum), moving in and out of focus as the stream of thought determines. Hardwood, who at times appears to be a stand-in for Notley's late second husband, the poet Douglas Oliver, seems at others to be an interior persona, the "hard," even male, aspect of her own psyche that she uses to power her defenses against the world. The naturalness of Notley's idiom, the distinctive and uncompromising perspective of her thought, the almost Rimbaudian zeal to break free of convention, the sense that she is, after all, very vulnerable in her struggle all these contradictory elements fire Notley along a comet's path of spiritual discontent. This book traces its arc beautifully. (Oct.) Forecast: A near-miss last time around, Notley should garner at least one major prize nomination for this accessible, fast-moving epic. Magazine items will focus on Notley's two poetic marriages, but young protesters will find this book a contemplative inspiration, while Notley's peers will recognize the hard-won knowledge of a long spiritual search. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>New Science of Life [Paperback] sheldrake-rupert</h2><p>After chemists crystallised a new chemical for the first time, it became easier and easier to crystallise in laboratories all over the world. After rats at Harvard first escaped from a new kind of water maze, successive generations learned quicker and quicker. Then rats in Melbourne, Australia learned yet faster. Rats with no trained ancestors shared in this improvement. Rupert Sheldrake sees these processes as examples of morphic resonance.

He has written two novels, <i>Here Be Monsters! </i>and <i>Worse Things Happen at Sea!</i>, both set in the wonderfully weird world of Ratbridge. He lives in Bath, England.<b> Chapter One: Coming Up! </b> <p> </p><p> </p><p> It was a late Sunday evening and Ratbridge stood silver gray and silent in the moonlight. Early evening rain had washed away the cloud of smoke that normally hung over the town, and now long shadows from the factory chimneys fell across oily puddles in the empty streets. The town was at rest. </p><p> The shadows moved slowly across the lane that ran behind Fore Street, revealing a heavy iron drain cover set among the cobbles. </p><p> Then the drain cover moved. Something was pushing it up from below. </p><p> One side of the cover lifted a few inches, and from beneath it, a pair of eyes scanned the lane. The drain cover lifted further, then slid sideways. A boy's head wearing a woven helmet with nine or ten antennae rose through the hole and glanced around. The boy shut his eyes, and he listened. For a moment all was quiet; then a distant dog bark echoed off the nearby walls. Silence returned. The boy opened his eyes, reached out of the hole, and pulled himself up and out into the lane. He was dressed very oddly. In addition to the helmet, he wore a large vest knitted from soft rope, which reached the ground, and under that a short one-piece suit made from old sugar sacks. His feet were wrapped in layers of rough cloth, tied with string. </p><p> Fixed about his body by wide leather straps was a strange contraption. On his front was a wooden box with a winding handle on one side, and two brass buttons and a knob on the front. A flexible metal tube connected the box to a pair of folded wings, made from leather, wood, and brass, which were attached to his back. </p><p> The boy slid the drain cover back into place, reached inside his under-suit, and pulled out a toy figure dressed just like him. He held the doll out and spoke. </p><p> "Grandfather, I am up top. I think I'll have to go gardening tonight. It must be Sunday; everything is shut. The bins behind the inn will be empty." He looked at the doll. </p><p> There was a crackle of static, then a thin voice came from the doll. "Well, you be careful, Arthur! And remember, only take from the bigger gardens -- and only then if they have plenty! There are a lot of people who can only survive by growing their own food." </p><p> Arthur smiled. He had heard this many times before. "Don't worry, Grandfather, I haven't forgotten! I'll only take what we need, and I <i>will</i> be careful. I'll see you as soon as I am done." </p><p> Arthur replaced the doll inside his suit, then started to wind the handle on the box. As he did, the box made a soft whirring noise. For nearly two minutes he wound, pausing occasionally when his hand started aching. Then a bell pinged from somewhere inside the box and he stopped. Arthur scanned the skyline, crouched, and then pressed one of the buttons. The wings on his back unfolded. He pressed the other button and at the same moment jumped as high as he could. Silently the wings rushed down and caught the air as he rose. At the bottom of their stroke, they folded, rose, and then beat down again. His wings were holding him in the air, a few feet above the ground. </p><p> Arthur reached for the knob and turned it just a little. As he did so, he tilted himself a little forward. He started to move. Arthur smiled....He was flying. </p><p> He moved slowly down the lane, keeping below the top of its walls. When he reached the end, he adjusted the knob again and rose up to a gap between the twin roofs of the Glue Factory. Arthur knew routes that were safe from the eyes of the townsfolk, and would keep to one of them tonight on the way to the particular garden he planned on visiting. When it was dark or there was thick smog, things were easy. But tonight was clear and the moon full. He'd been spotted twice before on nights like this, by children, from their bedroom windows. He'd got away with it so far, as nobody had believed the children when they said they had seen a fairy or flying boy, but tonight he was not going to take any chances. </p><p> Arthur reached the end of the gap between the roofs. He dipped a little and flew across a large stable yard. A horse started and whinnied as he flew over. He adjusted his wing speed and increased his height. The horse made him feel uneasy. At the far side of the yard he rose again, over a huge gate topped with spikes. He crossed a deserted alley, then moved down a narrow street flanked with the windowless backs of houses. At the far end of the street he slowed and then hovered in the air. In front of him was another high wall. Carefully he adjusted the knob and rose very gently to the point where he could just see the ground beyond the wall. It was a large vegetable garden. </p><p> Across the garden fell paths of pale light, cast from windows of the house. One of the windows was open. From it Arthur could hear raised voices and the clatter of dominoes. </p><p> <i>That should keep them busy!</i> he thought, scanning the garden again. Against the wall farthest from the house was a large glass lean-to. </p><p> He checked the windows of the house again, then rose over the wall and headed for the greenhouse, keeping above the beams of light. He came to rest in front of the greenhouse door. </p><p> Dark leafy forms filled the space. As Arthur entered, he recognized tomato plants climbing the strings, and cucumbers and grapes hanging from above. </p><p> He moved past all these and made his way to a tree against the far wall. </p><p> It was a tall tree with branches only at its top. Dangling from a stem below the branches was what looked like a stack of huge fat upside-down spiders. It was a large bunch of bananas. As Arthur got closer, he caught their scent. It was beautiful. </p><p> Arthur could hardly contain his delight. Bananas! He tore one from the bunch and ate it ravenously. When he finished, he looked over at the house. Nothing had changed. So, he reached inside his under-suit, pulled out a string bag, then grabbed a hold of the banana bunch and gave an eager tug. It wasn't as easy to pick the full bunch as it had been to pull off a single banana, and Arthur found he had to put his full weight on the bunch. A soft fibrous tearing sound started, but still the bunch did not come down. In desperation Arthur lifted his feet from the ground and swung his legs. All of a sudden there was a crack, and the whole bunch, along with Arthur, fell to the ground. The tree trunk sprang back up and struck the glass roof with a loud crack. The noise sounded out across the garden. </p><p> "Oi! There is something in the greenhouse," came a shout from the house. </p><p> Arthur scrambled to his feet, grabbed the string bag, and looked out through the glass. No one was in the garden yet. </p><p> He rushed to collect up as many of the bananas as possible, shoving them into the bag. Then he heard a door bang and the sound of footsteps. He ran out of the greenhouse. </p><p> Clambering toward him over the rows of vegetables was a very large lady with a very long stick. Arthur dashed over to one of the garden walls, stabbed at the buttons on the front of his box, and jumped. His wings snapped open and started to beat but not strongly enough to lift him. He landed back on the ground, his wings fluttering behind him. Arthur groaned -- the bananas! He had to adjust the wings for the extra weight. He wasn't willing to put the bananas down and fly away empty-handed -- they were too precious. He grabbed at the knob on the front of the box and twisted it hard. The wings immediately doubled their beating and became a blur. Just as the woman reached the spot where Arthur stood, he shot almost vertically upward. Furious, she swung her stick above her head and, before he could get out of range, landed a hard blow on his wings, sending him spinning. </p><p> "You little varmint! Come down here and give me back my bananas!" the woman cried. Arthur grasped at the top of the wall to steady himself. The stick now swished inches below his feet. He adjusted the wings quickly and made off over the wall. Shouts of anger followed him. </p><p> Arthur felt sick to the pit of his stomach. Coming up at night to collect food was always risky, and this was the closest he'd ever been to being caught. He needed somewhere quiet to rest and recover. </p><p> <i>I wish we could live aboveground like everybody else!</i> he thought. </p><p> Now he flew across the town by the safest route he knew -- dipping between roofs, up the darkest alleys, and across deserted yards, till finally he reached the abandoned Cheese Hall. He knew he would be alone there. </p><p> The Cheese Hall had been the grandest of all the buildings in the town and was only overshadowed by a few of the factory chimneys. In former times, it had been the home of the Ratbridge Cheese Guild. But now the industry was dead, and the Guild and all its members ruined. The Hall was boarded up and deserted. Its gilded statues that once shone out across the town were blackened by the very soot that had poisoned the cheese. </p><p> Arthur landed on the bridge of the roof, and settled himself among the statues. As he sat catching his breath, it occurred to him that maybe he should inspect his wings for damage. The woman had landed a fairly heavy blow, but Arthur decided it would be too dangerous and awkward to take his wings off high up here on the roof, and besides, they seemed to be fine. Then something distracted him from his thoughts -- a noise. It sounded like a mournful bleat, from somewhere below. He listened carefully, intrigued, but heard no more. When he finally felt calm again, he stowed the bananas behind one of the statues, climbed out from his hiding place, and flew up to the best observation spot in the whole town. This was the plinth on the top of the dome, which supported the weather vane and lightning conductor. </p><p> A complete panorama of the town and the surrounding countryside, broken only by the chimneystacks of the factories, was laid out before him. In the far distance he could just make out some sort of procession in the moonlight, making for the woods. It looked as though something was being chased by a group of horses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2005 by Alan Snow </p><p> <b></b></p><b> Chapter 2: The Hunt </b></p><h2>Justice Ascending (The Scorpius Syndrome)</h2><p><b><b>&#x201c;Thrilling post-apocalyptic romance at its dark, sizzling best!&#x201d; &#x2014;Lara Adrian</b><br><br></b>Before surviving the Scorpius bacterium, Tace Justice was a good ole Texas cowboy who served his country and loved his mama.

I could walk. I did walk, around our neighborhood, thinking, Am I having contractions? When Mike got home, we rented a movie and bought a box of brownie mix, and after dinner (what did we eat? I remember only the brownies, my wanting them) I mixed and baked the brownies. Later I would wonder, What was I thinking, making brownies? But for a while then, they still tasted good to me, and I wasn&#x2019;t in so much pain that I couldn&#x2019;t enjoy the movie, too&#x2014;though I don&#x2019;t remember what it was now, and I don&#x2019;t think we finished watching it. The contractions got stronger, then stayed the same through the night, somewhere between five to ten minutes apart, varying in length. I couldn&#x2019;t sleep, and by morning I decided I needed an epidural. I&#x2019;d been unsure about the epidural question&#x2014;I thought I would see what it was like, that if I could do it without, I&#x2019;d rather, but that I wouldn&#x2019;t go crazy about it. Now I thought, I can&#x2019;t do it without. I need to sleep. That was my main priority&#x2014;to rest. Which people had told me the epidural let you do. So we called Dr. Yang,2 who said she doubted I was in labor but that sure, I could meet her at her office at nine. <br>A word about Dr. Yang, whom other patients sometimes refer to as &#x201c;the Yangster,&#x201d; who my sister-in-law warned me was &#x201c;a little intense,&#x201d; and whom I generally just call &#x201c;my crazy Chinese doctor.&#x201d; She is temperamentally similar in some ways to the Chinese grocer in our corner bodega, except that instead of yelling at me, &#x201c;This is DAIKON!&#x201d; (when I called one night in my seventh month, terrified by the white puffy flesh suddenly bulging from the part of my stomach where I imagined my baby&#x2019;s head to be) she yelled, &#x201c;That is your COLON, ANNA! It&#x2019;s coming through the tissue! It&#x2019;s just ABDOMINAL SEPARATION! YOU HAVE TO RELAX!&#x201d; <br>We made the trip from Brooklyn to TriBeCa, our still-shiny labor ball stowed in the backseat. It was a Saturday, the bridge mercifully empty. At Dr. Yang&#x2019;s office, we were let in by a group of Chinese construction workers, busy affixing a new door. Dr. Yang, the leader explained, would be back to meet us; she&#x2019;d had to go to the hardware store for a tool. <br>Dr. Yang is a solo practitioner, I should explain, which in her case means not only that she delivers every baby of every patient but also oversees every hinge being fitted to her doors. <br>We went into a room at the back and waited. I got very angry, waiting. I&#x2019;d been angry at Dr. Yang before, many times, but now I felt angry in the way a laboring woman feels angry. She had abandoned me, I decided. And now? Now? What did this portend about my labor and delivery? Would she leave as the baby was coming out to go buy a box of nails? <br>Dr. Yang arrived some ten minutes later. Okay, Anna, let&#x2019;s see, let&#x2019;s see. Oh, I can see just looking at you, you&#x2019;re not in labor! <br>Of course the second she walked in the room, my contractions had diminished. <br>After her examination, she declared, See! You are only fifty percent effaced, and barely dilated even a centimeter! <br>I started to cry. But I&#x2019;m exhausted! I said. I did not say, I want an epidural, because I knew now how stupid and impossible that idea was. I can&#x2019;t keep going! <br>My guess is you&#x2019;ll go into labor in the next day or two. <br>But this <i>is</i> labor, I told her. <br>Well, she said. Look. Anna. You have a very strong mind. I know this about you. You can make many things happen with your mind&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>You&#x2019;re saying this is all in my head? <br>What I&#x2019;m trying to say&nbsp;&#x2026; (This was Dr. Yang&#x2019;s favorite phrase.) Listen. You have a very strong mind. In China, this is a very prized attribute. I? I can lower my blood pressure by ten points just thinking about it. In China, people can move cups just looking at them! What I&#x2019;m trying to say&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>As she spoke, I was vaguely aware&#x2014;and disappointed, and ashamed&#x2014;that I wasn&#x2019;t in as much pain as I&#x2019;d been earlier. <br>What I&#x2019;m trying to say is you&#x2019;re feeling your pain at a ten, and I want you to feel it at a four. <br>But I need to sleep! I said, still crying. <br>Yes. Exactly. You need to rest. Sometimes that brings labor on itself. <br>But I can&#x2019;t sleep! I said. It&#x2019;s too painful! (And I <i>am</i> in labor, I wanted to add, but didn&#x2019;t.)3 <br>Here. Listen. I want you to go home, take an Ambien&#x2014;I write you out a prescription&#x2014;take the hottest bath you can stand, drink a glass of wine. Relax. <br>I thought pregnant women aren&#x2019;t supposed to take hot baths, I said. <br>Baloney, Dr. Yang said, as she had about many other myths I&#x2019;d brought up during our visits. The baby is all there. She not bothered by the heat! <br>I explained to Dr. Yang that the one time I&#x2019;d taken Ambien, two nights before my wedding, I&#x2019;d awakened hours later on the bathroom floor. I hadn&#x2019;t even made it to the bed. <br>Then take half! she cried, and ushered us out. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I felt desperate on the way home. The next day or two? <br>But at home, I followed Dr. Yang&#x2019;s directions&#x2014;except for the wine, which I thought would make me throw up. After the bath, I got into bed (it was about 11:00 a.m. now) and for the next couple hours I managed to sleep between&#x2014;though not during&#x2014;contractions. It was a vague, hazy sleep, the four- and five-minute snatches building on one another. When I woke up and went to the bathroom, I had blood in my underwear. Dr. Yang had said, When you&#x2019;re in labor, you&#x2019;ll have blood, you&#x2019;ll have all sorts of things coming out of you. <br>Hooray!4 <br>It was about two now. From there, the contractions got steadily stronger. I rested my forearms on the ball, my knees on the floor, Mike pushing my hip bones together, as we learned in class. Nothing made it less painful, but at least we were doing something, and I couldn&#x2019;t <i>not</i> be on my knees. Between contractions, I closed my eyes and rested. That was what I did best, I think, during my labor, really rested between contractions, not fearing the next one, but really sinking into the relief of those moments. <br>This better be labor! I think I said a few times. And around five, I said, We have to go to the hospital. I don&#x2019;t care if Dr. Yang laughs and sends us back. We&#x2019;re going. <br>Mike called Dr. Yang. Dr. Yang loves Mike, and she said, Well, Mike, if <i>you</i> really think it&#x2019;s different from this morning, I&#x2019;ll meet you at the hospital. I have another patient already there. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The car ride was the worst part, by far. It took us about fifty minutes, across the bridge (which one did Mike take?), through lower Manhattan, up the West Side Highway, which is not a highway at all, but a misnamed series of traffic lights that seemed to be red, every one, the whole way. I was, as Mike told me later, mooing like a cow. I was grabbing at the doors, writhing to the floor. It was awful.5 <br>In the lobby, the triage nurse didn&#x2019;t ask what we were doing there, but sent us up to labor and delivery. Dr. Yang was still with the other patient, so a resident examined me. I remember looking at her face, staring, willing her, thinking, If she tells me I&#x2019;m only two centimeters dilated, I will die. I will die. I really will, right here. I will die. <br>But I wasn&#x2019;t. I was eight centimeters dilated. &#x201c;Entering transition,&#x201d; as she put it. <br>Hooray! I thought. I&#x2019;m in labor! Then I thought&#x2014;and shouted&#x2014;I want an epidural NOW! <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>In the delivery room, the nurse told me Dr. Yang would be there soon, and that she had to get an IV in me to deliver fluids so they could do the epidural. <br>But where&#x2019;s the epidural? I asked. <br>Anesthesiology&#x2019;s been backed up all day, I heard her say. (She couldn&#x2019;t have said this to me, right? Wouldn&#x2019;t that have been too cruel?) <br>What? What? <br>It&#x2019;s okay. Here, said the nurse, trying to get the IV in. <br>But I was so dehydrated, the first veins she tried disappeared, and then she burst the vein in my left hand, which would be bruised for weeks, and then she couldn&#x2019;t get it into my right hand. Finally, she got it into my right arm. At some point in all this, I said, I have to pee, I have to go to the bathroom, and she said, You just go now. Just go. And I did. I peed all over myself. It was the first time I&#x2019;d peed all over myself since I was a kid, I guess. I was just like a damn baby. <br>I remember hearing her say at some point during this, We have pushing! And I realized I was pushing. She said, I think she&#x2019;s fully dilated, and I said, Where is Dr. Yang? And soon Dr. Yang was there, in a brightly flowered velour dress, with pink lipstick to match,6 and she said something to me&#x2014;she actually said this&#x2014;about how the residents often overestimate how dilated women are. And I thought, Fuck you.7 Where is my epidural? Am I shitting myself? Oh shit, I might be shitting myself. And the nurse said, She&#x2019;s fully dilated, I really think so and Dr. Yang checked me out and didn&#x2019;t confirm or not confirm this, but she said to me, Anna, if it feels better to push, you can push. <br>I&#x2019;d already been pushing, but I kept at it. And it did feel better. It felt great. I mean, it hurt like hell, but it was something to do, not just enduring the waves of pain but pushing. I was grunting insanely, making disgusting noises. Mike was holding one leg, Dr. Yang the other, and on her face, I remember, was total, utter joy. <br>I said, Wait. Am I pushing out the baby? I really thought, until that point, that I was pushing because it felt better. <br>YES! she cried. Here. You can feel it. <br>And I felt Sylvie&#x2019;s head (Oh, I&#x2019;m going to cry now), a mushy, hairy, slimy thing.8 And I kept pushing. And when she came out (it was 7:33 now; I&#x2019;d pushed for about twenty-five minutes; we&#x2019;d been at the hospital about an hour and a half), it was like a building erupting from me. And once it was out, it was out. Over. Sylvie screamed, they brought her right to me, she had <i>so</i> much hair! There was a little stitching to be done, but I barely noticed. And Sylvie looked at me, found my breast, and started to suck. The next day, the pediatrician put her finger in Sylvie&#x2019;s mouth and said, That&#x2019;s the best suck I&#x2019;ve felt in a while. And it was true, from the beginning: Sylvie taught me how to nurse her.9 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Eleanor Henderson and Anna Solomon <br></p><h2>Kissing the Hag</h2><p>Kissing the Hag is a wonderfully intelligent, earthy, cosmic diary of the feminine life... this life-soaked book remains close to the fluids of body and soul...

Inside, he looks around as if he&#x2019;s just entered a crime scene, taking in his surroundings, making judgments about what must have been a parlor for some wealthy aristocrat more than a century ago. He surveys mahogany paneling, Persian rugs, brass chandeliers, Victorian theater broadsheets, oil portraits and polished old stairs that lead somewhere he&#x2019;ll probably never go.<br><br>He takes a seat on a stiff antique sofa, a grandfather clock reminding him that he is exactly on time and that District Attorney Monique Lamont (&#x201c;Money La-Mount,&#x201d; as he calls her), the woman who basically runs his life, is nowhere in sight. In Massachusetts, the DAs have jurisdiction over all homicides and have their own state police investigative service assigned to them, and what that means is that Lamont can bring anybody she wants into her personal squad, meaning she can also get rid of anybody she wants. He belongs to her and she has her ways of reminding him of that.<br><br>This is the latest, the worst of all her political maneuvering, and in some instances shortsighted reasoning, or what he sometimes views as her fantasies, all of it radiating from her insatiable ambition and need to control. She suddenly decides to send him way down South to Knoxville, Tennessee, to attend the National Forensic Academy, saying that when he returns he will enlighten his colleagues about the latest innovations in crime scene investigation, show them how to do it right, exactly right. Show them how to ensure that no criminal investigation will ever, and I mean ever, be compromised by the mishandling of evidence or the absence of procedures and analyses that should have been done, she said. He doesn&#x2019;t understand it. The Massachusetts State Police has CSIs. Why not send one of them? She wouldn&#x2019;t listen. She wouldn&#x2019;t explain.<br><br>Win looks down at the soggy shoes he bought for twenty-two dollars at the vintage clothing shop called Hand-Me-Ups. He notices the beginning of dried water spots on the gray suit he got for a hundred and twenty dollars at the same shop where he&#x2019;s gotten quite a lot of designer clothing dirt cheap because everything is used, cast off by rich people who easily tire of things or are infirm or dead. He waits and worries, wondering what is so important that Lamont has summoned him all the way up here from Knoxville. Roy, her wimpish, supercilious press secretary, called him this morning, yanked him out of class, told him to be on the next flight to Boston.<br><br>Right this minute? Why? Win protested.<br><br>Because she said so, Roy replied.<br><br>Inside the high-rise, precast Cambridge District Court building, Monique Lamont emerges from the private powder room inside her large private office. Unlike many DAs and others who wade in the world of criminal justice, she doesn&#x2019;t collect police caps and patches or foreign uniforms and weapons or framed photographs of famed law enforcement officials. Those who give her such mementos do so only once, because she doesn&#x2019;t hesitate to give them back or away. She happens to like glass.<br><br>Art glass, stained glass, Venetian glass, new glass, old glass. When sunlight fills her office, it turns into a prismatic fire, flashing, winking, glowing, sparkling in a spectrum of colors, distracting people, amazing them.<br><br>She welcomes distracted, amazed people to her rainbow, then introduces them to the nasty storm that preceded it.<br><br>&#x201c;Hell no,&#x201d; she picks up where she left off as she sits down at her expansive glass desk, a see-through desk that doesn&#x2019;t deter her in the least from wearing short skirts. &#x201c;Another damn educational video on drunk driving is not going to happen. Does anybody besides me think outside the box?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Last week in Tewksbury, an entire family was killed by a drunk driver,&#x201d; Roy says from a sofa catty-corner to the desk, looking at her legs when he assumes she doesn&#x2019;t notice. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s far more relevant to citizens than some old murder case from some provincial Southern city nobody around here cares . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Roy.&#x201d; Lamont crosses her legs and watches him watching her. &#x201c;Do you have a mother?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Monique.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course you have a mother.&#x201d; She gets up, starts pacing, wishes the sun was out.<br><br>She hates rain.<br><br>&#x201c;How would you like it, Roy, if your ninety-pound elderly mother were beaten savagely in her own home and left to die alone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh come on, Monique. That&#x2019;s not the point. We should be focusing on a Massachusetts unsolved homicide, not one in Hickville. How many times do we have to go through this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re foolish, Roy. We send in one of our .nest and solve it and get&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, I know. Huge national attention.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The sure, strong hand reaching down to help those less fortunate, less, well... less everything. We get the old evidence, reexamine it&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And make Huber look good. Somehow, it will be him and the governor who look good. You&#x2019;re kidding yourself if you think otherwise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It will make me look good. And you&#x2019;re going to make sure of that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>She abruptly stops talking as the office door opens and coincidentally, maybe too coincidentally, her law clerk walks in without knocking. Huber&#x2019;s son. It briefly crosses her mind that he&#x2019;s been eavesdropping. But the door is shut. It isn&#x2019;t possible.<br><br>&#x201c;Toby?&#x201d; she warns. &#x201c;Am I psychotic or did you just walk in without knocking again?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry about that. Man, I got too much on my mind.&#x201d; He sniffs, shakes his shaved head, looks half stoned. &#x201c;I just wanted to remind you I&#x2019;m taking off.&#x201d;<br><br>For good, she wishes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m completely aware,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>&#x201c;Be back next Monday. Hanging out at the Vineyard, chilling, my dad knows where to find me if you need me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve taken care of all pending matters?&#x201d;<br><br>He sniffs again. Lamont&#x2019;s pretty sure he&#x2019;s fond of cocaine. &#x201c;Uh, like what?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Uh, like everything I&#x2019;ve put on your desk,&#x201d; she says, tapping a gold pen on a legal pad.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yeah, sure. And I was a good boy, cleaned up everything, straightened up so you won&#x2019;t have to pick up after me.&#x201d; He smirks, his resentful feelings toward her peeking through his fog, leaves, shuts the door.<br><br>&#x201c;One of my bigger mistakes,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Never do a favor for a colleague.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s obvious you&#x2019;ve made your decision and it&#x2019;s as final as death,&#x201d; Roy picks up where he left off. &#x201c;And I reiterate my belief that you&#x2019;re making a very big mistake. Maybe a fatal one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cut the death analogies, Roy. They really annoy me. I could use a coffee.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Cut the death analogies, Roy. They really annoy me. I could use a coffee.&#x201d;<br><br>Governor Miles Crawley sits in the backseat of his black limousine, the partition up, his executive protection out of sight, unable to hear him on the phone.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so damn sure you get careless,&#x201d; he says, staring down at his long, pinstripe-clad legs stretched out, staring blankly at his shiny black shoes. &#x201c;What if someone talks? And we shouldn&#x2019;t be talking about this....&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The someone involved isn&#x2019;t going to talk. That&#x2019;s guaranteed. And I&#x2019;m never careless.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No guarantees except death and taxes,&#x201d; the governor says, cryptically.<br><br>&#x201c;In this instance, you&#x2019;ve got a guarantee, no way to lose. Who didn&#x2019;t know where it was? Who lost it? Who hid it? No matter what, who looks bad?&#x201d;<br><br>The governor gazes out the window at the darkness, the rain, the lights of Cambridge shining through, not so sure he should have gone along with this, decides, &#x201c;Well, there&#x2019;s no turning back since it&#x2019;s out to the press. You&#x2019;d damn well better hope you&#x2019;re right, because the person I&#x2019;ll blame is you. It was your damn idea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Trust me, it will all be good news for you.&#x201d;<br><br>The governor could use a little good news. His wife is a real pain in the ass these days, his bowels are acting up, and he&#x2019;s off to another dinner. This one is at the Fogg Art Museum, where he&#x2019;ll walk around looking at Degas paintings, then say a few words to make sure all the art-loving philanthropists and Harvard elitists are reminded of what a cultured man he is.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about this any further,&#x201d; the governor says.<br><br>&#x201c;Miles . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He hates being called by his first name, no matter how long he has known the person. It&#x2019;s Governor Crawley. Someday Senator Crawley.<br><br>&#x201c;. . . you&#x2019;ll be thanking me, I promise . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make me repeat myself,&#x201d; Governor Crawley warns. &#x201c;This is the last time we have this conversation.&#x201d; He ends the call, tucks his cell phone back in his jacket pocket.<br><br>The limousine pulls up to the front of the Fogg. Crawley waits for his private protection to let him out, lead him on to his next political performance, alone. Damn his wife and her damn sinus headaches. He was briefed on Degas not even an hour ago, at least knows how to pronounce his name and that he was French.<br><br>Lamont gets up, slowly paces, looking out the window at a depressingly dark, wet dusk, sipping coffee that tastes burned.<br><br>&#x201c;The media&#x2019;s already started calling,&#x201d; Roy says as a warning.<br><br>&#x201c;I believe that was the plan,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>&#x201c;And we need a damage control plan.. . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Roy. I can&#x2019;t hear much more of this!&#x201d;<br><br>He&#x2019;s such a coward, the gutless wonder, she thinks, her back to him.<br><br>&#x201c;Monique, I just don&#x2019;t see how you can possibly believe that any scheme of the governor&#x2019;s is going to benefit you in the end.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If we&#x2019;re going to get fifty million dollars to build a new crime lab,&#x201d; she repeats herself slowly, as if he is stupid, &#x201c;we have to get attention, show the public, the legislators, we&#x2019;re completely justified in upgrading technology, hiring more scientists, buying more lab equipment, building the biggest DNA database in the country, maybe even in the world. We solve some old case that people in the good ol&#x2019; South have left in a cardboard box for twenty years, and we&#x2019;re heroes. The taxpayers support us. Nothing succeeds like success.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;More of Huber&#x2019;s brainwashing. What crime lab director wouldn&#x2019;t want to talk you into that, despite the risk to you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t you see what a good idea this is?&#x201d; she says in frustration, looking out at the rain, the relentless, dreary rain.<br><br>&#x201c;Because Governor Crawley hates you,&#x201d; Roy replies flatly. &#x201c;Ask yourself why he would hand this off to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m the most visible DA in the commonwealth. I&#x2019;m a woman. So he doesn&#x2019;t look like the small-minded, sexist, right-wing bigot he really is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And running against him&#x2014;any failure will be on your head, not his. You&#x2019;ll be Robert E. Lee surrendering your sword, not him.. . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So now he&#x2019;s Ulysses S. Grant. Win will get this done.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;More likely do you in.&#x201d;<br><br>She slowly turns around, faces Roy, watches him flip through a notebook.<br><br>&#x201c;Just how much do you know about him?&#x201d; he says.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the best investigator in the unit. Politically, a perfect choice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Vain, obsessed with clothes.&#x201d; He reads his notes. &#x201c;Designer suits, a Hummer, a Harley, raising questions about his finances. A Rolex.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A Breitling. Titanium. Probably gently used, from one of his many secondhand shops,&#x201d; she says.<br>&nbsp;<br>Roy looks up, baffled. &#x201c;How do you know where he gets his stuff?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because I recognize the finer things in life. One morning I asked him how he afforded the Herm�s tie he happened to be wearing that day.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Consistently late when called to crime scenes,&#x201d; Roy goes on.<br><br>&#x201c;According to whom?&#x201d;<br><br>He flips several more pages, runs down one of them with his .nger. She waits for his lips to move as he silently reads. There, they just moved. Dear God. The world is full of imbeciles.<br><br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t appear he&#x2019;s gay,&#x201d; Roy continues. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s good news.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Actually, it would be rather huge-minded of us if our poster-boy detective was gay. What does he drink?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well he&#x2019;s not gay, that&#x2019;s for sure,&#x201d; Roy says. &#x201c;A womanizer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;According to whom? What does he like to drink?&#x201d;<br><br>Roy pauses, confounded, says, &#x201c;Drink? No, he doesn&#x2019;t have that problem at least.. . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Vodka, gin, beer?&#x201d; She&#x2019;s about to lose her patience entirely.<br><br>&#x201c;I got no friggin&#x2019; idea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then you call his pal Huber and find out. And I mean before I get to the faculty club.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes I just don&#x2019;t understand you, Monique.&#x201d; He returns to his notes. &#x201c;Narcissistic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who wouldn&#x2019;t be if he looked like him,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>&#x201c;Conceited, a pretty-boy empty suit. You should hear what the other cops have to say about him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I believe I just did.&#x201d;<br><br>Win Garano enters her mind. His dark, wavy hair, flawless face. A body that looks sculpted of creamy tan stone. And his eyes, something about his eyes. W...</p><h2>The Missing Class: Portraits of the Near Poor in America</h2><p>Named one of the Best Business Books of 2007 by <i>Library Journal</i><br><br><i>The Missing Class</i> gives voice to the 54 million Americans, including 21 percent of the nation's children, who are sandwiched between poor and middle class. While government programs help the needy and politicians woo the more fortunate, the "Missing Class" is largely invisible and ignored. Through the experiences of nine families, Katherine Newman and Victor Tan Chen trace the unique problems faced by individuals in this large and growing demographic-the "near poor." The question for the Missing Class is not whether they're doing better than the truly poor-they are. The question is whether these individuals, on the razor's edge of subsistence, are safely ensconced in the Missing Class or in danger of losing it all. <i>The Missing Class</i> has much to tell us about whether the American dream still exists for those who are sacrificing daily to achieve it.</p><p><b>Katherine Newman</b> is professor of sociology and James Knapp Dean of the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. Author of ten books on middle-class economic instability, urban poverty, and the sociology of inequality, Newman has taught at the University of California-Berkeley, Columbia, Harvard, and Princeton.<br><br><b>Victor Tan Chen</b>&nbsp;is the founding editor and president of INTHEFRAY Magazine (http://inthefray.org/), an award-winning publication that seeks to question, inform, and inspire conversations about identity and community. His work has appeared in numerous publications, including&nbsp;<i>Newsday</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>Minority Law Journal</i>, and in the book&nbsp;<i>Chutes and Ladders</i>. He is a Harvard doctoral candidate in sociology and social policy.In this compassionate and clear-eyed analysis, sociologist Newman and journalist Chen posit that the middle class gains of the 1990s have been imperiled by the recent rollback of New Deal&#x2013;style government aid. Millions of Americans climbed above the poverty line at the end of the 20th century, but since then, the risk of falling back has grown substantially. This policy-oriented collection of case studies addresses the plight of the 57 million near-poor, a largely overlooked missing class just out of reach of public assistance. Despite decent wages, the authors argue, the near-poor are saddled with various burdens that keep them hovering one disaster away from outright poverty and put their children at high risk of sliding down the economic ladder. Drawing on interviews conducted from 1995 to 2002 with families and public service professionals in the New York area, the authors chart in alternately uplifting and dismal detail the distinct perspectives of several low-income households. While they don't address those entering the missing class from above and perhaps too easily extrapolate from their conclusions, Newman and Chen contribute significantly to the dialogue on America's widening inequities. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet no matter how far she leaned or how utterly still she stood, she heard nothing more than the tick tock of the kitchen clock and the faintest hint of a sporadic tapping.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; she called out as she set her powder blue carry-on beside a floral soft side bag and an ancient-looking maroon hard side suitcase tucked beneath Margaret Louise&#x2019;s foyer table. A quick peek at the luggage tag on each let her know that at least Rose Winters and Beatrice Tharrington had arrived. &#x201c;Margaret Louise? Are you here?&#x201d;</p><p>The creek of a door toward the back of the house was followed by a never-before-heard hushed version of a voice that always made her happy. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in here, Victoria . . . in my sewin&#x2019; room. But come quick. There ain&#x2019;t much time.&#x201d;</p><p>Her mouth froze mid-smile as an image of Rose&#x2019;s eighty-year-old body, slumped atop Margaret Louise&#x2019;s sewing machine, sent her sprinting across the house with nary a thought to the brightly colored obstacles that littered her path with the promise of a sprained ankle if she misnavigated. &#x201c;Is Rose okay? Did she fall? Is she sick?&#x201d; she managed to ask as she skidded to a stop beside her friend.</p><p>&#x201c;Rose is fine, Victoria.&#x201d; Margaret Louise rested a plump and reassuring hand on Tori&#x2019;s shoulder while simultaneously guiding her gaze toward the beloved matriarch of their sewing circle. Sure enough, leaning toward the screen of Margaret Louise&#x2019;s desktop computer was the diminutive white-haired woman that reminded Tori of her own late great-grandmother in everything from strength of spirit to shared tidbits of wisdom. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s havin&#x2019; a hootenanny in here lendin&#x2019; her smarts to Operation Dixie.&#x201d;</p><p>Tori worked to steady her breath as she took in Beatrice&#x2019;s typing, Rose&#x2019;s fevered dictation, and the handsome gray-haired gentleman that smiled out at them from the nearly monitor-sized snapshot. &#x201c;Operation Dixie?&#x201d;</p><p>Dixie Dunn was, well, Dixie Dunn. Stout in mind and body, Dixie had served as head librarian of Sweet Briar Public Library for more than four decades. Her job, as she liked to remind everyone within a fifty-mile radius, was unceremoniously snatched from her still-able hands when she was forced into retirement by the library board. The fact that Tori&#x2019;s hiring came after the board&#x2019;s decision mattered naught to the seventy-something, who&#x2019;d spent the next year or so glaring at the same newcomer the rest of her sewing circle had embraced with open arms.</p><p>Fortunately, time and a handful of olive branch offerings&#x2014;including riding to Dixie&#x2019;s rescue after both a fire and a dead body&#x2014;had eased virtually all of Dixie&#x2019;s resentment toward Tori and the two had become friends. Still, mention of the woman&#x2019;s name tended to give her pause. Especially when it was said in conjunction with the mischievous glint Tori now saw in Margaret Louise&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;We&#x201d;&#x2014;Margaret Louise pulled her hand from Tori&#x2019;s shoulder and waved it toward Rose and Beatrice&#x2014;&#x201c;think most of Dixie&#x2019;s bellyachin&#x2019; comes from bein&#x2019; lonely. When Nina came back from maternity leave, Dixie&#x2019;s volunteerin&#x2019; at the library wasn&#x2019;t needed no more. And as much as she likes to toot her horn &#x2019;bout her involvement with Home Fare and the shut-ins, she still ain&#x2019;t happy. Not like she should be anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why she needs a bloke.&#x201d; Beatrice glanced over her shoulder at Tori, the hint of crimson on her pale skin a perfect accompaniment to the shy smile that flickered across the young nanny&#x2019;s face. Employed by a wealthy Sweet Briar family, the British girl&#x2019;s departure from her teen years four years ago gave her the honor of being Rose&#x2019;s opposing bookend when it came to the age range within the Sweet Briar Ladies Society Sewing Circle.</p><p>Tori inched her way into the small, eight-by-eight-foot room until she was close enough to see that the man on the computer screen had brilliant blue eyes, was listed as seventy-two years old, and had the kind of face stubble that instantly elevated his appeal into the alluring category. &#x201c;I really think you should leave the whole notion of dating up to Dixie. Maybe she doesn&#x2019;t want a man in her life right now. Or maybe her tastes are different than yours.&#x201d;</p><p>Margaret Louise unzipped the jacket of her polyester jogging suit halfway down her rounded stomach, shaking her head emphatically as she did. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you worry that pretty head of yours none, Victoria. Dixie already knows &#x2019;bout John Dreyer. In fact, they&#x2019;re gonna meet face-to-face over breakfast tomorrow mornin&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>Her focus ricocheted off the man and landed squarely on Margaret Louise. &#x201c;But we&#x2019;ll be in the city tomorrow, remember?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And so will John, on account of that&#x2019;s where he&#x2019;s livin&#x2019;.&#x201d; Margaret Louise rocked back on the soles of her Keds and clapped her hands with glee. &#x201c;Why, it&#x2019;s hard to think this is anything but a match made in heaven, ain&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>Tori looked at the screen again, the incessant tapping of Beatrice&#x2019;s fingers against the keyboard making it difficult to think, let alone truly process the situation. &#x201c;Okay, so what are the three of you doing in here with his profile and picture on your screen?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Makin&#x2019; sure Dixie&#x2019;s got the best bait on her hook, that&#x2019;s what.&#x201d; Margaret Louise nudged her chin in Rose&#x2019;s direction. &#x201c;Rose is Dixie&#x2019;s smarts. Beatrice is Dixie&#x2019;s quiet charm. And me? I make it sound as if she&#x2019;s a pro in the kitchen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah . . . that&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; Rose said, grabbing hold of Beatrice&#x2019;s upper arm with one hand while gesturing toward the screen with her other. &#x201c;Now, tell him I backpacked through Europe as a teenager and that I&#x2019;m considering doing it again!&#x201d;</p><p>Tori watched in horror as Beatrice nodded then typed Rose&#x2019;s words into the rapidly scrolling text box in the bottom-left-hand corner of the screen.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh! Oh! And be sure to add that I&#x2019;ll pack my backpack with an array of healthy homemade treats to share with other backpackers.&#x201d; Margaret Louise beamed as Beatrice made the addition. &#x201c;That way he gets domestic and charmin&#x2019; all at the same time!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you guys crazy? You can&#x2019;t do that! Dixie would be&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hello? Where is everybody?&#x201d; Dixie&#x2019;s voice rang out from the front of the house, kicking off a flurry of activity that had John&#x2019;s breathtaking blue eyes disappearing from the computer screen in a single blink of Tori&#x2019;s eye. Gone was the keyboard, the notebook with Dixie&#x2019;s user name and password for the senior online dating site, and the self-satisfied smiles from the faces of Tori&#x2019;s meddling friends.</p><p>A final check of the room for any remaining evidence of their misdeeds was followed by the scraping sound of Rose&#x2019;s chair as she pushed back and struggled to her feet with a rare burst of speed usually reserved for dessert time at the group&#x2019;s weekly sewing meeting.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re comin&#x2019;,&#x201d; Margaret Louise bellowed. Then, lowering her voice for the benefit of those in her study, she spoke around the side of her index finger. &#x201c;Now remember. Don&#x2019;t breathe a word.&#x201d;</p><p>For the second time in as many minutes, Tori opened her mouth to protest, only to have her second attempt at the same sentiment ripped from the air by Rose&#x2019;s bony elbow. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re young, Victoria. You&#x2019;re in love with a wonderful man. You don&#x2019;t know what it&#x2019;s like to be old and alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come tomorrow, when they finally meet over tea and scones, Dixie will be on her own,&#x201d; Beatrice whispered. &#x201c;This just gets them started.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Started in lies, you mean,&#x201d; Tori murmured before bringing up the rear of the parade that was now crossing the same toy-strewn room she&#x2019;d navigated like a world-class skier less than ten minutes earlier. What Rose, Beatrice, and Margaret Louise were doing was wrong. Setting Dixie up to meet John under such false pretenses was handicapping any chance the woman had at something real.</p><p>But any and all thoughts of calling the trio on the carpet disappeared the second Dixie came into view. She was standing beside her awkwardly large black carry-on with the most genuine look of childlike joy Tori had ever seen on her face.</p><p>Sure, she&#x2019;d seen Dixie smile while talking about books.</p><p>And yes, she&#x2019;d seen Dixie smile when lavished with praise for just about anything.</p><p>But the smile on her friend&#x2019;s face at that exact moment was different. It started with her mouth but it kept on going&#x2014;claiming the woman&#x2019;s eyes, cheeks, and virtually every other part of her five-foot-four, linebacker-like frame.</p><p>Was it really so terrible for Rose, Beatrice, and Margaret Louise to help Dixie along in an area where she&#x2019;d had no experience since losing her husband fifteen years earlier?</p><p>Yes. Because it&#x2019;s not real . . .</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, shut up.&#x201d;</p><p>Four sets of eyes beneath four sets of elevated eyebrows turned in Tori&#x2019;s direction.</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>She waved her hands back and forth. &#x201c;I&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t talking to any of you.&#x201d;</p><p>Rose scowled. &#x201c;No one else is here, Victoria.&#x201d;</p><p>A succession of loud thumps from just outside the front door saved her from having to admit she&#x2019;d been arguing with herself, and she was grateful. Right or wrong, Dixie&#x2019;s exuberant mood would make the flight to New York City easier on whoever pulled duty as her seatmate.</p><p>&#x201c;Would it be too much trouble for any of you to stop your endless chitchat long enough to assist me with my bags?&#x201d; Leona&#x2019;s perfectly made-up brown eyes peered through her stylish glasses at them from the other side of the screen door, an irritated expression marring her otherwise beautiful face.</p><p>She felt the weight of Leona&#x2019;s irritation as it moved across each and every face before landing squarely on hers. With a shot, Tori sprang into action. &#x201c;Oh. Sure. I can help.&#x201d; She stepped around her friends and through the door Leona held open with a bored hand, only to come to a statue-like freeze at the mountain of luggage atop Margaret Louise&#x2019;s front porch.</p><p>Her mouth gaped open.</p><p>Margaret Louise&#x2019;s fraternal twin shook her head of salon-softened gray hair. &#x201c;How many times have I told you not to let your jaw slack like that, dear? It&#x2019;s a very unbecoming look for anyone, let alone someone who does so little to enhance their features&#x2014;positive or otherwise.&#x201d;</p><p>She knew she should say something to defend herself, or at the very least, wait a beat or two until Rose could jump in and begin trading barbs with her biggest adversary, but she didn&#x2019;t. All she could focus on at that moment was the luggage.</p><p>Three bulging bags to be checked.</p><p>Four questionable-sized carry-ons.</p><p>And one very pampered garden-variety bunny with a bejeweled bow around her neck.</p><p>For a three-day trip.</p><p>&#x201c;Leona, you can&#x2019;t bring all those bags!&#x201d;</p><p>Instantly, Leona&#x2019;s chin rose into the air above Paris&#x2019;s soft, velvety ears. &#x201c;And why not?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because we want the plane to actually get off the runway?&#x201d; Rose quipped from her spot in the doorway between Beatrice and Margaret Louise.</p><p>Ever the mediator, Beatrice&#x2019;s voice, quiet and sweet, rushed to smooth the fight-inducing words. &#x201c;You look so lovely in everything you wear, Leona, I&#x2019;m most certain you don&#x2019;t need all of the things you packed.&#x201d;</p><p>Leona&#x2019;s anger-filled eyes left Rose just long enough to take in the British girl with a knowing nod before returning to her nemesis with flaring nostrils. &#x201c;I figured at least one of the two of us should dress like something other than a housecoat-wearing, feet-shuffling, backwoods-living bumpkin.&#x201d;</p><p>Silence permeated the air for all of about two seconds before Rose returned the volley. &#x201c;And you think a teeny-bopper-clothes-wearing, street-walking, man-hungry floozy is better?&#x201d;</p><p>Leona&#x2019;s mouth gaped, then recovered, then gaped again.</p><p>&#x201c;Pssst, Twin?&#x201d; Margaret Louise mock-whispered. &#x201c;I can see your partials when you do that.&#x201d;</p><p>Unable to hold it back any longer, Tori laughed, the tension brought on by her friends&#x2019; shenanigans regarding Dixie all but a distant memory against the promise of three fun-filled days in the Big Apple. The fact that the trip coincided with their appearance tomorrow on the nationally syndicated morning television sensation, Taped with Melly and Kenneth, only made it more exciting.</p><p>The death glare that had been aimed solely at Rose until that moment grew to include Tori as well. But before Leona could give words to her anger, Margaret Louise waved off the negative vibes. &#x201c;I got a call from Zelman this mornin&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Zelman?&#x201d; Beatrice asked.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the guy who makes sure that Melly and Kenneth&#x2019;s show goes off without a hitch each day.&#x201d; Margaret Louise pushed off the door frame and motioned everyone back inside. &#x201c;He said a limo will pick us up at the hotel at one o&#x2019;clock tomorrow afternoon and bring us to the studio.&#x201d;</p><p>Beatrice patted the purse draped over her arm. &#x201c;I have the picture of Georgina they requested.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I have one of Melissa, too.&#x201d; Margaret Louise unzipped the front of her own carry-on and reached into the side compartment, retrieving an eight-by-ten portrait of her daughter-in-law, her son, and her eight grandchildren, including Matthew, the twelve-week-old addition. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you just imagine all them oohs and ahhs when folks see this picture? Why, I&#x2019;m bettin&#x2019; the phones will be ringin&#x2019; off the hook at the studio with folks wantin&#x2019; to know more &#x2019;bout them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I sure wish Georgina and Melissa could come. It won&#x2019;t feel quite right without them being there.&#x201d;</p><p>Heads nodded around the room at Dixie&#x2019;s words but stopped as Tori reminded them of the reason Georgina Hayes&#x2014;the town&#x2019;s mayor&#x2014;and Melissa Davis couldn&#x2019;t attend. &#x201c;You know Georgina, she can&#x2019;t miss a town council meeting. And Matthew is too young for Melissa to leave behind, no matter how badly she wishes she could come.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;ll just have to make sure we tell them all about it,&#x201d; Rose said amid a sudden coughing fit.</p><p>Beatrice straightened up, waving a camera as she did. &#x201c;And show them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Look who I found out on the sidewalk looking all wistful!&#x201d;</p><p>All heads turned back toward the door, the sight of the final sewing circle member and her lone suitcase filling the doorway a nanosecond before yet another familiar face came into view just beyond Debbie Calhoun&#x2019;s shoulder.</p><p>Tori planted a warm kiss on her sewing sister&#x2019;s cheek then stepped into Milo Wentworth&#x2019;s waiting arms.</p><p>&#x201c;I came to see you off. I hope that&#x2019;s okay?&#x201d;</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t help but smile at the butterflies that still flapped in her stomach every time her fianc� was near. It was one of many signs that this time she&#x2019;d made the right choice in future husbands, after fin...</p></p><h2>Serving Humanity: A Compilation</h2><p>*Serving Humanity is an inspiring compilation that contains a wide collection of extracts from the 24 books by Alice A. Bailey. These extracts were chosen to stimulate thought and increase the reader&#39;s understanding of discipleship service and its vital importance to spiritual development. Chapters include extracts on: The Law of Service, Characteristics of the Server, The Service Rendered by Humanity, Purification of the Vehicles for Service, Old Age and Service, Training for Service and much more.</p><p>*Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master,and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching. A total of twenty-four books were written by Alice Bailey. These books constitute a continuation of the Ageless Wisdom, a body of esoteric teaching handed down from ancient times in a form which is always suitable to each period. Intended to precede and condition the New Age, the Alice Bailey books offer an unparalleled spiritual approach to the teaching on Shamballa and the Path of spiritual evolution; the spiritual Hierarchy; the new discipleship and training in meditation as a form of service; the teaching on the seven rays and the new psychology of the soul; and the common thread of truth linking all the major world faiths. In addition to her work as an author and lecturer, Alice Bailey established the Lucis Publishing Company, making the teachings of Djwhal Khul available to spiritual seekers and students around the world for over 75 years. Reprinting of the books is financed through a revolving Fund under the administration of the Lucis Trust, a non-profit organization also founded by Alice A. Bailey. No royalties are paid and copyrights are owned by the Lucis Trust. Through these organizations, Alice Bailey provided for the continued publication of these teachings beyond her physical lifetime.</p><h2>Holman New Testament Commentary - Hebrews &amp; James (Volume 10)</h2><p>One in a series of twelve New Testament verse-by-verse commentary books edited by Max Anders.

Spanning eras and generations, it tells of the lives of three unforgettable women: Miss May Belle, a wise healing woman; her precocious and observant daughter Rue, who is reluctant to follow in her mother&#x2019;s footsteps as a midwife; and their master&#x2019;s daughter Varina. The secrets and bonds among these women and their community come to a head at the beginning of a war and at the birth of an accursed child, who sets the townspeople alight with fear and a spreading superstition that threatens their newly won, tenuous freedom.<br> &nbsp;<br> Magnificently written, brilliantly researched, richly imagined, <i>Conjure Women</i> moves back and forth in time to tell the haunting story of Rue, Varina, and May Belle, their passions and friendships, and the lengths they will go to save themselves and those they love.<br><br><b>Advance praise for <i>Conjure Women</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Afia Atakora brings the Civil War South to life so beautifully with <i>Conjure Women,</i> a heartbreaking joy to read.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Martha Hall Kelly, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Lilac Girls</i></b></p><p><b>Afia Atakora</b> was born in the United Kingdom and raised in New Jersey, where she now lives.

Her fiction has been nominated for a Pushcart Prize and she was a finalist for the Hurston/Wright Award for College Writers.&#x201c;If you are grieving for Toni Morrison, Afia Atakora is the young writer to read now: the kind of historical novelist who makes you believe she must have somehow seen the places she describes and known these characters herself. Her astonishing debut takes the reader to a Reconstruction-era Southern plantation, where two little girls&#x2014;the enslaved child of the local healer and the planter&#x2019;s cloistered daughter&#x2014;become unlikely friends. <i>Conjure Women</i> illuminates an unfamiliar corner of Civil War history and brings to life an indelible character whose talents, from midwifery to voodoo, will yield her own unconventional path to power and freedom.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Nell Freudenberger, author of <i>Lost and Wanted</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This novel, written in lush, irresistible, and poetic prose, took me into the lives of people in another time and place&#x2014;into their loves, nightmares, dreams, their unexpected ties&#x2014;and into the hearts of women I could otherwise never know.

Caputo breaks down the name of God in this irrepressible book. Instead of looking at God as merely a name, Caputo views it as an event, or what the name conjures or promises in the future. For Caputo, the event exposes God as weak, unstable, and barely functional. While this view of God flies in the face of most religions and philosophies, it also puts up a serious challenge to fundamental tenets of theology and ontology. Along the way, Caputo&#x2019;s readings of the New Testament, especially of Paul&#x2019;s view of the Kingdom of God, help to support the "weak force" theory. This penetrating work cuts to the core of issues and questions&#x2015;What is the nature of God? What is the nature of being? What is the relationship between God and being? What is the meaning of forgiveness, faith, piety, or transcendence?&#x2015;that define the terrain of contemporary philosophy of religion.</p></p><p>2007 AAR Award for Excellence in the Study of Religion,Constructive-Reflective StudiesWinner, 2007 American Academy of Religion Award for Excellence in the Study of Religion, Constructive-Reflective Studies</p><h2>The Photographer&#39;s Mind Remastered: Creative Thinking for Better Digital Photos</h2><p><br>You've done your research.

A third of these are about photography, and you might think that&#x2019;s rather too many for one person to write. I mean, don&#x2019;t I have anything better to do? Valid question, but I like books--no, more than that, I have a strong belief in them--and as my work involves a lot of travelling, I have a great deal of time to think and write when I&#x2019;m on the road. In fact, I&#x2019;ve always spent a little more than half of each year travelling, and usually on long trips. Five or six weeks at a time is my ideal, though it&#x2019;s sometimes longer by necessity. This isn&#x2019;t packaged tourism, of course, and many of the places I&#x2019;m in are a little quieter and more remote than you might expect. Perfect for thinking about writing, and this writing is also about what I&#x2019;m doing--shooting. </p> <p>Two and a half years ago I published <i>The Photographer&#x2019;s Eye</i>, a book which at its core is about composition. This evolved from a much earlier book, long out of print. It always seemed to me that the word "technique" was usually being applied to the wrong things in photography. Technique was taken to mean twiddling knobs and working the controls, not to mention the arcana of imaging software. All very well, but what about the result? You could train yourself to fit a flash unit to the camera faster than a weapons expert could change magazines on a Kalashnikov, or learn to despise anyone who doesn&#x2019;t use Smart Objects in Photoshop, but if the image is boring at the end of it, what was the point? </p> <p> The techniques that always engaged me (and to be frank, most of the other professionals I know) have to do with image making, regardless of camera model or Photoshop version. My background is editorial assignment photography, usually features, so the pressure is always on to make the shot <i>interesting</i>. It&#x2019;s quite often about storytelling, and if I&#x2019;m trying to tell a part of that story clearly, I might (for instance) need to find a viewpoint and framing that relates one thing in the frame to another. Or, can I find a composition and scale that somehow encapsulates the mood and essence of the scene? Or, did another photographer I know already shoot this in a particular way, and how can I be different and better? </p> <p>Composition isn&#x2019;t about the Rule of Thirds (spare me, please!) and getting the framing perfect. There <i>is</i> no perfect. But neither is it vague and happy-feely. There are real techniques that involve knowing what the frame shape is doing to you, how the eye and mind tend to respond to visual stimuli, and how to create the right balance between surprise and comfort simply by the proportion you allocate to elements In the frame. And because these techniques involve choice of subject and being certain of what you&#x2019;re trying to achieve (for instance, make the scene lush and lovable, or shock the pants off the audience), composition reaches much, much further than placing points and lines in a rectangle. </p> <p>Well, if I go on much more, this will begin to be a book! And there already is one . . . it&#x2019;s the sequel to <i>The Photographer&#x2019;s Eye</i>, and it&#x2019;s called <i>The Photographer&#x2019;s Mind</i>. It exists because there was much more that I wanted to say than I was able to in <i>Eye.</i> </p> <p>There&#x2019;s even a little bit more that I couldn&#x2019;t fit into this, either. One thing I touch on in the book is the deep effect of frame shape, and in particular a new trend towards wider. 16:9 is rapidly gaining ground as a "natural" format (aspect ratio, actually) because of HDTV, and a few cameras offer this framing. And of course, its shape alone has an effect on composing that is noticeably different from 3:2 and 4:3.

Parrish - 96 pages. This book gives an overview of the scattering and regathering of the tribes. It is one of the most important books ever written on the topic of eschatology (extreme last days). This amazing 96-page study will be hard to put down once you begin reading it. It flows logically through Scripture, showing clearly that Israel was divided into two houses and the vast majority of Israel don&#39;t even know that they are. The extreme last days are here. The re-gathering of Israel occurs when Yahusha returns on the prophesied Day of Yahuah. The scattering of Israel was intentional (Amos 9:9). He Who scatters Israel will gather him, Jer. 31:10. Fishermen will be sent to gather them out of the nations where they were scattered (see Jer. 16:14-21). You will see that the secret of Alahim spoken of at Ephesians 3 and Revelation 10 are solved through an understanding of the Two Houses: the House of Israel, and the House of Yahudah. The houses are called two sisters at Jeremiah 3, but are also the two brothers referred to in the parable of the Prodigal Son. One brother went to PaganLand for a few thousand years, and the other brother stayed with the Torah, in the Father&#39;s House, keeping the Covenant, and having the sign of the Sabbath (Shabath).</p><p></p><h2>Organic Chemistry, Second Edition</h2><p>The Second Edition of Organic Chemistry maintains all the innovative features of the first edition in a sleeker, slimmer, and easier-to-navigate design. Hailed by J Chem Ed as &#x201c;the new wave&#x201d; in organic textbooks, this book&#x2019;s mechanistic approach constructs organic chemistry from the ground up. By focusing on the points of reactivities in organic, this text allows students to approach more and more complex molecules with enhanced understanding. Also noteworthy are the biochemical examples for their variety, substance, and depth. Despite its unique emphasis on reactivity, the book facilitates easy adoption by covering organic compound classes in the traditional order. Hundreds of worked examples and student exercises combine with clear writing and sound pedagogy to make this text an exceptional choice. What's New in this Edition? a sleeker, slimmer volume improved organization designed for ease of use more examples and solved exercises fewer specialized topics the first chapter on nucleophilic substitution has been expanded and divided into two chapters, allowing alkyl halides and alcohol substitution reactions to be treated separately oxidation reactions of alcohols have been removed from the chapter on elimination reactions, and a separate chapter on reduction and oxidation reactions has been created (Chapter 11), which also includes discussions about the reduction and oxidation reactions of alkenes the chemistry of dienes, including the Diels-Alder reaction, have been collected in a chapter separate from the one devoted to the addition reactions of simple alkenes the order of topics in the chapters presenting spectroscopic methods has been reversed, so nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is now covered first the chapter that introduces synthetic methods has been largely preserved from the first edition, but it is followed directly by the chapter on enantioselective synthesis the discussion of enantioselective reactions has been completely rewritten, and its emphasis has been changed to encourage students to think about designing enantioselective syntheses without having to memorize a lot of details about specific reagents and conditions the topic of aromatic compounds&#x2014; benzene and its derivatives&#x2014;has been moved, and the presentations about diazonium compounds and nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, have been incorporated into new Chapter 17 the chapter about about aldehydes, ketones, and carbohydrates has been divided into two chapters in the current edition, with the division made according to the reaction mechanisms involved, not according to the functional groups that are undergoing the reactions the chapter on nitrogen-containing compounds has been parceled in this edition among several chapters in the new edition in contrast, the discussions of polymer chemistry, which were interspersed throughout the book in the first edition, have been collected to form Chapter 26 in this edition</p><p>New to this edition: *a sleeker, slimmer volume *improved organization designed for ease of use *more examples and solved exercises *fewer specialized topicsThomas Sorrell received a BA in chemistry from New College (Sarasota, FL) 1973 and a PhD in organic chemistry from Stanford University in 1977.

What was in the evangelical teaching that excited, moved or persuaded them? Andrew Pettegree tackles these questions directly by re-examining the reasons that moved millions to this decisive and traumatic break with a shared Christian past. He charts the separation from family, friends, and workmates that adherence to the new faith often entailed and the new solidarities that emerged in their place. He explores the different media of conversion through which the Reformation message was communicated and the role of drama, sermons, song and the book. His findings offer a persuasive new answer to the critical question of how the Reformation could succeed as a mass movement in an age before mass literacy.</p><p>Why did people choose the Reformation?

Struggling for his life in his lonely world, he soon learned to follow the harsh law of the North -- kill or be killed. But nothing prepared him for the challenges to come. After being turned into a vicious killer forced to fight for money, White Fang must find a way to return to humanity.

White Fang is part wolf, part dog, a ferocious and magnificent creature through whose experiences we see and feel essential rhythms and patterns of life in the animal kingdom and among mankind as well.<br>It is, above all, a novel that keenly observes the extraordinary working of one of nature's greatest gifts to its creatures: the power to adapt.</p><p></p></p><h2>STORYBOOK # 1 SECOND EDITION SING SPELL READ AND WRITE</h2><p><p><strong>Sing, Spell, Read &amp; Write</strong> is a phonics-based program that uses a 36-step program of carefully sequenced steps to teach reading, writing, and spelling.

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic.<br></p><p>The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty--and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition--in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information.</p><br><p><i>Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems</i> will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability.</p></p><p>By Judea Pearl</p><h2>The Human Rights Reader: Major Political Essays, Speeches and Documents From Ancient Times to the Present</h2><p><p>The second edition of <em>The Human Rights Reader</em> presents a dramatically revised organization and updated selections, including pieces on globalization and the war on terrorism.

This edition is the most comprehensive and up-to-date collection of essays, speeches, and documents from historical and contemporary sources, all of which are now placed in context with Micheline Ishay&#x2019;s substantial introduction to the reader as a whole and valuable introductions to each part and chapter.</p></p><p><p><strong>Micheline Ishay</strong> is Professor at the Joesph Korbel School of International Studies&nbsp;at University of Denver, where she is Director of the human rights program.

Are human rights Western impositions or universal values? Does globalization advance or undermine them? Do they originate in or constrain religion? Are they the product of socialism or among its victims? Did the anti-colonial movement respond to repression or simply shift its source?

It is a crucial contribution that lends support to the universalist claim that the struggle for human rights is not time/space specific, but rather one that, like human existance, transcends time and space and is part of a larger movement to protect and ensure the emancipation of all.

Each of the Smarts<i>&#x2014;</i>parents Eve and Michael, son Magnus, and the youngest, daughter Astrid<i>&#x2014;</i>encounter Amber in his or her own solipsistic way, but somehow her presence allows them to see their lives (and their life together) in a new light. Smith&#x2019;s narrative freedom and&nbsp;exhilarating facility with language propel the novel to its startling, wonderfully enigmatic conclusion.</p></p><p>Before writing <i>The Accidental</i>, Ali Smith wrote <i>Hotel World</i>, shortlisted for both the Orange Prize and the Man Booker Prize, and several short story collections. Her work is absolutely original, with a trademark quirky style, with whole passages that seem to have been bound into the wrong book and occasional historical asides completely outside the narrative line. Don't be fooled; with Smith, every word has a purpose. <p> Amber is the catalyst who makes the novel happen. She appears on the doorstep of the Smart's rented summer cottage in Norfolk, England, barefoot and unexpected. Eve Smart, a third-rate author suffering writer's block, believes that she is a friend of her husband's. Michael is a womanizing University professor, but he doesn't usually drag his quarry home. He thinks that she must be a friend of Eve's. Everyone is politely confused and Amber is invited to dinner. She is a consummate liar and manipulator who manages to seduce everyone in the family in some significant way. </p><p> Magnus, Eve's 17-year-old son from a former marriage and Astrid, her 12-year-old daughter, are easy prey. Magnus is in despair. He played a prank on a classmate and it went horribly wrong when she killed herself because of the humiliation it caused. He cannot shake the guilt and is about to hang himself from the shower rod when Amber walks into the bathroom, the perfect deus ex machina. She bathes him and takes him back downstairs, announcing that she found him trying to kill himself. Everyone titters. Could it be possible? This is a recurring question as Amber's behavior becomes more and more outrageous. Is this really happening, or is it some family-wide delusion? To add to the mystery, there is a Rashomon-like character to the story in that the same events are recalled by the Smarts through their own filters. </p><p> This is a completely engrossing novel that raises as many questions as it answers. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p><p>Ali Smith&nbsp;is the author of many works of fiction, including the novel&nbsp;<i>Hotel World, </i>which was short-listed for both the Orange Prize and the Booker Prize and won the Encore Award and the Scottish Arts Council Book of the Year Award, and&nbsp;<i>The Accidental,</i>&nbsp;which won the Whitbread Award and was short-listed for the Man Booker Prize and the Orange Prize.

Many individuals who experience health issues related to dairy food consumption have found that wheat and gluten are also contributing factors, myself not withstanding. Although I had discovered my dairy allergy, it wasn&#x2019;t until several years later that I learned I was also intolerant to wheat and gluten. To better understand what it means to be gluten intolerant and eliminate it from your diet, I&#x2019;ve added a section on gluten to the introduction that addresses this growing concern and its impact on diet-related health issues.<br><br> In this edition, each recipe is not only dairy-free but also 100 percent wheat- and gluten-free! But I didn&#x2019;t stop there. Recognizing that many people who experience food intolerances may also face multiple food allergies, I&#x2019;ve included at the top of each recipe, a coding system that indicates other common allergens the recipe is free of.<b> If you see an asterisk next to an ingredient, it&#x2019;s simply alerting you that the ingredient may be replaced with other options. For example, if you see an asterisk next to soy yogurt* in an ingredients list, and you have a sensitivity to soy products, this indicates that soy yogurt can be replaced with rice or almond yogurt to make the recipe soy-free.<br></b><br> Furthermore, each recipe has been reformulated to reduce unnecessary oils and refined sweeteners without compromising flavor. The expanded Basics section is the backbone for many of the recipes in this book and is where you will find the master gluten-free flour mix (page 172), instructions for making your own nondairy nut milk (page 173), and nut cheese (page 175). You will also find new recipes in every chapter, photos for inspiration, and an updated listing of manufacturers, distributors, and other resources. <br><br><i> The Dairy-Free &amp; Gluten-Free Kitchen</i> provides the basic information you need to manage your dairy- and gluten-free decisions and offers a collection of delicious recipes&#x2014;prepared with accessible ingredients&#x2014;that will make implementing a dairy- and gluten-free diet effortless. <br><br> I&#x2019;d like to extend my sincere appreciation to all of my readers and clients for sharing your food intolerance discoveries over the years&#x2014;each of you has given me the inspiration for updating and revising <i>Recipes for Dairy-Free Living</i> and bringing you this second edition. Thank you and enjoy!<br> &nbsp;<br><b> Understanding Dairy Issues<br></b><br> Dairy products and their isolated constituents come in many forms and are in more foods than you might realize. The extracted protein, fat, and sugar from dairy have many different uses in food manufacturing and are used to lend texture, structure, and flavor to so many everyday foods. Beyond the obvious items in the dairy case, many other products contain dairy in the form of lactose or milk proteins. One example is a dairy protein called casein that is often added to milk-alternative cheeses to enable the cheese to melt. In addition to various processed food items, dairy components are also used in pharmaceutical drugs sold both over the counter and by prescription. So the first step in implementing a dairy-free lifestyle is to have a basic understanding of what dairy is and how it can affect us.<br><br> <i>Lactose Intolerance<br></i><br> Although the terms <i>lactose intolerance</i> and <i>dairy allergy</i> are often used interchangeably, they engage very different body processes. Lactose is milk sugar, a carbohydrate, which occurs naturally in the milk of animals. Many people are intolerant to milk products because they lack the enzyme called lactase. This enzyme, found in the gastrointestinal tract, is critical in the digestion of lactose. If the lactase enzyme is missing or depleted, the gastrointestinal tract cannot adequately break down the milk sugar, leading to a wide variety of symptoms. Individuals experiencing this are described as being <i>lactose intolerant</i>. <br><br> The symptoms of lactose intolerance can vary greatly from one individual to the next as well as varying within the individual. They include, but are not limited to, stomach cramps, bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea. It&#x2019;s difficult to estimate how many people are lactose intolerant. However, it is estimated that up to fifty million Americans suffer from some form of dairy intolerance. The condition encompasses many ethnic groups; age also plays a major role in the ability to tolerate dairy products. As we mature, our body&#x2019;s ability to produce the lactase enzyme in our gastrointestinal tract begins to diminish. That is why lactose intolerance can intensify with age. Tolerance is dependent upon the amount of lactase in each individual&#x2019;s system and the amount of dairy products ingested at any given time. Think of it this way: If you have a limited amount of lactase enzyme in your gastrointestinal tract and you ingest limited amounts of dairy, your body may be able to break the lactose down on its own. However, if you have a limited amount of lactase enzyme available and you ingest moderate to high amounts of dairy, you will have exceeded your body&#x2019;s capacity to digest the lactose and thus will experience symptoms. <br><br> Unfortunately, there is no way to establish what constitutes limited, moderate, and high dairy intake, because it is completely individualized. To some people, limited amounts of dairy can translate to milk on their cereal in the morning, yogurt in the afternoon, and pasta with Parmesan cheese for dinner. For others this amount of dairy would be considered high or excessive. And some people could tolerate this amount of dairy only if they avoided dairy products entirely for the next several days. <br><br> Many people who are strictly lactose intolerant can avoid problems simply by taking a dairy digestive aid. These digestive aids are widely available and can be purchased over the counter at supermarkets, drugstores, and specialty stores. The amount of lactase enzyme you will require will depend on how much dairy you ingest and how much lactase is already present in your gastrointestinal tract. Select a product that has the right amount of FCC lactase units to complement your digestive tract. For example, when comparing various products I found that the suggested dosage could vary drastically from one product to the next, with one brand containing 9,000 FCC lactase units per caplet and another containing only 1,000. <br><br> <i>Milk Proteins and Allergy<br></i><br> Milk proteins come in many different forms, several with names that are difficult to pronounce. The important thing is to be able to recognize them when they appear on a label. The main ones to look for are casein and whey, but proteins can also be identified as hydrolysates, caseinates, lactalbumin, and lactoglobulin. All of these are milk proteins.<br><br> As with the symptoms of lactose intolerance, reactions to milk proteins can vary greatly from one individual to the next. Reaction to milk proteins is regarded as a food or dairy allergy. It is important to understand that a food allergy triggers an immune system response to compounds, in this case proteins, in an offending food. It is caused by an allergic antibody called IgE (Immunoglobulin E). However, it is significant to note that it is possible to be both lactose intolerant and develop a food allergy to dairy proteins. <br><br> Symptoms of dairy allergy tend to range in severity from digestive issues including: stomach cramps, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, constipation, bleeding from the bowel, rectal fissures, and itching, to respiratory problems, such as asthma, sinus and lung congestion, ear aches, itchy and watery eyes, skin rash, hives, and eczema. And possible behavioral problems, including migraine headaches, fatigue, brain fog, irritability, and anxiety. If you suspect that you may have a dairy allergy, seek out a medical professional specializing in food allergies, a nutritionist, or naturopath, who can help you understand and manage your condition.

So, when dairy is no longer an option in our diet, we need to find alternative ways to fulfill our daily calcium requirement. Calcium rich foods are plentiful in the plant kingdom, particularly in vegetables, legumes, grains, nuts, seeds, and, yes, even fruit. I was quite surprised to find how many calcium-rich foods I was already eating as part of my normal diet. But the question remained, was I getting enough calcium? To be sure that I would get the calcium my body needed, my doctor recommended that I take a calcium with magnesium supplement, along with vitamin D. She emphasized that I increase the amount of plant-based foods in my diet and that the supplements were simply an insurance policy. <br><br> As to which type of calcium supplement works best, Calcium Carbonate or Calcium Citrate both are good. Calcium carbonate is inexpensive but should be taken with an acidic beverage for best utilization. Calcium Citrate is a bit more expensive but is more easily absorbed, particularly for individuals taking any type of acid blockers. Daily calcium requirements vary; check with your doctor to be sure you&#x2019;re at the correct level. When you understand the role calcium plays in your overall health and you know which foods are high in calcium, making an informed decision on how you will meet your daily calcium requirement becomes a lot easier. To find out more, I turned to Kazuko Aoyagi, an expert on the subject of diet, nutrition, and exercise.<br><br> <i>Calcium 101 by Kazuko Aoyagi<br></i><br> Most people know that calcium is a mineral necessary for forming and maintaining healthy bones and teeth. However, few people realize that calcium also plays an important role in regulating other body functions, including:<br> &nbsp;<br> blood clotting <br> blood pressure <br> enzyme activation <br> contraction and relaxation of muscles (including normal heartbeats) <br> nerve transmission <br> cell membrane permeability (allowing fluids and other materials to pass in and out of cells)<br> &nbsp;<br> About 98 percent of the calcium in our body is stored in our bones. When there is not enough calcium present in the diet, calcium is &#x201c;borrowed&#x201d; from the bones and released into the bloodstream to maintain these essential body functions. Symptoms of calcium deficiency include osteoporosis, rickets, and impaired muscle contraction (muscle cramps). Over time, dietary calcium deficiency can lead to a loss of bone density, resulting in osteoporosis. However, there is still much debate over whether a lack of dietary calcium is the main cause of loss of bone density. Although dairy foods are often touted as a way to build strong bones, there has never been a study that conclusively links the consumption of dairy products to bone health. <br> &nbsp;<br><b>Factors Contributing to Healthy Bones <br></b><br> Osteoporosis, or the thinning of the bones, is often associated with older people, but the process can start earlier than you might expect. Peak bone mass is achieved by age twenty-five, so it is important to build strong bones as a youth. After age twenty-five, bone mass replenishment slows, and maintaining bone mass becomes increasingly important. Once bones begin to thin, it is hard to reverse the trend with calcium alone. Many factors, such as diet, exercise, medications, hormones, heredity, and lifestyle choices, can influence both the development of bone density and the ability to maintain bone density during the aging process. <br><br><b> Diet.</b> Bones require a wide variety of nutrients to develop normally and to maintain density after maturity. Simply getting the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of calcium is not enough to keep your bones healthy. Vitamins and minerals, along with proper nutrition, all play a major role. The key nutrients include protein, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, boron, manganese, copper, vitamin D, vitamin C, and vitamin K. <br><br> Magnesium is especially important, as it is necessary for transporting calcium to the bones. Consuming gallons of milk or taking hundreds of calcium pills will do no good without the presence of magnesium and other elements and minerals. Ironically, drinking too much milk or taking a large dose of calcium supplements can actually cause a calcium imbalance because milk does not contain enough magnesium. <br><br><b> Calcium Absorption.</b> Calcium balance in adults is complex because your body does not absorb all of the calcium you ingest. Once you have met the RDA for calcium of 1,000 milligrams, your body will absorb only what it needs and excrete the rest. Phytates, found in grains, and oxalates, found in green leafy vegetables, reduce the body&#x2019;s ability to absorb calcium somewhat by binding to the calcium so that it cannot be absorbed efficiently. However, recent studies have shown that the amount of fiber, phytates, and oxalates found in the average American diet do not appear to pose a problem for calcium absorption. Research also revealed that vegetarian diets provide adequate amounts of calcium, as measured by body stores.<br><br><b> Exercise.</b> Weight-bearing exercise stimulates bone formation and helps build and maintain strong bones. Thin bones become a major problem when muscles weaken significantly and when bones aren&#x2019;t challenged with weight. A study conducted by NASA showed that weightlessness in space decreased skeletal density in humans and primates by as much as 10 percent. Unfortunately, as we age, most of us become less physically active and the amount of weight-bearing exercise in our daily routine diminishes. <br><br><b> Medications and Hormones.</b> Some medications can actually inhibit the amount of calcium absorbed from food by increasing the calcium lost through the kidneys. One example is a commonly used asthma medication containing corticosteroids. Corticosteroids may also interfere with the production of sex hormones in both men and women, which can contribute to a decrease in bone density. The level of gonadal hormones (estrogen for women and testosterone for men) also appears to regulate bone mass by influencing the absorption of calcium in the intestines. If you are taking medications, you should discuss your nutritional concerns with your doctor. <br><br><b> Heredity and Lifestyle.</b> Lactase deficiency is particularly common among North American African Americans, Asians, Mexicans, Native Americans, and people of Mediterranean or Hispanic origin. In most people, it appears to be an acquired rather than inherited disorder, sometimes beginning after a viral or bacterial infection or other disorder of the gut. Lifestyle choices, such as cigarettes, alcohol, and a high sodium intake and animal proteins can also contribute to calcuim loss.

One had a pair of glasses perched on her nose and her pet tarantula, Violet, perched on her head. In each hand she held a piece of thin wire that she was gradually--and very carefully--bringing closer together. The other was watching, breath held, and trying not to get in the way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Steady,&#x201d; said the first girl, her dark eyes fixed on the gap between the wires. &#x201c;Almost there . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately her friend--lost in admiration for the science taking place before her very eyes--chose just that moment to nudge some glassware with an unwary elbow and a round-bottomed beaker crashed to the floor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was a sudden spark as the wires the first girl had been holding met unexpectedly quickly, followed by a babble of apology from the other, who was already dropping to her knees to collect the shards of broken glass.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry!&#x201d; she said for the tenth time in as many seconds. &#x201c;I really am! I didn&#x2019;t mean to, Tess, I swear.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess sighed before joining her friend on the floor. &#x201c;I know, Wilf. Your timing is perfect, though. As usual.&#x201d; She picked up the larger pieces of beaker with the skill that comes from long practice; Wilf averaged two breakages a week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wilf--who had discarded her given name, Wilhelmina, as soon as she was old enough to say it and long before she was old enough to know how to spell it--reddened. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m never going to be a scientist if I can&#x2019;t stop destroying my equipment,&#x201d; she muttered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess looked at her friend. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly, you goose,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re already a scientist. Just think of it as a study of gravity. Or,&#x201d; she continued, holding up a shard and peering through it, &#x201c;an examination of the smashiness of glass.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not a word,&#x201d; Wilf scoffed, though her green eyes shone with amusement in her pale face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I just said it, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d; Tess retorted, placing the shard carefully in her palm. As she reached for the next piece, her tarantula stirred on her head. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up, girl?&#x201d; she murmured, glancing upward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Is something wrong?&#x201d; asked Wilf, but before Tess had a chance to answer, the door to their &#x201c;lab&#x201d; was opened. Tess felt Violet relax, settling back into the tangle of Tess&#x2019;s hair.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Girls?&#x201d; came a voice they both knew.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Miss Whipstead,&#x201d; Wilf said, getting to her feet. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re down here.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah. Wilhelmina. Another breakage?&#x201d; their teacher said with a fond smile.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Just a small one,&#x201d; Wilf replied, blushing again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Never mind, eh?&#x201d; Miss Whipstead said, throwing her a wink. &#x201c;Now, Tess? Miss Ackerbee needs you upstairs.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess clambered to her feet. Violet began to thrum a bit, sensing her worry. &#x201c;Miss Ackerbee needs to see me?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;As I said. Can you come now, please? It&#x2019;s a bit of an emergency. Leave that clearing up to Wilf--I&#x2019;ll come and give her a hand in a minute.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;An emergency?&#x201d; Tess echoed. She took off her lab coat (really an old raincoat that she liked to imagine was white and that was equipped with many very useful pockets) and threw it over a nearby chair. Then she closed her experiments notebook, which had been sitting open on her workbench (really a spare classroom desk used mainly for detention), and folded it in two before sliding it into one of those very useful pockets. Violet skittered about a bit on top of her head. &#x201c;Shush, girl. It&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; Tess muttered to her, reaching up a finger for the spider to cling to. She met Wilf&#x2019;s worried gaze and tried to give her a reassuring smile.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Is there anything I can do to help?&#x201d; Wilf asked. Miss Whipstead glanced at her and shook her head.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Miss Ackerbee just needs Tess for now, Wilf. Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; she lied in a too-bright voice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;See you later,&#x201d; Tess said, giving Wilf&#x2019;s arm a quick squeeze as she passed. Wilf nodded, frowning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing to worry about, girls,&#x201d; said Miss Whipstead, holding the door open as Tess and Violet ducked under her arm. She glanced back at Wilf as they left the room. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be back to your experiments in no time, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d; Wilf sighed, turning back to the clear-up as her teacher closed the door.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know we&#x2019;re this close to doing it?&#x201d; said Tess, turning to Miss Whipstead wide-eyed. The teacher smiled, even as she shooed Tess up the corridor. &#x201c;Actually making a faradic spark--real electricity--from seaweed!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;If anyone can do it, it&#x2019;s you pair,&#x201d; said Miss Whipstead. &#x201c;I have no doubt.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What does Miss Ackerbee need me for?&#x201d; Tess racked her brain quickly, trying to see if there was anything she&#x2019;d done recently that she hadn&#x2019;t yet owned up to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s nothing,&#x201d; Miss Whipstead reassured her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not in trouble is all I know. Though goodness knows you ought to be.&#x201d; Tess glanced up at her, but the teacher&#x2019;s eyes twinkled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They climbed the basement stairs into the house&#x2019;s large kitchen and Miss Whipstead paused for a minute to evaluate Tess&#x2019;s appearance. After telling her to clean her glasses, wipe her breakfast off her face and pull up that one sock that insisted on slipping down, Miss Whipstead deemed Tess fit to appear in the parlor. &#x201c;Remember,&#x201d; whispered Miss Whipstead as she knocked on Miss Ackerbee&#x2019;s door. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not in trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Tess replied, smiling up at her. Then she stepped through into Miss Ackerbee&#x2019;s domain, feeling knock-kneed. There wasn&#x2019;t often cause to stand in this room, and Tess found it was rarely a good thing for anyone to be summoned before the housemistress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Tess,&#x201d; said Miss Ackerbee, turning from a tall filing cabinet in the corner. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you take a seat.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess did as she was asked, feeling somehow untethered, like she could just float right up into the corner of this tall room. She glanced out of the window, hoping that would help to keep her steady.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Now.&#x201d; Miss Ackerbee sat behind her desk. A short stack of paperwork topped with a blanket was within her reach. She folded her thin brown hands and took in a deep breath. &#x201c;I suppose I&#x2019;d best begin in the most obvious place. A man came for you today, Tess. A man who has laid claim to you and wants to take you away from here.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess swayed in her chair. She grasped its arms, fearing she might fall headlong onto the carpet otherwise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;My--my father?&#x201d; she croaked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miss Ackerbee shook her head, closing her eyes momentarily. &#x201c;No. I don&#x2019;t believe so. In fact, I don&#x2019;t believe he is any relation to you, despite his assertions to the contrary.&#x201d; Tess listened, hauling breaths in and out, hoping she wouldn&#x2019;t be sick. Violet reached down a forelimb to stroke her forehead and she began to calm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So--who was he?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Before we get to that, Tess, let&#x2019;s have a chat. Have I ever told you properly about the night you arrived here?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you said I was found in a blanket, on the doorstep . . .&#x201d; Tess&#x2019;s words trailed away as her eyes found the blanket on Miss Ackerbee&#x2019;s desk again. &#x201c;That blanket?&#x201d; She looked up at the housemistress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This blanket,&#x201d; Miss Ackerbee replied. &#x201c;And it contained more than just you, though you were gift enough by yourself.&#x201d; She smiled at Tess, who was too overwhelmed to return the smile. &#x201c;There was an envelope full of money, which was useless as it was in a currency nobody had ever seen. And there was this.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miss Ackerbee&#x2019;s hand slipped between the folds of the blanket. When it reemerged, it was clutching an object small enough to nestle in the hollow of her palm. The object was made of metal but Tess couldn&#x2019;t have said what sort--it looked dark, like brass. It was a short cylindrical thing like you might keep buttons in, though it was far too elegant for that, and the swirling weblike pattern that swept across it made it look like something that had been grown, not made. There were markings around its upper circumference, a bit like those on a clock face to denote the hours, or a compass to indicate direction, except there were eight of them. Each was a different color and one seemed to be discolored or tarnished somehow. It looked out of place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Is it--is it for false eyeballs?&#x201d; said Tess, her gaze fixed on the small metal box.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miss Ackerbee froze. &#x201c;I beg your pardon?&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just something I read once. A man kept his false eyeball in a tin exactly like that one.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miss Ackerbee&#x2019;s lips twitched. &#x201c;I have no idea what this object is, Tess, but as far as I&#x2019;m aware, it has nothing to do with eyeballs of any sort.&#x201d; She paused to place it on the table in front of her. &#x201c;And remind me to monitor your reading material a bit more closely,&#x201d; she murmured, sliding the box toward Tess.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So--what is it?&#x201d; said Tess, who hadn&#x2019;t moved from her chair.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I made a thorough examination of it when you arrived here,&#x201d; said Miss Ackerbee. &#x201c;In case there was a clue to your identity or your family. But when I discovered I had no idea what I was looking at, I put it away and it&#x2019;s been in that filing cabinet for the past twelve years.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And why are you giving it to me now?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I had intended to give it to you when you reached eighteen, or as soon as you decided to move away from this house to forge your own life,&#x201d; said Miss Ackerbee. &#x201c;Along with every last note of the money we found with you, in the hope you could make use of it somewhere. But that&#x2019;s just the problem.&#x201d; Miss Ackerbee sighed, taking off her spectacles to rub at her eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What--what is?&#x201d; said Tess after a minute.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;My dear, I don&#x2019;t quite know how to put this.&#x201d; Miss Ackerbee kept her eyes shut as she paused to think. Eventually she opened them again to gaze at Tess. &#x201c;It is my considered opinion that neither you, nor the money you arrived with, nor indeed this object, comes from anywhere on this earth,&#x201d; she finally said, settling her spectacles back on her nose and fixing Tess with a look that was, given the circumstances, surprisingly calm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess gaped at the object on Miss Ackerbee&#x2019;s desk as Violet trembled in the midst of her hair. She wanted nothing more than to get up, walk out of the room, run up the two flights of stairs to her own snug dormitory and pull her blankets over her head.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t . . . ,&#x201d; she finally managed to say, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you mean.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;My girl, I hardly know what I mean myself,&#x201d; said Miss Ackerbee with a sigh. &#x201c;All I know is this object is somehow inextricably tied with you, and that you are an extraordinary girl. A most extraordinary girl indeed.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Am I?&#x201d; Tess was dazed. She&#x2019;d never imagined she was extraordinary, and wondered how extraordinary people were supposed to act. Probably, she thought, they weren&#x2019;t supposed to go about with one sock down and their glasses smudged, and she wondered if Miss Ackerbee mightn&#x2019;t be mixing her up with one of the older girls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then Miss Ackerbee began to speak again and Tess did her best to focus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;When you were very little, Tess, you used to disappear. Just--vanish, like that, out of the blue. You&#x2019;d only be gone for five or maybe ten seconds at a time, but it was enough to make my heart skip.&#x201d; Miss Ackerbee gazed at her with steady brown eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess blinked at her. &#x201c;Um. Miss Ackerbee, I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Possible?&#x201d; Miss Ackerbee finished Tess&#x2019;s sentence. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think so either. Not until I met you, at least.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;But where did I go?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miss Ackerbee licked her lips and took a deep breath. She stared at her desk and it looked to Tess like she was trying to find a pattern in the swirl of knots in the wood. Finally she looked up. Her kind face was earnest, as though she hoped Tess would believe what she was about to tell her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The night you came to us, I was here. In this parlor. Drinking a cup of cocoa. The entire house was asleep and I was standing by my window, gazing out at the river and indulging in a bit of thought.&#x201d; She smiled at the memory. &#x201c;And then, out of the blue, a shimmering circle appeared in midair--just for a second, you understand. Had I blinked at the wrong moment, I would have missed it. It hung right in front of the door before winking out of existence again. But it was there long enough for me to see.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;See what?&#x201d; Tess asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A man. Young and thin, and frightened. He looked up at the door of Ackerbee&#x2019;s. Snow was falling all around him. And then he was gone. The next thing I knew, there was a wail. I put my cup down on the windowsill and ran to the door--and there you were in the porch, wrapped in this blanket.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And where was the man?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miss Ackerbee smiled, but there was sadness beneath it. &#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t there, Tess. And all around you was snow, tiny flakes in your blanket and even one on your baby eyelash, which I wiped away.&#x201d; Miss Ackerbee rubbed her forefinger with her thumb, as though reliving the moment. &#x201c;Except it wasn&#x2019;t snowing that night. Not in this world, at least.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess fought to understand. &#x201c;You said that before--&#x2018;this world.&#x2019; What does that mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I think,&#x201d; Miss Ackerbee began, speaking carefully, &#x201c;that you have the ability to move between our world and other worlds, Tess. I&#x2019;m not sure how, but that&#x2019;s my theory.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Other--other worlds?&#x201d; Tess scrunched up her face. &#x201c;Like--different planets?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t think so. Other versions of this planet is what I mean. Different realities might be a better way of putting it, perhaps.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miss Ackerbee lifted the blanket off the pile of paperwork, opened the topmost folder and began to flip through some documents until she came to a collection of letters, speaking to Tess all the while. &#x201c;When you were very small and your extraordinary abilities began to appear, I made some discreet inquiries of a scientific nature. Over the course of making those inquiries, I made a friend who, until a few years ago, was a professor of physics in a university in Ostravica.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She glanced at Tess and smiled. &#x201c;Several years ago he wrote to me about an idea he was working on, something he was calling the many-worlds theory, which basically means, as far as I understand, that all possible versions of our world might exist simultaneously. They don&#x2019;t interact because they can&#x2019;t--or at least that was his thinking at the time.&#x201d;<br><br></p></p><h2>In The Age Of The Smart Machine: The Future Of Work And Power</h2><p>A noted Harvard social scientist documents the pitfalls and promises of computerized technology in business life.</p><p>Drawing on in-depth interviews with workers and managers in various industries, these two authors illustrate the impact automation will have on those using computers in the work place. Each expresses deep concern about how the ability to monitor employees electronically may be abused. The similarity ends here. Garson (a playwright) shows concern about the dehumanizing effect of computer instruction. She cites examples of how computer monitoring is being abused, and finds little that will change the direction computer use is taking in creating an electronic sweatshop. Zuboff (Harvard) sees this development as a turning point in history. We can either use computers to dehumanize the work place and take from people the gratification they get from work (Garson's feeling), or we can "informate" workers (Zuboff's term), i.e. give them the knowledge to make human judgments that can enhance productivity. Zuboff believes computers can be used humanely to create better jobs, but she also recognizes the risks. The Electronic Sweatshop is a popularly written view of the negative aspects of computers in the work place. In the Age of the Smart Machine is a scholarly look at the impact, positive and negative, of computers in organizations. Both deal with a growing concern of management and labor. If only one can be purchased, Zuboff's is the better choice. Michael D. Kathman, St. John's Univ. Lib., Collegeville, Minn.<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Zuboff asserts that the computer is paving the way for a redistribution of authority in the workplace. "Geared to managers and information-systems experts, her findings, though ponderously written, will be of value to those who want to get the most knowledge and power from computerization," said PW. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The 7 Principles of an Evangelistic Life</h2><p>Just hearing the word 'evangelism' stirs emotions in believers and unbelievers alike. Because of this, many shy away from the topic altogether. Douglas Cecil believes we must bring a sense of balance into our approach to evangelism. <i>The 7 Principles of an Evangelistic Life</i> is not another book on evangelism methods;&nbsp;instead the&nbsp;author focuses on helping believers develop a lifestyle of evangelism that relies completely on the Holy Spirit. Evangelism is a spiritual adventure, and readers will be challenged to re-think how they live it out.<br></p><p><b>DOUGLAS CECIL</b> (B.A., University of Cincinnati; Th.M., and D.Min., Dallas Theological Seminary) currently serves as a life stages pastor at Christ Chapel Bible Church in Fort Worth, Texas.

The desire to find and somehow capture or protect the &#39;authentic&#39; narrative, art object, or ceremonial dance is hardly new. In this masterful examination of German and American folklore studies from the eighteenth century to the present, Regina Bendix demonstrates that the longing for authenticity remains deeply implicated in scholarly approaches to cultural analysis. Searches for authenticity, Bendix contends, have been a constant companion to the feelings of loss inherent in modernization, forever upholding a belief in a pristine yet endangered cultural essence and fueling cultural nationalism worldwide. Beginning with precursors of Herder and Emerson and the &#39;discovery&#39; of the authentic in expressive culture and literature, she traces the different, albeit intertwined, histories of German Volkskunde and American folklore studies. A Swiss native educated in American folklore programs, Bendix moves effortlessly between the two traditions, demonstrating how the notion of authenticity was used not only to foster national causes, but also to lay the foundations for categories of documentation and analysis within the nascent field of folklore studies. Bendix shows that, in an increasingly transcultural world, where Zulu singers back up Paul Simon and where indigenous artists seek copyright for their traditional crafts, the politics of authenticity mingles with the forces of the market. Arguing against the dichotomies implied in the very idea of authenticity, she underscores the emptiness of efforts to distinguish between folklore and fakelore, between echt and ersatz.</p><p>Regina Bendix is assistant professor of folklore at the University of Pennsylvania. A native of Switzerland, she is the author of several books and many articles about European and American folklore and folklife, including Backstage Domains: Playing William Tell in Two Communities."Important for scholars in any discipline concerned with cultural analysis. In her focus on folklore and through the tremendous learning and insight she brings to bear on the 'authentic, ' Bendix has provided both a model exploration of one discipline and a broadly consequential analysis of discourses at the heart of many."--Don Brenneis, University of California, Santa Cruz<br><br> Important for scholars in any discipline concerned with cultural analysis.

Robert Lifton constructs these case histories through personal interviews and outlines a thematic pattern of death and rebirth, accompanied by feelings of guilt, that characterizes the process of "thought reform." In a new preface, Lifton addresses the implications of his model for the study of American religious cults.<br><br></p><p>"While exploring the dynamics of Chinese Communist 'thought reform,' Lifton has performed the extraordinary feat of successfully linking . . . distinctly Chinese experiences with universal knowledge about human behavior."-- <i>Journal of Asian Studies</i> <br>Robert Jay Lifton is lecturer on psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and author of <i>Death in Life: Survivors of Hiroshima</i> and <i>The Nazi Doctors</i>.</p><h2>Help Yourself: Finding Hope, Courage, And Happiness</h2><p>As nearly four million readers have learned from his three previous books, Dave Pelzer doesn't believe in feeling sorry for himself. Abused mercilessly by his mother as a child, Dave has taken everything that happened to him and turned it into something positive so that he can help others. Now happily married and with a child of his own, he celebrates the twin pillars of strength that saw him through his darkest hours: resilience and gratitude. And he shows how anyone can tap into these virtues to live a better and more fulfilling life.<br><br>In <b>Help Yourself</b>, Dave Pelzer explains how to move beyond a painful history, harmful negative thoughts, and innumerable setbacks by urging readers to take control and be accountable for their lives. Filled with his own history, as well as the personal struggles of others who have learned how to turn adversity into triumph, <b>Help Yourself</b> is a rousing call to readers who want real answers to real problems. Never before in paperback, it will undoubtedly join Pelzer's previous paperbacks on bestseller lists for years to come.</p><p>Dave Pelzer survived one of the worst child abuse cases ever recorded in the state of California. His mother, a mentally disturbed alcoholic, tortured and abused him throughout his childhood--smashing his face into a mirror, forcing him to swallow ammonia, and making him sit on a burning stove, among other heinous cruelties. In his bestselling memoirs, <i>A Child Called It</i> and <i>The Lost Boy</i>, Pelzer recounts his horrific childhood, demonstrating how inner resilience helped him survive and even become a highly caring and accomplished adult. (He was eventually selected as one of Ten Outstanding Young Americans.)<p> Although Pelzer has a graduate degree in the school of hard knocks, he never got a chip on his shoulder. In this self-help book, Pelzer sticks with his warm and plainspoken narrative style (think <i>Chicken Soup for the Soul</i>) to offer advice on how to help yourself overcome adversity and let go of the past. Wisely, Pelzer often deflects attention away from his overpowering story. Instead, he offers anecdotes that pertain to more common, everyday scenarios: you feel taken advantage of at work but are afraid to quit; you have unresolved issues with your spouse. His guidance is familiar, such as never go to bed upset and tackle problems as they arise--don't let them fester. It may sound simplistic, but sometimes that's just what we need--a trustworthy ally who can dole out "been there" advice in a straightforward style. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><b>Dave Pelzer&nbsp;</b>is the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>A Child Called &#x201c;It"</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Lost Boy,&nbsp;A Man Named Dave,&nbsp;Help Yourself</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Privilege of Youth</i>.&nbsp;He travels more than 250 days a year throughout the nation speaking to large groups of youth and adults on the topics of resilience and overcoming obstacles.

Calling pills "the quintessential icon of Western Civilization," he bemoans the fact that America's attitude toward pills is ambivalent at best, and blames this state of affairs on both an elitist medical profession and public information campaigns that create undue hysteria about the consequences of recreational drug use. Dividing the book into such chapters as "Another Clean-Cut, All-American Speed Freak," "Amphetamines and Football," "I Raided Tom Clancy's Drug Stash" and "Great Pharmacist Authors," he mixes cheerfully blistering rants against doctors, pharmacists and the FDA with overviews of the history, uses and side effects of various widely taken medications. Readers are told what security measures to take when breaking into a pharmacy, what combination of meds is most likely to prevent jet lag and how to forge a prescription. Brash, lively and lavishly illustrated, this is a fun and often informative read, although some of Hogshire's pollyannaish conclusions about the benefits of pills should be taken with a grain of salt, if not a dose of Valium. (Oct.) <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.The drug-appreciative likes of <i>Hashish!</i> (1998) and <i>Opium</i> get lighthearted companionship. Besides "the best tidbits" from the 'zine <i>Pills-A-Go-Go</i>, Hogshire showcases stuff about drug paraphernalia and "inspiring graphics" concerned with "the many taboo, absurd, ignored and forgotten ways pills continue to shape our lives." And then there are the instructional pieces. The kind of instruction offered is practical, especially for home labs, and includes "Making Hard Drugs Out of Mom's Codeine Pills" and "Hacking Valium" (i.e., making diazepam). If offering such information to library patrons seems dicey, think of it as just so many home-schooling science exercises. Mostly, this is a history of popular pills and an exploration of the pill-head lifestyle. The graphics are a treat. Juxtaposing images condemning pill-popping with contemporaneous ones marketing it, they rouse nostalgia for the consumer icons of the past. Later, in an appendix, they amount to a gallery of druggy paperback book cover art. Valuable resource or pop-culture conversation piece. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism (Islam in the Twenty-First Century)</h2><p>Confronting such key contemporary issues as racism, justice, sexuality, and gender, this book offers a revealing insight into the real challenges faced by Muslims of both sexes in Western society.</p><p>Omid Safi is Associate Professor of Religious Studies at University of North Carolina. He specialises in the study of the Islamic mystical tradition, the pre-modern history of the Islamic world, and contemporary Muslim thought, and has written books and articles on these subjects.Safi, a Colgate University professor, assembles a diverse set of essays by and about "progressive" Muslims. The essays vary in topic and in effectiveness, but generally seek to challenge the images of Islam held by both xenophobic Westerners and extremist Muslims. Safi's introduction, though showing insight into many problems today's Muslims face but rarely discuss publicly, is clunky, citing sources from Gandhi to Bob Dylan. Part I offers hard-hitting essays that are sure to be controversial in their discussion of what scholar Tazim Kassam claims is a "curtailment... of civil liberties such as freedom of inquiry and the expression of dissenting opinions" in the U.S. after September 11. There are also some triumphant essays. Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle superbly analyzes Islam's categorization of homosexuality as a sin in an essay that is long overdue and probably the only scholarly work of its kind. Gwendolyn Simmons's piece demands the establishment of feminism as Islamic in a touching essay-cum-memoir that connects her growth as a Muslim female to her experience as a young African-American during the Civil Rights era. The incomparable Amina Wadud offers an excellent article on racial tensions between immigrant and indigenous Muslims, while Marcia Hermansen pens the volume's bravest and most honest contribution, addressing the increasing conservatism of her American Muslim students-a topic previously not discussed outside the Muslim community. This collection is recommended for those who yearn for realistic information about Muslims, and for Muslims who are disgruntled with current Islamic leadership. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mexican Family Favorites Cook Book by Maria Teresa Bermudez</h2><p>More than 275,000 sold!

I was tempted to take a picture, just to remind myself of the moment when darker days returned, as no doubt they would.</p><p>The group had good reason to look happy. We were fully staffed, with the recent addition of a new registrar to complete the roster of management positions; we had a wealth of material to keep our staff busy cataloging for years; and we had earned the gratitude of the FBI for agreeing to sort through the bits and bobs of art and artifacts that their Philadelphia office had confiscated over the past several years. And we had just received a nice&#x2014;make that a <i>really</i> nice&#x2014;financial contribution from big-name local developer Mitchell Wakeman, who had asked me to help him smooth the path for his planned development project in the suburbs. Luckily he hadn&#x2019;t blamed me when we had stumbled over a body along the way, but I&#x2019;d shown him how to use the information we&#x2019;d uncovered in solving the murder to strengthen the project, unlikely though it seemed. He had been appropriately grateful and had presented the Society (of which I, Nell Pratt, was president) with a pot of money, with the restriction that it must be used for physical improvements to our century-plus-old building, rather than collections or staff salaries. It was a reasonable request; he was, after all, a mogul of the construction industry, and we really did need those physical improvements. We had already moved from the planning stages to the physical preparations, and we were ready to start the construction phase.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been pleased that I could introduce both the project designer&#x2014;Kemble and Warren, a long-established firm with an excellent track record&#x2014;and the contractor for our renovations, Schuylkill Construction, which had come highly recommended by Mitchell Wakeman at the fall board meeting. I hadn&#x2019;t expected any problems, and there weren&#x2019;t any. The companies involved in the project had taken part in a number of similar projects for local art or collecting institutions, so the staffs there understood the challenges of working around delicate collections and finicky researchers. We wanted to accomplish the overhaul with a minimum of disruption to patrons, and without closing the doors. There were sections we were going to have to restrict access to for a time, but all things considered, the plan was the best we could hope for. We&#x2019;d make the best of the inevitable disarray by giving our annual holiday-season party a construction-related theme&#x2014;paint-spattered tablecloths and mock hard hats for all. By spring we&#x2019;d be all prettied up, structurally and environmentally sound, and ready to throw a big unveiling party.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve already given approval of the design aspects by Kemble and Warren. Now we are voting to approve the final work plan as presented by Schuylkill Construction. All in favor?&#x201d; I asked, standing tall at the head of the table. <i>Aye</i>s all around. &#x201c;Then the project is approved, and work will begin immediately,&#x201d; I announced triumphantly. Actually, work had already begun. As a collections-based organization, for more than a century we had accumulated a lot of stuff, not all of it with historic importance. For example, the basement was loaded with wooden filing cabinets and computer terminals so old that the companies who made them had long since gone out of business. A Dumpster now occupied a permanent place next to the loading dock in the alley behind the building, and we filled it regularly these days.</p><p>I turned to Joseph Logan, head of Schuylkill Construction, who&#x2019;d been invited to witness the final board vote. &#x201c;Thank you, Mr. Logan, for all the work that you&#x2019;ve put into this so far. We look forward to working with you&#x2014;as long as you stick to the schedule.&#x201d;</p><p>Logan smiled. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all under control. And you&#x2019;ve got a great building here, so I don&#x2019;t expect to find many problems.&#x201d;</p><p>I knew full well that digging into any old building usually resulted in at least a few unexpected problems, but I had faith that they would be minor ones. At least, I hoped so. Hadn&#x2019;t we had enough problems in the past year? We should have earned some good karma by now.</p><p>&#x201c;Any new business?&#x201d; I asked the group.</p><p>One of our older, more scholarly board members raised his hand. &#x201c;How do you intend to prioritize projects going forward, when we have our own cataloging to do, plus the FBI materials, and now our space will be reduced?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Our vice president of collections, Latoya Anderson, has worked out a schedule to deal with that, and I have every expectation that she will run a tight ship,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;Of course, our own collections come first&#x2014;there&#x2019;s no particular timeline for the FBI materials. I didn&#x2019;t ask her to attend this meeting because I wanted to focus on the construction aspects, but I can have her forward you a copy of her plans. Anything else?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How do you plan to handle dust spreading through the building?&#x201d; someone else asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Fair question. When we reach the stage of adding modern ventilation, we will address protecting the collections then. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;ve hired people who have worked under these conditions before, and they all have excellent reputations.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t it have been better to remove the collections to an off-site location?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>I swallowed a sigh; we&#x2019;d been over all this before. &#x201c;We did consider that, but off-site storage presents its own problems&#x2014;we&#x2019;d have little control over the physical conditions, and security is not always what it should be, no matter what promises the storage companies make. We&#x2019;re talking about some priceless documents, among other things, and we&#x2019;d rather keep them here, even if it means shuttling them from one location to another within the building.&#x201d;</p><p>I scanned the group, and saw most of them making twitchy ready-to-leave motions. &#x201c;And remember, when we&#x2019;re done, we will actually have increased our storage space without expanding the building&#x2019;s footprint, thanks to installing compact shelving wherever possible. I can&#x2019;t tell you exactly by how much, because the contractor is still assessing the load-bearing capacity of some of the areas, but I have been assured that it will be substantial.&#x201d;</p><p>Lewis Howard, the venerable board chair, stood up. &#x201c;Thank you, Nell, for all the good work you have put into making this happen. If there are no other issues&#x201d;&#x2014;he looked sternly at the other people around the table, and nobody opened their mouth&#x2014;&#x201c;then I declare this meeting adjourned. Good night, all.&#x201d;</p><p>The board members gathered up their folders and coats and hurried to the elevator. I thanked the architect and the contractor, who told me they&#x2019;d be back early the next morning for a final walk-through before the physical work began. Finally I was left alone with Marty Terwilliger, a longtime board member (practically hereditary, since both her father and her grandfather had been very actively involved at the Society) and good friend, both professionally and personally.</p><p>&#x201c;Good job wrangling the board, Nell,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks. It did go well, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do. Of course, they had nothing to complain about, since you brought in Wakeman&#x2019;s pile of money. Which you earned, since you helped save his butt on his pet project.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In a way, I&#x2019;m glad he restricted how it should be used. He had a pretty clear idea what we needed to do here, and it saved a lot of squabbling among the board members.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a smart man, and an honest one. If you throw a big bash, make sure you invite him&#x2014;and that he comes.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d certainly ask, although I knew that Mitchell Wakeman didn&#x2019;t like socializing much. &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>Marty glanced at the clock on the wall and stood up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m heading out. You ready? We can walk out together.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;Let me grab my stuff.&#x201d; I went back to my office down the hall, picked up my bag, put on my coat, and rejoined her in the hall after turning out the last few lights.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;re you and Jimmy liking the new place?&#x201d; Marty asked as we headed out. &#x201c;Jimmy&#x201d; was FBI Special Agent James Morrison, who had somehow gotten sucked into several crimes that I was also involved in, and since we were both single and intelligent and reasonable human beings, the inevitable had happened and a couple of months earlier we had bought a house together. Marty had a proprietary interest in our relationship because James was some kind of cousin of hers (one of many in the greater Philadelphia area) and because she&#x2019;d introduced us and seen us both through some traumatic events. She was a snoop, but a polite and well-meaning one, and she was willing to back off if asked.</p><p>For the past decade, I&#x2019;d been living in Bryn Mawr, in what had once been a carriage house behind one of the big Main Line houses. It had been cheaply converted before I bought it, and I&#x2019;d spent a couple of years improving it. It was small, but it had worked for me.</p><p>And then James had happened, and the carriage house simply wasn&#x2019;t big enough for two. And he didn&#x2019;t want to live way out in the suburbs. When we first met, his own place was a Spartan apartment near the University of Pennsylvania, in a converted triple-decker. As in my case, it suited him but it wasn&#x2019;t intended for two adults with decades&#x2019; worth of stuff. So we&#x2019;d taken the plunge and bought a Victorian in an area that wasn&#x2019;t quite city or suburb but the best of both.</p><p>&#x201c;You know, I&#x2019;m really not settled into this commute to Chestnut Hill yet. I don&#x2019;t want to drive every day. I&#x2019;m still trying to figure out the daily train schedule&#x2014;I had the one to Bryn Mawr memorized, but this one is new to me. I catch a ride with James when I can, but his schedule is kind of unpredictable.&#x201d; We&#x2019;d been living in the house only a month, once all the closing formalities had been completed and we&#x2019;d written checks with a horrifying number of digits on them, and we still hadn&#x2019;t established any kind of routine. But if that was the worst of my problems, I wasn&#x2019;t going to gripe. &#x201c;Eliot waiting for you tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>Marty and Eliot Miller, the Penn professor she&#x2019;d been seeing, were moving more slowly than James and I were, and still maintained their own domiciles. Marty lived in a lovely nineteenth-century row house in a convenient Center City location&#x2014;the better to walk over to the Society when the spirit moved her, which was often&#x2014;and I had no idea where Eliot lived. He taught urban planning at the University of Pennsylvania, though, so I figured he probably lived not far from campus. Marty and I hadn&#x2019;t discussed their long-term plans, and she was volunteering little information, maybe afraid she would jinx the fledgling relationship. She had a couple of failed marriages on her r�sum�.</p><p>&#x201c;Not tonight&#x2014;he had an all-hands faculty meeting, and I had this, so we decided we&#x2019;d see each other tomorrow. How&#x2019;s Lissa working out?&#x201d;</p><p>Lissa Penrose was one of Eliot&#x2019;s advisees as she worked on a graduate degree. &#x201c;Great. I&#x2019;ve asked her to review the history of this building. She&#x2019;ll be working with Shelby, too.&#x201d;</p><p>Shelby had taken over my previous position as director of development at the Society when I&#x2019;d been abruptly elevated to the position of president, and we worked well together. Her dash of Southern charm had proved to be an asset when wangling contributions from our members. She had submitted a brief report on contributions and attended this meeting for purely ceremonial purposes, as a senior staff member, but had disappeared quickly while I was still saying my farewells to the board members. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hoping we can put together some material on interesting building details, to use for fundraising.&#x201d;</p><p>We closed up the building behind us, making sure the security system was armed, and said good-bye at the foot of the stairs outside. Marty headed home, and I crossed the street and retrieved my car from the lot. At least this parking fee I could charge to the Society. At this time of night there was little traffic, and it didn&#x2019;t take long to reach home.</p><p>Home. I had trouble wrapping my head around that. The house was gorgeous, and I still tiptoed around it waiting for someone to tell me I wasn&#x2019;t worthy of it and throw me out. It had a parlor. It had five bedrooms. It was ridiculous for two people, but James had fallen for it on sight, and I had, too, when he showed it to me. And we could afford it, mostly. Neither the government nor mid-sized nonprofit organizations pay very well, but we were managing, albeit with not much with the way of furniture. But now it was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. home.</p><p>I parked in the spacious three-car garage, then made my way to the back door, which led into the kitchen. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; I called out. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m home.&#x201d;</p><p>I could hear James galumphing down the stairs (original woodwork! Never painted!), and then he joined me in the kitchen (which had a modern stove that terrified me with its array of knobs and digital indicators). As he approached I marveled once again that this tall, dark (well, greying a bit), and handsome&#x2014;and smart and successful&#x2014;FBI agent had fallen for me. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d it go? Have you eaten?&#x201d; Rather than waiting for an answer, he gave me a very satisfying kiss. I was definitely enjoying coming home these days.</p><p>When he finally let me go, I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll answer question number two first: no. What is there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Check the fridge. I think there are still leftovers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid of the fridge. I keep thinking I&#x2019;ll start looking in there and I&#x2019;ll never find my way out again.&#x201d; I walked over to the gleaming expanse of stainless steel, opened the door, and peered in. &#x201c;I see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ooh, Chinese. How old is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Three days, maybe?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good enough.&#x201d; I dumped a half-full carton of lo mein into a bowl and stuck it in the microwave. &#x201c;As for the first question, fine. No surprises. The next couple of months will be chaotic, but we&#x2019;ll survive. Wine?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Way ahead of you.&#x201d; James handed me a glass of white wine, and we clinked glasses.</p><p>&#x201c;Ahh, that&#x2019;s good.&#x201d; I sighed after downing a healthy sip and kicking off my shoes.</p><p>He carefully took my glass and set it on the shiny granite-topped island&#x2014;and repeated his earlier greeting. It took a couple of minutes before we peeled ourselves apart. &#x201c;Welcome home, Nell,&#x201d; he said softly.</p><p>&#x201c;You must have missed me. How was your day?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very ordinary, thank you. That&#x2019;s a good thing. No crises, no disasters. I filed a lot of reports.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And here I thought that working for the FBI was exciting,&#x201d; I said, pulling the hot food out of the microwave. &#x201c;Where did we hide the chopsticks?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That drawer? Or maybe the one over there. I haven&#x2019;t seen them lately.&#x201d;</p><p>Our few pitiful utensils looked like orphans cringing in the vast spaces of drawers and cupboards. It didn&#x2019;t take long to look. &#x201c;Got &#x2019;em. I assume you ate? Because this is all mine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I did, and it is. Enjoy.&#x201d;</p><p>When I&#x2019;d all but licked the bowl, I drained the last of my wine. &#x201c;Much better.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By the way, the faucet is still dripping in the bathtub.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, you&#x2019;re the big, strong man&#x2014;you&#x2019;re supposed to know how to fix it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the historian,&#x201d; he countered. &#x201c;This is definitely Victorian plumbing, therefore old, therefore your territory.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;...</p></p><h2>The Good Girl (English Edition)</h2><p><b><i>Read the bestseller everyone is talking about!</i><br>"A cleverly constructed suspense thriller." &#x2014;Chicago Tribune, Printer's Row<br>"A twisty, roller coaster ride of a debut.

I'm lost in thought, staring out the back window at the lawn that now, in the throes of an early fall, abounds with leaves. They're dead mostly, some still clinging lifelessly to the trees. It's late afternoon. The sky is overcast, the temperatures doing a nosedive into the forties and fifties. I'm not ready for this, I think, wondering where in the world the time has gone. Seems like just yesterday we were welcoming spring and then, moments later, summer.<br><br>The phone startles me and I'm certain it's a telemarketer, so I don't initially bother to rise from my perch. I relish the last few hours of silence I have before James comes thundering through the front doors and intrudes upon my world, and the last thing I want to do is waste precious minutes on some telemarketer's sales pitch that I'm certain to refuse.<br><br>The irritating noise of the phone stops and then starts again. I answer it for no other reason than to make it stop.<br><br>"Hello?" I ask in a vexed tone, standing now in the center of the kitchen, one hip pressed against the island.<br><br>"Mrs. Dennett?" the woman asks. I consider for a moment telling her that she's got the wrong number, or ending her pitch right there with a simple <em>not interested.</em> "This is she."<br><br>"Mrs. Dennett, this is Ayanna Jackson." I've heard the name before. I've never met her, but she's been a constant in Mia's life for over a year now. How many times have I heard Mia say her name: <em>Ayanna and I did this...Ayanna and I did that....</em> She is explaining how she knows Mia, how the two of them teach together at the alternative high school in the city. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything," she says.<br><br>I catch my breath. "Oh, no, Ayanna, I just walked in the door," I lie.<br><br>Mia will be twenty-five in just a month: October 31st. She was born on Halloween and so I assume Ayanna has called about this. She wants to plan a party&#x2014;a surprise party?&#x2014;for my daughter.<br><br>"Mrs. Dennett, Mia didn't show up for work today," she says.<br><br>This isn't what I expect to hear. It takes a moment to regroup. "Well, she must be sick," I respond. My first thought is to cover for my daughter; she must have a viable explanation why she didn't go to work or call in her absence. My daughter is a free spirit, yes, but also reliable.<br><br>"You haven't heard from her?"<br><br>"No," I say, but this isn't unusual. We go days, sometimes weeks, without speaking. Since the invention of email, our best form of communication has become passing along trivial forwards.<br><br>"I tried calling her at home but there's no answer."<br><br>"Did you leave a message?"<br><br>"Several."<br><br>"And she hasn't called back?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>I'm listening only halfheartedly to the woman on the other end of the line. I stare out the window, watching the neighbors' children shake a flimsy tree so that the remaining leaves fall down upon them. The children are my clock; when they appear in the backyard I know that it's late afternoon, school is through. When they disappear inside again it's time to start dinner.<br><br>"Her cell phone?"<br><br>"It goes straight to voice mail."<br><br>"Did you&#x2014;"<br><br>"I left a message."<br><br>"You're certain she didn't call in today?"<br><br>"Administration never heard from her."<br><br>I'm worried that Mia will get in trouble. I'm worried that she will be fired. The fact that she might already be in trouble has yet to cross my mind.<br><br>"I hope this hasn't caused too much of a problem."<br><br>Ayanna explains that Mia's first-period students didn't inform anyone of the teacher's absence and it wasn't until second period that word finally leaked out: Ms. Dennett wasn't here today and there wasn't a sub. The principal went down to keep order until a substitute could be called in; he found gang graffiti scribbled across the walls with Mia's overpriced art supplies, the ones she bought herself when the administration said no.<br><br>"Mrs. Dennett, don't you think it's odd?" she asks. "This isn't like Mia."<br><br>"Oh, Ayanna, I'm certain she has a good excuse."<br><br>"Such as?" she asks.<br><br>"I'll call the hospitals. There's a number in her area&#x2014;"<br><br>"I've done that."<br><br>"Then her friends," I say, but I don't know any of Mia's friends. I've heard names in passing, such as Ayanna and Lauren and I know there's a Zimbabwean on a student visa who's about to be sent back and Mia thinks it's completely unfair. But I don't <em>know</em> them, and last names or contact information are hard to find.<br><br>"I've done that."<br><br>"She'll show up, Ayanna. This is all just a misunderstanding. There could be a million reasons for this."<br><br>"Mrs. Dennett," Ayanna says and it's then that it hits me: something is wrong. It hits me in the stomach and the first thought I have is myself seven or eight months pregnant with Mia and her stalwart limbs kicking and punching so hard that tiny feet and hands emerge in shapes through my skin. I pull out a barstool and sit at the kitchen island and think to myself that before I know it, Mia will be twenty-five and I haven't so much as thought of a gift. I haven't proposed a party or suggested that all of us, James and Grace and Mia and me, make reservations for an elegant dinner in the city.<br><br>"What do you suggest we do, then?" I ask.<br><br>There's a sigh on the other end of the line. "I was hoping you'd tell me Mia was with you," she says.<br><br><strong>GABE</strong><br><br><strong>BEFORE</strong><br><br>It's dark by the time I pull up to the house. Light pours from the windows of the English Tudor home and onto the tree-lined street. I can see a collection of people hovering inside, waiting for me. There's the judge, pacing, and Mrs. Dennett perched on the edge of an upholstered seat, sipping from a glass of something that appears to be alcoholic. There are uniformed officers and another woman, a brunette, who peers out the front window as I come to a sluggish halt in the street, delaying my grand entrance.<br><br>The Dennetts are like any other family along Chicago's North Shore, a string of suburbs that lines Lake Michigan to the north of the city. They're filthy rich. It's no wonder that I'm procrastinating in the front seat of my car when I should be making my way up to the massive home with the clout I've been led to believe I carry.<br><br>I think of the sergeant's words before assigning the case to me: <em>Don't fuck this one up.</em><br><br>I eye the stately home from the safety and warmth of my dilapidated car. From the outside it's not as colossal as I envision the interior to be. It has all the old-world charm an English Tudor has to offer: half-timbering and narrow windows and a steep sloping roof. It reminds me of a medieval castle.<br><br>Though I've been strictly warned to keep it under wraps, I'm supposed to feel privileged that the sergeant assigned this highprofile case to me. And yet, for some reason, I don't.<br><br>I make my way up to the front door, cutting across the lawn to the sidewalk that leads me up two steps, and knock. It's cold. I thrust my hands into my pockets to keep them warm while I wait. I feel ridiculously underdressed in my street clothes&#x2014;khaki pants and a polo shirt that I've hidden beneath a leather jacket&#x2014;when I'm greeted by one of the most influential justices of the peace in the county.<br><br>"Judge Dennett," I say, allowing myself inside. I conduct myself with more authority than I feel I have, displaying traces of self-confidence that I must keep stored somewhere safe for moments like this. Judge Dennett is a considerable man in size and power. Screw this one up and I'll be out of a job, best-case scenario. Mrs. Dennett rises from the chair. I tell her in my most refined voice, "Please, sit," and the other woman, Grace Dennett, I assume, from my preliminary research&#x2014;a younger woman, likely in her twenties or early thirties&#x2014;meets Judge Dennett and me in the place where the foyer ends and the living room begins.<br><br>"Detective Gabe Hoffman," I say, without the pleasantries an introduction might expect. I don't smile; I don't offer to shake hands. The girl says that she is in fact Grace, whom I know from my earlier legwork to be a senior associate at the law firm of Dalton &amp; Meyers. But it takes nothing more than intuition to know from the get-go that I don't like her; there's an air of superiority that surrounds her, a looking down on my blue-collar clothing and a cynicism in her voice that gives me the willies.<br><br>Mrs. Dennett speaks, her voice still carrying a strong British accent, though I know, from my previous fact-finding expedition, that she's been in the United States since she was eighteen. She seems panicked. That's my first inclination. Her voice is high-pitched, her fingers fidgeting with anything that comes within reach. "My daughter is missing, Detective," she sputters. "Her friends haven't seen her. Haven't spoken to her. I've been calling her cell phone, leaving messages." She chokes on her words, trying desperately not to cry. "I went to her apartment to see if she was there," she says, then admits, "I drove all the way there and the landlord wouldn't let me in."<br><br>Mrs. Dennett is a breathtaking woman. I can't help but stare at the way her long blond hair falls clumsily over the conspicuous hint of cleavage that pokes through her blouse, where she's left the top button undone. I've seen pictures before of Mrs. Dennett, standing beside her husband on the courthouse steps. But the photos do nothing compared to seeing Eve Dennett in the flesh.<br><br>"When is the last time you spoke to her?" I ask. "Last week," the judge says.<br><br>"Not last week, James," Eve says. She pauses, aware of the annoyed look on her husband's face because of the interruption, before continuing. "The week before. Maybe even the one before that. That's the way our relationship is with Mia&#x2014;we go for weeks sometimes without speaking."<br><br>"So this isn't unusual then?" I ask. "To not hear from her for a while?"<br><br>"No," Mrs. Dennett concedes.<br><br>"And what about you, Grace?"<br><br>"We spoke last week. Just a quick call. Wednesday, I believe. Maybe Thursday. Yes, it was Thursday because she called as I was walking into the courthouse for a hearing on a motion to suppress." She throws that in, just so I know she's an attorney, as if the pin-striped blazer and leather briefcase beside her feet didn't already give that away.<br><br>"Anything out of the ordinary?"<br><br>"Just Mia being Mia."<br><br>"And that means?"<br><br>"Gabe," the judge interrupts.<br><br>"Detective Hoffman," I assert authoritatively. If I have to call him <em>Judge</em> he can certainly call me <em>Detective.</em><br><br>"Mia is very independent. She moves to the beat of her own drum, so to speak."<br><br>"So hypothetically your daughter has been gone since Thursday?"<br><br>"A friend spoke to her yesterday, saw her at work."<br><br>"What time?"<br><br>"I don't know... 3:00 p.m."<br><br>I glance at my watch. "So, she's been missing for twenty-seven hours?"<br><br>"Is it true that she's not considered missing until she's been gone for forty-eight hours?" Mrs. Dennett asks.<br><br>"Of course not, Eve," her husband replies in a degrading tone.<br><br>"No, ma'am," I say. I try to be extracordial. I don't like the way her husband demeans her. "In fact, the first forty-eight hours are often the most critical in missing-persons cases."<br><br>The judge jumps in. "My daughter is not a missing person. She's <em>misplaced.</em> She's doing something rash and negligent, something irresponsible. But she's not <em>missing."</em><br><br>"Your Honor, who was the last one to see your daughter then, before she was&#x2014;" I'm a smart-ass and so I have to say it <em>"&#x2014;misplaced?"</em><br><br>It's Mrs. Dennett who responds. "A woman named Ayanna Jackson. She and Mia are co-workers."<br><br>"Do you have a contact number?"<br><br>"On a sheet of paper. In the kitchen." I nod toward one of the officers, who heads into the kitchen to get it. "Is this something Mia has done before?"<br><br>"No, absolutely not."<br><br>But the body language ofJudge and Grace Dennett says otherwise.<br><br>"That's not true, Mom," Grace chides. I watch her expectantly. Lawyers just love to hear themselves speak. "On five or six different occasions Mia disappeared from the house. Spent the night doing God knows what with God knows whom."<br><br>Yes, I think to myself, Grace Dennett is a bitch. Grace has dark hair like her dad's. She's got her mother's height and her father's shape. Not a good mix. Some people might call it an hourglass figure; I probably would, too, if I liked her. But instead, I call it plump.<br><br>"That's completely different. She was in high school. She was a little naive and mischievous, but."<br><br>"Eve, don't read more into this than there is," Judge Dennett says.<br><br>"Does Mia drink?" I ask.<br><br>"Not much," Mrs. Dennett says.<br><br>"How do you know what Mia does, Eve? You two rarely speak."<br><br>She puts her hand to her face to blot a runny nose and for a moment I am so taken aback by the size of the rock on her finger that I don't hear James Dennett rambling on about how his wife had put in the call to Eddie&#x2014;mind you, I'm struck here by the fact that not only is the judge on a first-name basis with my boss, but he's also on a <em>nickname</em> basis&#x2014;before he got home. Judge Dennett seems convinced that his daughter is out for a good time, and that there's no need for any official involvement.<br><br>"You don't think this is a case for the police?" I ask.<br><br>"Absolutely not. This is an issue for the family to handle."<br><br>"How is Mia's work ethic?"<br><br>"Excuse me?" the judge retorts as wrinkles form across his forehead and he rubs them away with an aggravated hand.<br><br>"Her work ethic. Does she have a good employment history? Has she ever skipped work before? Does she call in often, claim she's sick when she's not?"<br><br>"I don't know. She has a job. She gets paid. She supports herself. I don't ask questions."<br><br>"Mrs. Dennett?"<br><br>"She loves her job. She just loves it. Teaching is what she always wanted to do."<br><br>Mia is an art teacher. High school. I jot this down in my notes as a reminder.<br><br>The judge wants to know if I think that's important. "Might be," I respond.<br><br>"And why's that?"<br><br>"Your Honor, I'm just trying to understand your daughter. Understand who she is. That's all."<br><br>Mrs. Dennett is now on the verge of tears. Her blue eyes begin to swell and redden as she pathetically attempts to suppress the tiny drips. "You think something has happened to Mia?"<br><br>I'm thinking to myself: isn't that why you called me here? <em>You</em> think something has happened to Mia, but instead I say, "I think we act now and thank God later when this all turns out to be a big misunderstanding. I'm certain she's fine, I am, but I'd hate to overlook this whole thing without at least looking into it." I'd kick myself if&#x2014;<em>if-</em>&#x2014;it turned out everything wasn't fine.<br><br>"How long has Mia been living on her own?" I ask.<br><br>"It'll be seven years in thirty days," Mrs. Dennett states pointblank.<br><br>I'm taken aback. "You keep count? Down to the day?"<br><br>"It was her eighteenth birthday. She couldn't...</p><h2>Old Trading Posts of the Four Corners</h2><p>This book is about trading posts. Old trading posts. Trading posts that are still operating and ones that are long gone without a trace, except for a crumbling wall or foundation. The book describes the present condition of each post, examines its history, and provides directions to even the hard-to-find posts. Indian trading posts are rapidly becoming a thing of the past, and, although many still occupy the original buildings, few of today&#39;s so-called trading posts bear any similarity to the working posts of the past. This book is a guide to early-day trading posts established on or around the Navajo, Hopi, and Ute Mountain Ute Reservations.</p><p>Richard C. Berkholz, a native of Missouri, is retired after 34 years in the forestry profession. He currently lives in Durango, Colorado, with his wife Judy. His interest in western history and appreciation of the high desert southwest, combined with his realization that many of the old trading posts of the Four Corners are rapidly disappearing, led him to write this book. He has traveled extensively throughout the Four Corners region, visiting and researching the numerous sites.&#34;One of the most intriguing stories, yet sadly undocumented until now, is that of the trading posts that dotted the four corners region. That long-time failure has been corrected in Old Trading Posts of the Four Corners.&#34; --Duane Smith, Professor of History, Fort Lewis College, Durango, Colorado</p><h2>The Wolves of Mount McKinley</h2><p>In the time of Lewis and Clark, wolves were abundant throughout North America from the Arctic regions to Mexico. But man declared war on this cunning and powerful animal when cattle replaced the buffalo on the western plains, reducing the wolf&#x2019;s range to those few areas in the Far North where economic necessity did not call for its extinction.<br><br>Between 1939 and 1941, Adolph Murie, one of North America&#x2019;s greatest naturalists, made a field study of the relationship between wolves and Dall sheep in Mount McKinley National Park (since renamed Denali National Park) which has come to be respected as a classic work of natural history. In this study Murie not only described the life cycle of Alaskan wolves in greater detail than has ever been done, but he discovered a great deal about the entire ecological network of predator and prey.<br><br>The issues surrounding the survival of the wolf and its prey are more important today than ever, and Murie helps us understand the careful balance that must be maintained to ensure that these magnificent animals prosper. Originally available only in government publications which are long out-of-print, this account of a much maligned animal is now available in its first popular edition.</p><p>"Murie&#x2019;s work is still one of the most frequently cited references on wolf biology today."&#x2015;<i>Choice</i></p><h2>The Life of Yogananda: The Story of the Yogi Who Became the First Modern Guru</h2><p>He was called "the 20th century&#x2019;s first superstar guru" (Los Angeles Times), and today, nearly a century after he arrived in the United States, he&#x2019;s still the best known and most beloved of all the Indian spiritual teachers who have come to the West. Now, finally, Paramahansa Yogananda has the authoritative biography he deserves.Yogananda, considered by many to be the father of modern yoga, has had an unsurpassed global impact thanks to the durability of his teachings, the institutions he created or inspired, and especially his iconic memoir, Autobiography of a Yogi.Since its publication in 1946, that book has sold millions of copies and changed millions of lives. But it doesn&#x2019;t tell the whole story.Much of Yogananda&#x2019;s seminal text is devoted to tales about other people, and it largely overlooks the three vital decades he spent living, working, and teaching in America. Huge chunks of his life&#x2014;challenges, controversies, and crises; triumphs, relationships, and formative experiences&#x2014;remain unknown to even his most ardent devotees. In this captivating biography, scholar and teacher Philip Goldberg fills the gaps, charting a journey that spanned six decades, two hemispheres, two world wars, and unprecedented social changes. The result is an objective, thoroughly researched account of Yogananda&#x2019;s remarkable life in all its detail, nuance, and complex humanity.But this is more than a compelling life story. "Yogananda would, I believe, want any book about him to not only inform but transform," Goldberg writes. "It is my hope that readers will be enriched, expanded, and deepened by this humble offering." That is sure to be the case for both Yogananda enthusiasts and those who discover him for the first time in these illuminating pages.</p><p>Philip Goldberg grew up in Brooklyn and now lives in Los Angeles. A professional writer for more than 40 years, he is author or co-author of some 25 books published in more than a dozen languages. He is also a skilled public speaker, a workshop leader, a spiritual counselor, and the co-host of the popular podcast Spirit Matters. He blogs at Huffington Post and Spirituality &amp; Health, and contributes to other publications. His most recent book prior to this one&#x2014;American Veda&#x2014;chronicles the impact of India's spiritual teachings on the West; it was named by Huffington Post and Library Journal as one of the top 10 Religion books of 2010. Website: philipgoldberg.com"Philip Goldberg sheds new light on the incredible story and illuminates the forces that made Yogananda a spiritual teacher and role model for the ages."<br>&#x2014; Deepak Chopra, M.D., author of The Healing Self<br><br>"The Life of Yogananda is a profound and exquisitely written account of the life of one of the most renowned spiritual masters of our time, and is essential reading for anyone on a spiritual path. My experience is that, in a mysterious but unmistakable way, this book pulsates with the very presence, blessing, and transmission of Yogananda&#x2019;s limitless wisdom and grace. With insight, clarity, and his own depth of consciousness, Philip Goldberg takes you on a virtual pilgrimage that will uplift you, inspire you, and illuminate your own journey of awakening."<br>&#x2014; Dr. Barbara De Angelis, #1 New York Times best-selling author of Soul Shifts and The Choice for Love<br><br>"The long sought and much anticipated synthesis of East and West has yet to fully materialize, although there have been some very profound moves in that direction. It is therefore entirely appropriate that Philip Goldberg delivers a thoroughly readable biography of perhaps the first, and to date the most influential, integrator of Eastern and Western philosophical traditions, the remarkable Yogananda, in The Life of Yogananda: The Story of the Yogi Who Became the First Modern Guru. With any attempt at summarizing the life of a stunningly great person, the endeavor itself is fraught with difficulties, but Goldberg takes a very common-sense approach, including aspects of Yogananda&#x2019;s life that seemed truly divine and deeply inspired, as well as those that were all too human. The result is a brilliant account of what history will recognize as one of the most significant lives of the 20th century. The question is, when Yogananda himself had already written the wildly popular and very widely read Autobiography of a Yogi, do we really need this new book? Does it justify itself? I believe that it does, very much so. Sympathetic yet critical, the book brings to light an enormous number of facets of Yogananda&#x2019;s life, times, spiritual realization, culture clashes, and personal dimensions, all of which shed a huge amount of information not only about Yogananda and his own spiritual search, but also about the deeper synthesis of East and West that is still lying in humanity&#x2019;s future. I highly recommend you read this book, and get a profound reminder of what the spiritual search is all about."<br>&#x2014; Ken Wilber, author of The Religion of Tomorrow<br><br>"In this intensely researched book, Phil Goldberg describes the deep commitment and tireless effort of Paramahansa Yogananda to bring the spiritual teachings of India to the West.

In this new biography, Phil offers us a full portrait of an extraordinary man.

As with all great spiritual masters, understanding who Yogananda is spiritually helps us to understand who we deep down really are and are called to be&#x2014;namaste! For me personally, the significance of this book&#x2019;s account of Yogananda seeding the ancient wisdom of yoga into our Western culture and religious traditions reminds me of my experience of being with Thomas Merton at Gethsemani in the 1960s. Merton told me he practiced yoga. He showed me some yoga postures and gave me a copy of Dechanet&#x2019;s Christian yoga, which helped me to integrate yoga into my own spiritual practices. When I was in the monastery with Merton, the Benedictine monk Bede Griffith was living as a sanyasi in his ashram in India, as was his teacher, the Benedictine monk Abashiktananda, whose book The Hidden Christ of Hinduism deepened my own understanding of the underlying unity that permeates all the world&#x2019;s great religions."<br>&#x2014; James Finley, Ph.D., core teacher at the Center for Action and Contemplation, author of Merton&#x2019;s Palace of Nowhere and Christian Meditation<br><br>"With The Life of Yogananda, Philip Goldberg has placed himself as a premier historian of American yoga.

British men and women left their homes and traveled to this mysterious, beautiful country&#x2013;where they attempted to replicate their own society. In this fascinating portrait, Margaret MacMillan examines the hidden lives of the women who supported their husbands&#x2019; conquests&#x2013;and in turn supported the Raj, often behind the scenes and out of the history books. Enduring heartbreaking separations from their families, these women had no choice but to adapt to their strange new home, where they were treated with incredible deference by the natives but found little that was familiar. The women of the Raj learned to cope with the harsh Indian climate and ward off endemic diseases; they were forced to make their own entertainment&#x2013;through games, balls, and theatrics&#x2013;and quickly learned to abide by the deeply ingrained Anglo-Indian love of hierarchy.<br><br>Weaving interviews, letters, and memoirs with a stunning selection of illustrations, MacMillan presents a vivid cultural and social history of the daughters, sisters, mothers, and wives of the men at the center of a daring imperialist experiment&#x2013;and reveals India in all its richness and vitality.<br><br>&#x201c;A marvellous book . . .

She is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature; a senior fellow of Massey College, University of Toronto; and an honorary fellow of Trinity College, University of Toronto, and of St. Hilda&#x2019;s College, Oxford University. Her previous books include <i>Dangerous Games: The Uses and Abuses of History; Nixon and Mao: The Week That Changed the World; Women of the Raj: The Mothers, Wives, and Daughters of the British Empire in India</i>; and <i>Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World,</i> which won the Samuel Johnson Prize, the PEN Hessell-Tiltman Prize, and the Duff Cooper Prize and was a <i>New York Times</i> Editors&#x2019; Choice.<b>Chapter 1<br></b><br><b>The Voyage Out</b><br><br>Englishwomen&#x2014;and Welsh and Scots and Irish women&#x2014;had been going to India for generations by the time the Raj reached its peak in the late nineteenth century. The first to make the voyage may have been a Mrs. Hudson and her maid, Frances Webb, who went in 1617 as companions to an Armenian lady who had been born in India. (Frances had a love affair on the voyage, unwittingly setting the pattern for countless women who came after her.) Over the years, India drew a few women looking for work&#x2014;as milliners, perhaps, or governesses. And some women had a calling to be missionaries. Others simply went because they had been summoned back by their families after an education in Britain.<br><br>The great majority, however, went to India because their husbands were there or because they hoped to find husbands for themselves. (To keep them chaste for the marriage market, unmarried women traveled, until well into the twentieth century, under the care of chaperones, usually married women who were making the voyage anyway.) The &#x201c;fishing fleet,&#x201d; as it was known unkindly but accurately by the nineteenth century, arrived in India in the autumn at the start of the cold weather. One lady who came out in 1779 divided what she called &#x201c;the speculative ladies&#x201d; into old maids, &#x201c;of the shrivelled and dry description,&#x201d; and girls, &#x201c;educated merely to cover the surface of their mental deformity.&#x201d; The odds were that their fishing would meet success: throughout the period of British rule in India, European men outnumbered European women by about three to one.<br><br>Understandably, few British women had cared to come to the unsettled India of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries; and, what is more, the early charters of the East India Company pointedly forbade women on its posts. Its employees ignored that regulation as they did so many others. They took Indian mistresses; worse, from the point of view of the Company&#x2019;s staunch Protestant directors, they married Catholics, daughters or widows of the Portuguese. To save the souls of its men, the Company, for a time, played matchmaker. In the later part of the seventeenth century it shipped batches of young women from Britain to India. The cargo, divided into &#x201c;gentlewomen&#x201d; and &#x201c;others,&#x201d; were given one set of clothes each and were supported for a year&#x2014;quite long enough, it was thought, for them to find themselves husbands. Some did not; and the Company tried to deny that it had any obligation to look after them further. Most unfairly it also warned them to mind their morals: &#x201c;Whereas some of these women are grown scandalous to our nation, religion and Government interest,&#x201d; said a letter from London to the Deputy Governor of Bombay in 1675, &#x201c;we require you to give them fair warning that they do apply themselves to a more sober and Christian conversation.&#x201d; If that warning did not have the right effect, the women were to be fed on bread and water and shipped back to Britain. The experiment was not a happy one and it must have been with relief that the Company abandoned the practice in the eighteenth century. British women still traveled to India but they came individually.<br><br>The voyage was a dreadful one. The wooden sailing vessels, tiny by today&#x2019;s standards, were tossed about in every storm&#x2014;and the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean were famous for their storms. The passengers faced at best being thrown about in their cabins, at worst drowning. The Reverend Hobart Caunter recorded one such storm, which took place off the east coast of India in the 1830s. The weather began to turn foul early one morning. &#x201c;The only lady among us every now and then expressed her fears, when a sudden gust caused the vessel to lurch with an increased momentum, as if the billows were already commencing a fiercer conflict.&#x201d; By late afternoon, they were in the midst of a full-blown hurricane. The ship pitched violently and furniture was torn from its fastenings. More dangerously, a cannon got loose and threatened to batter a hole in the side. Even Caunter, a seasoned traveler, found the noise, coupled with the crashing of waves and the howling of the wind, &#x201c;painful in the extreme.&#x201d; Night came on and the storm increased in fury. As Caunter and the captain were in the main cabin, or cuddy, trying to carry on a conversation, &#x201c;suddenly, a heavy sea struck her astern, but happily on the quarter, and in an instant carried away the quarter-galley on that side, swamping the cabin into which the poor lady before spoken of had retired for the night. The force of the water was so great, that it dashed open the door of the cabin, and its fair occupant was borne head foremost into the cuddy, dripping like a mermaid, her hair hanging about her shoulders in thin strips, when she was rescued by the captain from further mischief. She was drenched to the skin.&#x201d;<br><br>At its shortest the voyage under sail took under two months; at its longest well over six. Sometimes the winds were so contrary on the west coast of Africa that the ships were blown off course almost to Brazil. The crew and passengers gasped with the heat; then, when they were rounding the Cape of Good Hope, they shivered in the cold. There was the danger of being dashed against the shore by a sudden shift in the winds. Those who survived often ended up in the great slave markets along the east coast of Africa. Occasionally the winds might fail altogether and the unhappy ship would sit becalmed for weeks on end.<br><br>Accommodations were cramped and dirty and often had to be shared with huge rats which scurried about, boldly eating any food that was left out and nibbling holes in clothing. Women who could afford it had cabins abovedecks. Otherwise they were housed below, in stuffy cubbyholes, often with walls made of canvas, where they had very little privacy. A bucket of salt water was the closest passengers got to a wash tub; another bucket made do for a toilet. Mrs. Sherwood, later famous as a writer of sentimental children&#x2019;s stories, accompanied her army officer husband out to India at the beginning of the nineteenth century; she had to sleep in a hammock strung above a cannon while filthy water from the bilges ran across the floor beneath.<br><br>Mrs. Eliza Fay, who lived in India in the late eighteenth century, endured the voyage several times. Fortunately she was a woman who faced difficulties (and she had many&#x2014;from imprisonment by an Indian ruler to her wastrel of a husband) in an optimistic spirit. Her letters to her sister are filled with cheerful gossip and appalling details of shipboard life. On one voyage back to England, she nearly suffocated. &#x201c;The port of my cabin being kept almost constantly shut, and the door opening into the steerage; I had neither light nor air but from a scuttle.&#x201d; On her first voyage the captain was &#x201c;overbearing and insolent&#x201d; and kept his passengers half starved. At meals, Mrs. Fay reported proudly, &#x201c;the longest arm fared best; and you cannot imagine what a good scrambler I am become.&#x201d;<br><br>When they could, women on the sailing ships escaped from their cabins to the fresh air of the deck, but that depended on both the weather and the mood of the captain. Many of the captains of the East Indiamen were quite charmingly eccentric on dry land; at sea they seemed half mad and one of their more common phobias was women. Ladies were often forced to take their meals in their cabins rather than in the cuddy because the gentlemen drank and swore so dreadfully. Mrs. Sherwood confided to her diary that &#x201c;those who have not been at sea can never conceive the hundredth part of the horrors of a long voyage to a female in a sailing vessel.&#x201d;<br><br>At the start of the voyage, there might be the luxury of fresh meat, because many ships carried cows and sheep on deck. Sooner or later, rations would get shorter, the preserved meat tougher and saltier. Water would turn the color of strong tea, with a foul smell and an even fouler taste. Minnie Blane, a happy, sheltered young middle- class girl from Bath, experienced all the unpleasantness of sailing ships when she traveled out to India in 1856 with her husband, an officer in the Indian Army. (They might have taken the shorter route overland via Egypt and enjoyed the relative comfort of steamships but her husband needed to save money.) Minnie, who was pregnant, was sick a good deal of the time and the meals she faced cannot have helped. For weeks on end, after they had rounded the Cape, the only meat was &#x201c;Pork, boiled, roasted, fried, chops, curry (with so much garlic in it, it is quite uneatable), and one leg of mutton, half raw.&#x201d; The butter was thick with salt and sugar had long since run out. Some food was quite rotten. &#x201c;I cannot tell you,&#x201d; wrote Minnie to her mother, &#x201c;how sick it made me one day, on cutting open a fig, to see three or four large white maggots lying comfortably inside!&#x201d; Cautious travelers often took a private stock of food and wine. Many women brought other little comforts along in a brave attempt to make their quarters bearable. They had their own folding chairs, washstands, linen, and even chintz curtains to hang across the door.<br><br>Soldiers&#x2019; wives had the worst time of all. The Army&#x2019;s own troopships were appalling&#x2014;leaking, dirty, and cramped&#x2014;and the transports it sometimes had to hire from private contractors were scarcely better. Since the usual class distinctions were rigidly observed at sea, officers&#x2019; ladies at least got cabins; &#x201c;wives of others ranks,&#x201d; as the Army described them, were belowdecks, often in a corner of the hold next to the horses. There they endured the voyage, sleeping, eating, and passing their days in a stench which got worse as the voyage dragged on. Unless they were working for an officer&#x2019;s wife, they had little opportunity of getting on deck.<br><br>The military authorities of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries did not approve of women and their children accompanying the troops&#x2014;only a few of the families of the ranks were permitted to go&#x2014;so they did little to make them comfortable. The Army gave them a pittance for their subsistence but no advice on what to bring with them. Mrs. Helen Mackenzie, the strong-minded and pious wife of an officer in a Sikh regiment, was horrified on her first voyage to India in the middle of the nineteeth century to discover a soldier&#x2019;s wife eating the scraps from her plate. The unfortunate woman was &#x201c;worse off than a female convict&#x201d;: she did not even have adequate clothing.<br><br>Gradually the Army was forced to modify its attitude; by the twentieth century wives usually accompanied their husbands abroad and the troopships, while never luxurious, gave them at least decent food and accommodation. After the First World War, conditions were better still; the Army even provided free baby food on board ship.<br><br>It is not surprising that passengers on those early voyages in sailing ships vented their misery and boredom in violent quarrels with each other. The men threatened each other with duels; the women gossiped viciously and absurdly cut each other dead. Every now and then there were more agreeable moments. If it was calm, the passengers danced on the deck under the stars. They celebrated &#x201c;crossing the line,&#x201d; when male passengers who had never crossed the equator before were ceremonially shaved by Neptune and his court. The biggest sailors played Mrs. Neptune and her daughters. The gentlemen were shaved with a saw and a tar brush and ducked in a tub of salt water while the ladies watched from a safe distance. Mrs. Ashmore, the prim wife of an officer, witnessed the merriment when she traveled out to India in 1840, though the scene &#x201c;soon became of too riotous a nature to admit of our remaining witnesses to it.&#x201d; (She retired to her favorite reading&#x2014;the works of Bishop Berkeley and Volney&#x2019;s Ruins of Empire.)<br><br>Occasionally (and not always by design) the ships put in briefly to shore. St. Helena in the South Atlantic was a popular spot to pick up provisions and water. The passengers could stretch their legs briefly; if they had time they might make a trip to Napoleon&#x2019;s tomb (at least until the bones were restored to the French in 1840). The Cape of Good Hope was another regular stop. The ships tied up at Simonstown, then a pretty little fishing village, and passengers hired carriages to take them to Constantia, where there were excellent local wines, and to Cape Town with its charming houses set in tidy gardens. The Dutch settlers, various ladies noted approvingly, preserved both the simple ways and the hospitality of their ancestors.<br><br>There was a much shorter way of getting to India, by boat across the Mediterranean, then by land across the narrow strip of Egypt that divided the Mediterranean from the Red Sea, and finally by boat again across the Indian Ocean. This route was first used in the eighteenth century and was eventually to supplant the one around the Cape. At first it presented as many hazards as the longer route, because Egypt, nominally under the control of the Ottoman Sultan, was quite lawless. Passengers for India gathered in Cairo until they were a large enough party to defy the bandits who lay in wait in the desert. Sometimes they joined forces with Egyptian merchants heading in the same direction. The caravans traveled with an escort of hired Arab soldiers. The men generally rode while the ladies were jolted about in a sort of litter, slung between two camels. In spite of a canopy and blinds, the unfortunate occupants nearly stifled in the heat of the day only to shudder in the sudden chill of the desert night. Mrs. Fay, who traveled in one of these in the 1770s, remembered with particular antipathy &#x201c;the frequent violent jerks, occasioned by one or other of the poles slipping out of its wretched fastening, so as to bring one end of the litter to the ground.&#x201d; In later years, men and women bounced together across the desert in crude horse-drawn vans; later still there was a railway.<br><br>The journey became much safer and much faster as the nineteenth century wore on. In 1830 the first steamer was put into service between Suez, at the head of the Red Sea, and Bombay. In 1840, the Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Company signed an agreement with the government of India to provide a regular service between Suez and certain Indian ports. The P&amp;O was in time to become almost synonymous with the journey to India, but there were other lines: the Anchor and the Clan Lines, which ran between Liverpool and Bombay, the Calcutta Star Line between Liverpool and Colombo, and (generally considered by the British inferior to all these) the Italian Rubatino Line from Genoa and Naples to Bombay. Steam and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 helped to shorten the trip to four weeks and even less and the whole experience became rather enjoyable. The author of Indian Outfits, a guide for women published in 1882, was quite rhapsodic. &#x201c;To those who like the sea, the voyage is very pleasant; there are generally many nice people on board, and, if troops are carried, sometimes a band, and on fine nights dancing on deck, or singing, glee parties, and so on; very often amateur theatricals are got up, and come off the night before port is reached. There is usually a library on board, and there is no reason why, with so much that is new to interest and with pleasant society, the time should not pass quickly and agreeably.&#x201d;</p><h2>Union and Communion: or Thoughts on the Song of Solomon (Annotated)</h2><p><p><b>Union and Communion: or Thoughts on the Song of Solomon</b></p>This is <i>Hudson&#x2019;s Taylor's</i> commentary on the <i>Song of Songs</i>.

Since the Enlightenment, mythology has been regarded as the province of more primitive minds&#x2014;something humanity has moved beyond in its embrace of scientific methodology. But has science been successful in purging contemporary civilization of all myths? I don&#x2019;t believe that it has or likely ever will.<br>In fact, although we depend on the objectivity of science, scientifically influenced fields such as medicine are often rife with their own myths and misapprehensions. This is because, as the anthropologist Claude L�vi-Strauss1 believed, every myth&#x2014;whether it be about a god hurling a lightning bolt from a mountain, a hero undertaking harrowing adventures filled with sirens, storms, and ferocious beasts, or a generation of scientists trying to fight a peculiar disease of old age&#x2014;is driven by the need to address the complexities of the human condition and to try to resolve paradoxes that perplex us. In our modern age, in which remarkable scientific and technological advances have both extended and brought quality to human lives, we find major challenges to our rationality and values as science attempts to understand our own mysterious organ of rational thought&#x2014;the brain&#x2014;and the very processes of brain aging. From out of the depths of this paradox, a hundred-year-old monster has risen; it is called &#x201c;Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease.&#x201d; <br>The myth of alzheimer&#x2019;s<br>Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease represents our culture&#x2019;s attempt to make sense of a natural process (brain aging) that we cannot control. Just as past civilizations posited mythical explanations for natural events they could not explain, we have created an antagonist: a terrorizing disease of the brain that our scientists are fighting against. The pillars of the myth are as follows: <br>AD is a singular disease<br>Despite widespread belief that there is a disease called Alzheimer&#x2019;s against which science is waging war, what the public isn&#x2019;t told is that so-called Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease cannot be differentiated from normal aging and that no two illness courses are the same. As you will learn, there is no one biological profile of Alzheimer&#x2019;s that is consistent from person to person, and all the biological hallmarks of AD are also the hallmarks of normal brain aging. <br>People &#x201c;get&#x201d; Alzheimer&#x2019;s in old age<br>It seems as if more people fall victim to Alzheimer&#x2019;s each year. Newspapers and magazines would have us believe that Alzheimer&#x2019;s is spreading throughout human populations, and especially baby boomers, like an epidemic and claiming millions more victims.<br>However, what you aren&#x2019;t told is that we don&#x2019;t even know how to diagnose Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, let alone tabulate the numbers of disease victims. Because there is no single biological profile for AD, every clinical diagnosis is considered &#x201c;probable&#x201d;&#x2014;and, frankly speaking, not even postmortem examination can differentiate a so-called AD victim from those who have aged normally. Hence, the claim that a diagnosis of &#x201c;definite&#x201d; Alzheimer&#x2019;s can be made after death is itself questionable. The gold standard of neuropathology is a bit tarnished. No one really ever &#x201c;gets&#x201d; a singular disease called Alzheimer&#x2019;s, and there is no evidence that Alzheimer&#x2019;s is spreading throughout the baby boomer population other than the fact that the world is aging and there are more middle-aged people at risk for brain-aging phenomena. <br>We can cure Alzheimer&#x2019;s through the continued <br>investment of our public and private dollars <br>The myth that Alzheimer&#x2019;s is a disease separate from aging also carries the promise that science will one day win the &#x201c;war&#x201d; against this disease. But if Alzheimer&#x2019;s cannot be differentiated from normal brain aging, to cure AD we would literally have to arrest the natural process of brain aging. I am not alone in casting doubt upon this myth. As you will read, even scientists in the Alzheimer&#x2019;s research field will tell you that a cure is unlikely and that we need to invest our dollars more wisely by putting them toward prevention and care rather than predominantly in cure. However, like the myth of the Fountain of Youth, which captivated past civilizations, the promise of a panacea for one of our most dreaded &#x201c;diseases&#x201d; is a powerful cultural myth, and one purveyed by powerful pharmaceutical companies, advocacy organizations, and private researchers with much profit to gain. It is a myth we have been seduced by, and the combination of hype and fear it inspires has distorted our expectations and understandings about our aging brains. <br>My Story<br>For nearly twenty-five years, I have served as a leader in the Alzheimer&#x2019;s field, and have helped international Alzheimer&#x2019;s organizations and pharmaceutical companies shape the rules, guidelines, diagnostic categories, and accepted clinical approaches to Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. My experiences and relationships with other colleagues have endowed me with some influence and power and have enabled me to become what the science community calls a &#x201c;thought leader&#x201d; (or KOL&#x2014;&#x201c;key opinion leader&#x201d;)&#x2014;one who guides our conventional thinking about a particular condition.<br>In the beginning of my career, at a time when no medicines had been approved specifically for Alzheimer&#x2019;s and companies were unsure about how to proceed in drug development, the pharmaceutical industry reached out to me and listened to my thoughts and opinions about treating persons with memory challenges. Once drugs made their way to the market in the 1990s the relationship shifted. Rather than being interested in having my thoughts influence their views, it seemed as if industry wanted to change my mind and convince me that their drugs were worth giving to my patients. This focus on biological approaches to brain aging across our society has shifted the whole dynamic of the field away from caring for the aging patient and his family and toward drugs as the primary means of ensuring the quality of his life. Too often, aging patients and their families leave the doctor&#x2019;s office with little more than a pill prescription (often encompassing several pills) and fear generated by the Alzheimer&#x2019;s myth, knowing little about how to effectively care for the condition. <br>This is inhumane and inexcusable.<br>Now, upon the one hundredth anniversary of the first case of Alzheimer&#x2019;s, I feel obliged to share my stories and the insight I have gained, to inform the general public how I&#x2014;a lifelong Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease researcher and clinician&#x2014;have evolved to espouse a different ideological position that transforms a significant portion of what I&#x2019;ve believed in as a professional carer for patients. Having spent my life within the scientific, political, economic, and social institutions of the AD field&#x2014;universities, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies&#x2014;studying and treating human aging and disease, I am ready to challenge the power that the mainstream &#x201c;Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease&#x201d; myth has over us and help people see what I have seen and to think critically about the evolution in thought that has occurred over the past several decades, which has shaped the way we see our aging bodies and minds and the way we act toward them. I want to articulate a story of brain aging that can be a starting point for helping us better cope with and prepare for the travails of cognitive decline.<br>No longer can we safely assume that the march of progress in the &#x201c;War against AD&#x201d; is moving at the hoped for speed or direction; no longer can we maintain the mythical illusion that AD is a battle against a specific disease that we will eventually &#x201c;win&#x201d;; no longer can we keep looking at aging persons, however embattled, as somehow &#x201c;diseased.&#x201d; Defining brain aging as a disease and then trying to cure it is at its root unscientific and misguided. In short, Alzheimer&#x2019;s is a hundred-year old myth that is over the hill. The entire scientific, technological, and political framework for aging needs to be reassessed to better serve patients and families in order to help people maximize their quality of life as they move along the path of cognitive aging.

At the time, I had everything I thought would make me happy&#x2014;the job, the apartment, the life. My closet was full of impressive corporate clothing, and my business card carried the name of a prestigious company that garnered respect in every room I entered. I looked like a guy on the right path who was most likely walking into the bank to deposit his monthly paycheck.<br> <br>But deep down inside, I was no longer enamored with the life I&#x2019;d created. The only purpose I was serving was self-interest. While I rarely showed it to outsiders, my happiness waned day after day. A restless voice kept me up at night, telling me that until I found meaning, the money wouldn&#x2019;t matter. It told me that I&#x2019;d find far more fulfillment if I measured my life in purpose, not profits. And that I didn&#x2019;t have to keep waiting, that now was the perfect moment to start chasing my biggest dreams.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s strange how you can sometimes feel a yearning that seems bigger than your actual body. That&#x2019;s how I felt that day. I wanted to be a part of something that extended far beyond my two hands and the possessions they could hold. No matter how scared I was of getting off my safe path, I needed to see what would happen if I finally stepped into the uncharted territory where unbridled ambition and opportunity reside.<br> <br>The scariest part was that I wasn&#x2019;t some successful businessman who&#x2019;d built and sold companies. I didn&#x2019;t have a lengthy career to prove I would succeed. Nor did I have millions of dollars in financial backing. I was just a regular guy with $25 who wanted to prove that regardless of age, status, or location, every person has the capacity to change the world. So I used that small amount to open a new account in hopes of one day building a school. Everything that came after was a result of that first step. That leap of faith rippled outward, spanning cultures and continents.<br> <br>Since then I&#x2019;ve immersed myself in the field of global education. I believe that where you start in life should not dictate where you finish. And that no tool can more profoundly unlock a person&#x2019;s ability to change his or her place in life than access to quality education. The good news is that we have the ability to provide quality education to every child on earth right now. We are not looking for a miracle vaccine or drilling for a hidden resource that may not exist. We have all the tools necessary at this very moment. Yet we still have 57 million children out of school, and millions more who sit in classrooms each day but remain illiterate.<br> <br>Education is a complex issue, which requires a complex set of solutions. There is no silver-bullet answer to educating the children of the world, but the global education crisis remains the single most solvable and important human rights issue of our time. The knowledge that it can be solved gives me hope and purpose. But no individual can solve the world&#x2019;s problems alone. A collective effort is required, and we each have a unique role to play.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>This is the story about what happens when you acknowledge that there&#x2019;s more for you to become, and that you don&#x2019;t have to have enormous resources to make a difference in the world. It&#x2019;s a story about what can unfold when inspiration strikes and you realize that the rewards of living a purposeful life are rich and lasting. It&#x2019;s the story of my life (although I have changed the names of several people at their request), but it&#x2019;s a story that can belong to anyone.<br> <br>Each of the thirty chapters in this book is titled with a mantra. These mantras have served as my guideposts as I&#x2019;ve faced decisions both large and small. They have become my essential truths. I&#x2019;ve written them with the hope that they will be carried forward, shared with others, and adopted in ways that help you on your own journey as well. Each story stands on its own, but taken together they create a roadmap that I hope will enable you to turn your own dreams into reality.<br> <br>If one of these stories ignites something within you, listen to that restless feeling that your head may tell you to ignore but your heart will tell you to pursue. The biggest difference between the person who lives his or her dreams and the person who aspires is the decision to convert that first spark of motivation into immediate action. Take the first small step, then chase the footprints you aspire to leave behind. Every person has a revolution beating within his or her chest. I hope that this book helps you find yours.</p><h2>She Sheds (mini edition): A DIY Guide for Huts, Hideaways, and Garden Escapes Created by Women for Women</h2><p><p><b>Create your very own hideaway for relaxing, crafting, reading, or just to have a private place just for you. <i>She Sheds</i> provides the instruction and inspiration in this lovely gift-able edition.</b></p><p>They've got their man caves, and<b> it's time for you to have a space of your own</b>. <i>She Sheds</i> shows you how to create cozy getaways with inspiration from across the country.

Told through Judy's letters and illustrated by her own quaint drawings, <b>DADDY-LONG-LEGS</b> is a profound and tender homage to the power of awakening love.</p><p><b>Jean Webster</b> (1875-1916) was born in Fredonia, New York, the daughter of Charles L. Webster, who was Mark Twain's publisher and business partner. Educated at Vassar College, she must have been a woman with a strong social conscience, perhaps aroused by her visits as a student to orphanages and other institutions (part of her economics course: her degree was in English and economics). She was always concerned for the plight of children who began life with such disadvantages and later she served on committees for prison reform and regularly visited Sing Sing jail. She wrote a number of novels that are now forgotten, but the last two, <b>Daddy-Long-Legs</b> (1912) and its sequel <b>Dear Enemy</b> (1915), have survived both in book form, stage and film versions, and a British musical comedy Love from Judy produced in 1953. In 1915 Jean Webster married Glenn Ford McKinney. She died a year later, the day after the birth of her daughter."Blue Wednesday"<br><br> The first Wednesday in every month was a Perfectly Awful Day--a day to be awaited with dread, endured with courage and forgotten with haste. Every floor must be spotless, every chair dustless, and every bed without a wrinkle. Ninety-seven squirming little orphans must be scrubbed and combed and buttoned into freshly starched ginghams; and all ninety-seven reminded of their manners, and told to say, "Yes, sir," "No, sir," whenever a Trustee spoke.<br><br> It was a distressing time; and poor Jerusha Abbott, being the oldest orphan, had to bear the brunt of it. But this particular first Wednesday, like its predecessors, finally dragged itself to a close. Jerusha escaped from the pantry where she had been making sandwiches for the asylum's guests, and turned upstairs to accomplish her regular work. Her special care was room F, where eleven little tots, from four to seven, occupied eleven little cots set in a row. Jerusha assembled her charges, straightened their rumpled frocks, wiped their noses, and started them in an orderly and willing line toward the dining-room to engage themselves for a blessed half hour with bread and milk and prune pudding.<br><br> Then she dropped down on the window seat and leaned throbbing temples against the cool glass. She had been on her feet since five that morning, doing everybody's bidding, scolded and hurried by a nervous matron. Mrs. Lippett, behind the scenes, did not always maintain that calm and pompous dignity with which she faced an audience of Trustees and lady visitors. Jerusha gazed out across a broad stretch of frozen lawn, beyond the tall iron paling that marked the confines of the asylum, down undulating ridges sprinkled with country estates, to the spires of the village rising from the midst of bare trees.<br><br> The day was ended--quite successfully, so far as she knew. The Trustees and the visiting committee had made their rounds, and read their reports, and drunk their tea, and now were hurrying home to their own cheerful firesides, to forget their bothersome little charges for another month. Jerusha leaned forward watching with curiosity--and a touch of wistfulness--the stream of carriages and automobiles that rolled out of the asylum gates. In imagination she followed first one equipage, then another, to the big houses dotted along the hillside. She pictured herself in a fur coat and a velvet hat trimmed with feathers leaning back in the seat and nonchalantly murmuring "Home" to the driver. But on the door-sill of her home the picture grew blurred.<br><br> Jerusha had an imagination--an imagination, Mrs. Lippett told her, that would get her into trouble if she didn't take care--but keen as it was, it could not carry her beyond the front porch of the houses she would enter. Poor, eager, adventurous little Jerusha, in all her seventeen years, had never stepped inside an ordinary house; she could not picture the daily routine of those other human beings who carried on their lives undiscommoded by orphans.<br> Je-ru-sha Ab-bott You are wan-ted In the of-fice, And I think you'd Better hurry up!<br> Tommy Dillon, who had joined the choir, came singing up the stairs and down the corridor, his chant growing louder as he approached room F. Jerusha wrenched herself from the window and refaced the troubles of life.<br><br> "Who wants me?" she cut into Tommy's chant with a note of sharp anxiety.<br> Mrs. Lippett in the office, And I think she's mad. Ah-a-men!<br> Tommy piously intoned, but his accent was not entirely malicious. Even the most hardened little orphan felt sympathy for an erring sister who was summoned to the office to face an annoyed matron; and Tommy liked Jerusha even if she did sometimes jerk him by the arm and nearly scrub his nose off.<br><br> Jerusha went without comment, but with two parallel lines on her brow. What could have gone wrong, she wondered. Were the sandwiches not thin enough? Were there shells in the nut cakes? Had a lady visitor seen the hole in Susie Hawthorn's stocking? Had--O horrors!--one of the cherubic little babes in her own room F "sassed" a Trustee?<br><br> The long lower hall had not been lighted, and as she came downstairs, a last Trustee stood, on the point of departure, in the open door that led to the porte-cochere. Jerusha caught only a fleeting impression of the man--and the impression consisted entirely of tallness. He was waving his arm toward an automobile waiting in the curved drive. As it sprang into motion and approached, head on for an instant, the glaring headlights threw his shadow sharply against the wall inside. The shadow pictured grotesquely elongated legs and arms that ran along the floor and up the wall of the corridor. It looked, for all the world, like a huge, wavering daddy-long-legs.<br><br> Jerusha's anxious frown gave place to quick laughter. She was by nature a sunny soul, and had always snatched the tiniest excuse to be amused. If one could derive any sort of entertainment out of the oppressive fact of a Trustee, it was something unexpected to the good. She advanced to the office quite cheered by the tiny episode, and presented a smiling face to Mrs. Lippett. To her surprise the matron was also, if not exactly smiling, at least appreciably affable; she wore an expression almost as pleasant as the one she donned for visitors.<br><br> "Sit down, Jerusha, I have something to say to you."<br><br> Jerusha dropped into the nearest chair and waited with a touch of breathlessness. An automobile flashed past the window; Mrs. Lippett glanced after it.<br><br> "Did you notice the gentleman who has just gone?"<br><br> "I saw his back."<br><br> "He is one of our most affluential Trustees, and has given large sums of money toward the asylum's support. I am not at liberty to mention his name; he expressly stipulated that he was to remain unknown."<br><br> Jerusha's eyes widened slightly; she was not accustomed to being summoned to the office to discuss the eccentricities of Trustees with the matron.<br><br> "This gentleman has taken an interest in several of our boys. You remember Charles Benton and Henry Freize? They were both sent through college by Mr.--er--this Trustee, and both have repaid with hard work and success the money that was so generously expended. Other payment the gentleman does not wish. Heretofore his philanthropies have been directed solely toward the boys; I have never been able to interest him in the slightest degree in any of the girls in the institution, no matter how deserving. He does not, I may tell you, care for girls."<br><br> "No, ma'am," Jerusha murmured, since some reply seemed to be expected at this point.<br><br> "To-day at the regular meeting, the question of your future was brought up."</p><h2>Adventure Time Vol. 15 (15)</h2><p>Princess Bubblegum starts a hot air balloon race across all of Ooo against Finn and Jake.&nbsp;<br><br>The hottest race in all of Ooo!<br> <br>When Princess Bubblegum gets a mysterious map and decides to turn it into a hot air balloon race around Ooo, it was only a matter of time before something went wrong.

Meanwhile, in the Scottish Highlands, the MacRinnalch Clan is plotting and feuding after the head of the clan suddenly dies intestate. As the court intrigue threatens to blow up into all-out civil war, the competing factions determine that Kalix is the swing vote necessary to assume leadership of the clan. Unfortunately, Kalix isn&#x2019;t really into clan politics laudanum&#x2019;s more her thing. Even more unfortunately, Kalix is the reason the head of the clan ended up dead, which is why she&#x2019;s now on the lam in London. . . This expansive tale of werewolves in the modern world friendly werewolves, fashionista werewolves, troubled teenage werewolves, cross-dressing werewolves, werewolves of every sort is hard-edged, hilarious, and utterly believable.</p><p>Martin Millar was born in Scotland and now lives in London. He is the author of such novels as Lonely Werewolf Girl, Curse of the Wolf Girl and The Good Fairies of New York. Under the pseudonym of Martin Scott, he, as the Guardian put it, &#39;invented a new genre: pulp fantasy noir&#39;. Thraxas, the first book in his Thraxas series, won the World Fantasy Award in 2000.

Visit Martin Millar at: www.martinmillar.com www.facebook.com/martin.millar www.twitter.com.MartinMillar1*Starred Review* The MacRinnalch clan of Scottish werewolves is at war with itself. Attacked by his 17-year-old daughter, Kalix, the thane has succumbed, leaving the succession in question. Neither eldest son Sarapen nor younger, cross-dressing scion Markus have enough votes in the werewolves&#x2019; Great Council to become thane, and the late thane&#x2019;s mother offers her vote to whomever brings her Kalix&#x2019;s heart. Kalix, despondent over losing her lover to exile, is on the verge of suicide before either bounty hunters or the secret society that hunts werewolves finds her. After she&#x2019;s rescued by college students Moonglow and Daniel, things take a curious turn to, among other things, her sister Thrix, a werewolf enchantress and couturier for fashion-obsessed fire-elemental warrior queen Malveria. This complex romp features scores of characters, multiple races, enchanting fashion trappings, business, family dynamics, music, sex, enduring love, romance, business, eating disorders, drug addiction, back-alley fights, epic battles, politics, and, most prominently, the contrary nature of werewolves, not to mention 236 (!) chapters. And it&#x2019;s so compelling you don&#x2019;t want to it end. The grungy, gory, glorious world that World Fantasy Award winner Millar has created is unforgettable. --Diana Tixier Herald</p><h2>Eugene Braunwald and the Rise of Modern Medicine</h2><p><p>Since the 1950s, the death rate from heart attacks has plunged from 35 percent to about 5 percent--and fatalistic attitudes toward this disease and many others have faded into history. Much of the improved survival and change in attitudes can be traced to the work of Eugene Braunwald, MD. In the 1960s, he proved that myocardial infarction was not a "bolt from the blue" but a dynamic process that plays out over hours and thus could be altered by treatment. By redirecting cardiology from passive, risk-averse observation to active intervention, he helped transform not just his own field but the culture of American medicine.</p><p>Braunwald's personal story demonstrates how the forces of history affected the generation of researchers responsible for so many medical advances in the second half of the twentieth century. In 1938 Nazi occupiers forced his family to flee Vienna for Brooklyn. Because of Jewish quotas in medical schools, he was the last person admitted to his class, but went on to graduate number one. When the Doctor Draft threatened to interrupt his medical training during the Korean War, he joined the National Institutes of Health instead of the Navy, and there he began the research that made him the most influential cardiologist of his time.</p><p>In <i>Eugene Braunwald and the Rise of Modern Medicine, </i>Thomas H. Lee offers insights that only authoritative firsthand interviews can provide, to bring us closer to this iconic figure in modern medicine.</p></p><p>Thomas H. Lee is Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Network President at Partners HealthCare.A splendid biography of the pioneer cardiovascular researcher. <b>Lee</b> is highly knowledgeable, a clear writer, and Eugene Braunwald is an absorbing subject--brilliant, resourceful, and idealistic. <i>Eugene Braunwald and the Rise of Modern Medicine</i> is a compelling story, and I found myself increasingly fascinated. (David McCullough, two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Biography)<br><br>Eugene Braunwald remains far too little-known. The span of his work in cardiology has transformed medicine and human life. And <b>Tom Lee</b> has wrapped Braunwald's life story in the tale of how American medicine changed the world, giving us a book that is as engrossing as it is inspiring. (Atul Gawande)<br><br>A pioneering 1971 study on myocardial infarction revealed that a heart attack is a process rather than a sudden karate chop, and hence eminently treatable. Eugene Braunwald's finding has helped to cut U.S. heart-attack death rates from more than 30% to less than 10%. The story of the cardiologist's life and work, set against a background of rapid change in medicine, is told engagingly by medic <b>Thomas Lee</b>. Braunwald has lived several lives since his 1938 escape from Nazi-controlled Austria, from glory years at the U.S. National Institutes of Health to his active ninth decade.<br> (<i>Nature</i> 2013-09-05)<br><br>An interesting retrospective about the changing nature of medicine and doctoring in American society through the well-told biography of one exemplary physician.<br> (Aaron Klink <i>Library Journal</i> 2013-09-01)<br><br>[<b>Lee</b>] attempts to capture both the life of this remarkable man, now 84, and the explosive scientific progress that fundamentally altered medicine in the second half of the 20th century...[Braunwald] became a leader in medicine&#x2019;s cultural shift toward relying less on experience and more on rigorous science...Lee&#x2019;s book is thoroughly researched and well-written. (Abraham Verghese <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2013-10-25)<br><br>This well-written and well-researched book uses the personal history of Eugene Braunwald (1929-) to describe the development of many of today&#x2019;s medical advances. <b>Lee</b> describes how the changing trends in society at large and the medical profession shaped medical research, health care funding, and even the process for men and women to enter the medical profession...The book is a delight to read since the author recorded this oral history directly from Braunwald himself. The fascinating story of his life as a physician and his rise as one of the most influential cardiologists of modern times, as well as the discussion of the medical profession, makes this a must read for all health care professionals.

Along with Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich, Denton is a partner in Lupa Osteria Romano, one of New York City's best Italian restaurants, as well as the newly opened Bar Milano. <em>Food &amp; Wine</em>, in their annual tastemaker awards, dubbed Denton an "Italian food emissary."

Known for their magic with a panini grill, the couple have put together an accessible, comprehensive guide to the ingredients and techniques (often involving a panini grill) that yield their delicious signature variations on the Italian pressed sandwich, such as Italian Tuna, Oven-Roasted Tomato and Arugula Panini; Sweet Coppa and Hot Pepper Panini; and Artichoke, Fennel and Fontina Panini. They also offer an array of open-faced bruschetti, from Caponata and Goat Cheese Bruschetta to Fig, Prosciutto and Arugula Bruschetta. Less familiar are tramezzini, crustless white bread sandwiches that are a popular Italian between-meal snack, and the book offers an entire section on these oft-ignored finger sandwiches, from savory combos such as Pancetta, Arugula and Oven-Roasted Tomato Tramezzini to simpler fare such as Egg Salad Tramezzini. Warm and inviting guides to a rustic cuisine they love, the Dentons include sections on aperitifs, antipasti and salads&#x2014;and put the pleasures of an Italian tradition within the reach of every American home cook. 35 full-color photos. <i>(On sale June 27)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Baking was all he knew.</p> <p>"It is life. Bread is the staff of life, our most basic food."</p> <p>"And very un-Atkins," said Issy, smoothing her cord skirt down over her hips and sighing. It was one thing for her grandfather to say that. He had spent his whole life skinny as a rake, thanks to a full-time diet of extremely hard physical work that started with lighting the furnace at 5:00 a.m. It was quite another when baking was your hobby, your passion-but to pay the bills you were sitting down in an office all day. It was hard to show restraint when trying out... She drifted off, thinking about the new pineapple cream recipe she'd tried that morning. The trick was to leave enough of the pith in to give the flavor bite, but not so much that it turned into a smoothie. She needed to give it another shot. Issy ran her hands over her cloudy black hair. It went well with her green eyes but created absolute bloody havoc if it rained.</p> <p>"So when you describe what you're making, you must describe life. Do you see? It's not just recipes...next thing you'll tell me you're measuring in metric."</p> <p>Issy bit her lip and made a mental note to hide her metric scales the next time Grampa visited the flat. He'd only get himself worked up.</p> <p>"Are you listening to me?"</p> <p>"Yes, Gramps!"</p> <p>They both turned to look out of the window of the assisted living facility in north London. Issy had installed Joe there when it became clear he was getting too absentminded to live on his own. Issy had hated moving him down south after he'd spent his life in the north, but she needed him close enough to visit. Joe had grumbled of course but he was going to grumble anyway, moving out of his home to anywhere that wouldn't let him rise at 5:00 a.m. and start pounding bread dough. So he might as well be grumpy close by, where she could keep an eye on him. After all, it wasn't as if anyone else was around to do it. And the three bakeries, with their proud, shiny brass handles and old signs proclaiming them to be "electric bakers," were gone now; fallen prey to the supermarkets and chains that favored cheap white pulp over handcrafted but slightly more expensive loaves.</p> <p>As he so often did, Grampa Joe watched the January raindrops fall across the window and read her mind.</p> <p>"Have you heard from...your mother recently?" he said. Issy nodded, noting as ever how hard he found it to say his own daughter's name. Marian had never felt at home as a baker's daughter. And Issy's grandmother had died so young, she hadn't had long enough to provide a steadying influence. With Gramps working all the time, Marian had rebelled before she could even spell the word, hanging out with older boys and bad crowds from her teens, getting pregnant early to a traveling man who had given Issy her black hair and strong eyebrows and absolutely nothing else. Too much of a questing spirit to be tied down, Marian had often left her only child behind while she went off in search of herself.</p> <p>Issy had spent most of her childhood in the bakery, watching Gramps as he manfully beat the dough or delicately shaped the lightest, most mouth-melting filigree cakes and pies. Although he trained bakers for each of his shops, he still liked to get his own hands white with flour, one of the reasons Randalls were once the most popular bakers in Manchester. Issy had spent countless hours doing her homework under the great Cable Street ovens, absorbing through her pores the time and skill and care of a great baker; much more conventional than her mother, she adored her gramps and felt safe and cozy in the kitchens, even though she knew, of course, that she was different from her classmates, who went home to little houses with mums and dads who worked for the council, and dogs and siblings, and ate potato waffles with ketchup in front of Neighbors and didn't wake up before the sun, the smell of warm bread already rising from far below.</p> <p>Now, at thirty-one, Issy had just about forgiven her troubled, untethered mother, even though she of all people should have known what it was like growing up without your mum. She didn't care about the sports days and school outings-everyone knew her grandfather, who never missed one-and she was popular enough, rarely without a cast-off box of scones or French cakes to bring to school occasions, while her birthday party spreads were the stuff of local legend. She did wish someone in her life had cared a little more for fashion-her grandfather bought her two cotton and one woolen dress every Christmas, regardless of age, style, or size, even when everyone else she knew was in legwarmers and Pineapple T-shirts, and her mother would swoop back at regular intervals with strange hippy-style garments that she was selling at festivals, made of hemp or itchy llama wool or something else equally impractical. But Issy never felt short of love in the cozy flat above the bakery where she and Gramps would eat apple pie and watch Dad's Army. Even Marian-who on her flying visits would strictly admonish Issy not to trust men, to stay off the cider, and always follow her rainbow-was a loving parent. Nevertheless, sometimes, when she saw happy families larking in the park or parents cradling their newborns, Issy felt a desire at the pit of her stomach so strong, it felt like a physical gnawing for the traditional, the safe.</p> <p>It was no surprise to anyone who knew the family that Issy Randall grew up to be the straightest, most conventional girl imaginable. Good A-levels, good college, and now a good job with a thrusting commercial property company in the City. By the time she was ready to start work, Gramps's bakeries were all sold: victims of his getting older and the changing times. And she had an education, he had pointed out (sadly, she sometimes thought); she didn't want to be getting up at sparrow's fart and doing hard manual labor for the rest of her life. She was set for better things.</p> <p>But deep down she had a passion for kitchen comforts-for cream horns, balanced with the perfect weight of caterer's cream and light, flaky pastry, set off by the crunchiest diamond crystals of clear sugar; for hot cross buns, baked at Randall's strictly during Lent and Lent only, their cinnamon and raisins and orange peel spreading an exciting, sticky smell to half the road; for a perfectly piped butter icing on top of the highest, lightest, floatiest lemon cupcake. Issy loved all of those things. Hence her project with Gramps: to get as many of his recipes down on paper as possible, before-although neither of them ever referred to it-but before, or in case, he started to forget them.</p> <p>- - -</p> <p>"I got an email from Mum," said Issy. "She's in Florida. She's met a man called Brick. Really. Brick. That's his name."</p> <p>"At least it's a man this time," sniffed her grandfather.</p> <p>Issy gave him a look. "Shhh. She said she might be home for my birthday. In the summer. Of course she said she'd be home for Christmas, but she wasn't."</p> <p>Issy had spent Christmas in the home with Gramps. The staff did their best, but it wasn't all that great.</p> <p>"Anyway." Issy attempted a smile. "She sounds happy. Says she loves it over there. Said I should send you over for some sun."</p> <p>Issy and Gramps looked at each other and burst out laughing. Joe got tired out crossing the room.</p> <p>"Yes," said Gramps, "I'll just go catch the next plane to Florida. Taxi! Take me to London Airport!"</p> <p>Issy tucked the sheet of paper away in her handbag and stood up.</p> <p>"I have to go," she said. "Um, keep doing the recipes. But you can keep them quite, you know, normal if you like."</p> <p>"Normal."</p> <p>She kissed him on the forehead.</p> <p>"See you next week."</p> <p>- - -</p> <p>Issy got off the bus. It was freezing, with dirty ice on the ground left over from a short day's snowfall just after New Year. At first it had looked pretty, but now it was getting a little ropy around the edges, especially poking through the wrought-iron fencing of the Stoke Newington Municipal Offices, the rather grand edifice at the end of her street. Still, as ever, Issy felt pleased to be stepping down. Home, Stoke Newington, the bohemian district she'd stumbled upon when she moved south.</p> <p>The smell of hookahs from the little Turkish caf�s on Stamford Road mingled with the incense sticks from the Everything for a Pound shops, jostling next to expensive baby boutiques that sold children's designer Wellingtons and one-off wooden toys, perused by shoppers with Hasidic ringlets, or headscarves; crop tops and patois; young mothers with buggies; older mothers with double buggies. Despite her friend Tobes once joking that it was like living in the bar in Star Wars, Issy loved it all. She adored the sweet Jamaican bread; the honey baklava sitting out by the cash registers in the grocers; little Indian sweets of dried milk and sugar, or dusty slabs of Turkish delight. She liked the strange cooking smells in the air as she came home from work, and the jumble of buildings; from a handsome square of pretty flat-fronted houses to blocks of flats and red-brick conversions. Albion Road was lined with odd shops, fried chicken joints, cab firms and large gray houses. It was neither commercial nor residential but lay somewhere in between, one of the great winding thoroughfares of London that once upon a time had led to its outlying villages, and now connected its suburbs.</p> <p>The gray houses were stately, Victorian and potentially expensive. Some of them remained grotty subdivided flats with bicycles and damp wheelie bins cluttering up the front gardens. These boasted several doorbells with names crudely taped to them, and recycling boxes piled high on the curb. Some of them, though, had been reconverted into houses and gentrified, with reclaimed oak front doors, topiary trees on the steps and expensive curtains leading to polished hardwood flooring and stripped-back fireplaces and big mirrors. She loved the area's mix of shabby and new, traditional, rough and ready and smart and alternative, with the towers of the City on the horizon, and the tumbledown churchyard and crowded pavements...All types of people lived in Stokey; it felt like a microcosm of London; a village that reflected the city's true heart. And it was more affordable than Islington.</p> <p>Issy had lived here for four years, since she moved out of south London and onto the property ladder. The only downside had been moving out of range of the tube. She'd told herself that didn't matter, but sometimes, on an evening like this with the wind cutting between the houses and turning noses into red dripping taps, she thought perhaps it did. Just a bit. It was all right for the posh yummy mummies in the big gray houses; they all had 4�4s. She did wonder sometimes, when she saw them out with their huge, expensive buggies and tiny, expensive bodies...she did wonder how old they were. Younger than her? Thirty-one wasn't old, not these days. But with their toddlers and their highlights and their houses with one wall covered in smart wallpaper...she did wonder. Sometimes.</p> <p>Just behind the bus stop was a little close. It was lined with tiny shops, older places that had been left behind by the Victorian development. Once upon a time, they would have been stables or produce stores; they were quirky and oddly shaped. There was an ironmonger's with ancient brushes around the door, old-fashioned toasters for sale at inflated prices, and a sad-looking washing machine that had been sitting in the front window for as long as Issy had been coming to the bus stop; a telephone/Wi-Fi/Internet office that stayed open at strange hours and invited you to send money to places; and a newsagent that faced onto the road and was where Issy picked up magazines and Reese's peanut butter cups.</p> <p>Right at the very end of the row, tucked into the corner, was a building that looked like an afterthought, somewhere to use up the spare stones. It was pointed at one end, where a triangular corner of glass stuck out toward the road, widening into a bench, with a door coming out onto a small cobbled courtyard with a tree in it. It looked quite out of place, a tiny haven in the middle of a village square, something absolutely out of time-like, Issy had once reflected, an illustration by Beatrix Potter. All it needed were bottle- glass windows.</p> <p>Wind blew up the main road once more, and Issy turned off toward the flat. Home.</p> <p>- - -</p> <p>Issy had bought her flat at the very height of the property boom. For someone who worked in the property business, it hadn't been very astute. She suspected prices had started to decline about thirty minutes after she'd picked up her keys. This was before she began dating her boyfriend, Graeme, whom she'd met at work (although she had already noticed him around, as had all the other girls in the office); otherwise, as he had said several times, he would certainly have advised her against it.</p> <p>Even then, she wasn't sure she'd have listened to him. After hunting through every property in her price range and hating all of them, she'd been on the point of giving up when she got to Carmelite Avenue, and she'd loved it straightaway. It was the top two stories of one of the pretty gray houses, with its own side entrance up a flight of stairs, so really it felt more like a little house than an apartment. One floor was almost entirely an open-plan kitchen/dining room/sitting room. Issy had made it as cozy as possible, with huge faded gray velvet sofas, a long wooden table with benches, and her beloved kitchen. The units were going cheap in the sales, almost certainly because they were a very strong shade of pink. "Nobody wants a pink kitchen," the salesman had said, slightly sadly. "They just want stainless steel. Or country cottage. There's nothing in between."</p> <p>"I've never seen a pink washing machine before," Issy had said encouragingly. She hated a sad salesman.</p> <p>"I know. Apparently it makes some people feel a bit queasy, watching their washing go around in one of those."</p> <p>"That would be a drawback."</p> <p>"Jordan nearly bought one," he said, momentarily perking up. "Then she decided it was too pink."</p> <p>"Jordan decided it was too pink?" said Issy, who had never thought of herself as a particularly pink and girly type of person. This, however, was such an endearingly full-on Schiaparelli pink. It was a kitchen that just wanted to be loved.</p> <p>"And it's really seventy percent off?" she asked again. "Fitted and everything?"</p> <p>The salesman looked at the pretty girl with the green eyes and the cloud of dark hair. He liked rounded girls. They looked like they would actually cook in his kitchens. He didn't like those sharp ladies who wanted sharp-edged kitchens to keep their gin a...</p></p><h2>Emotional Fitness for Couples: 10 Minutes a Day to a Better Relationship</h2><p><p>The 10-Minute Relationship Workout</p> <p>Peak athletic performance requires regular exercise, and a great relationship depends on regular emotional practice to stay in top form.

Her books have won multiple Agatha, Anthony, and Macavity awards. She has also been honored with the Amelia Award for significant contributions to the traditional mystery from Malice Domestic and was named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America.

She and her husband, Phil, serve as staff&#x2014;cat owners will understand&#x2014;to brother and sister brown tabbies.1<br> &nbsp;<br> The typist nodded. It was finished, as neat a design for murder as could be envisioned. Murder with malice. To be enjoyed by a select group. Well, wasn&#x2019;t it deserved?<br> &nbsp;<br> For an instant, the writer hesitated. Was public humiliation deserved? There was no question as to the answer. And perhaps the effect would be to break the pattern of silken domination, to end the ruthless manipulation masked by charm.<br> &nbsp;<br> A gloved hand gently loosened the last sheet from the typewriter. It was an agreeable irony that the plan should be typed on the old machine that sat in the corner of the director&#x2019;s office of the Chastain Historical Preservation Society. Should these pages ever be linked to this particular typewriter, it would reveal only that the manuscript had been produced on a machine easily accessible to the cream of Chastain&#x2019;s social hierarchy.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the pages were neatly folded and placed in the waiting envelope, the writer read the cover letter again, then painstakingly traced a signature. It took only a moment to slip the letter inside and seal the envelope. Everything was in readiness. As soon as the mystery expert was officially hired, the letter could be mailed.<br> &nbsp;<br> The writer looked up at a wall calendar which pictured the Prichard House, one of Chastain&#x2019;s oldest and loveliest antebellum mansions. A crimson circle marked April 7.<br> &nbsp;<br> 2<br> &nbsp;<br> Idell Gordon tugged restlessly at her sheets. She should have gone to the dentist. Well, too late now. The upper-right back molar throbbed. She kept her eyes squeezed shut, hoping for the blessed release of sleep. But sleep wouldn&#x2019;t come. Finally, wearily, she struggled upright and levered her ungainly body to the edge of the bed, peering at the luminous dial on the bedstand. Almost three o&#x2019;clock. Swinging her legs over the side, she slipped into her scuffed pink satin houseshoes. Oh, her jaw, her jaw. She padded across the room to her bath and reached up for the brown plastic vial of Valium tablets. One of them might help her sleep. She filled a bathroom cup with water and swallowed the tiny pill, then suppressed a groan. It would take a while for the drug to help. She almost walked to her easy chair, but she knew she would feel better if she kept moving. She crossed the room, dodging the potted plants and the rocking chair and the rickety maple whatnot, and opened the French window to step out onto the second-floor balcony. The soft night air swept over her, soothing and calming. It was almost warm enough to walk out in her nightdress, though it was only mid-March, but she grabbed up a shawl that she&#x2019;d thrown over her rocking chair earlier that evening. The moonlight speckled the grounds below, hiding the burgeoning weeds in the beds along this side of the Inn. She sighed. Her back always hurt when she hoed, but she couldn&#x2019;t afford to hire a gardener this spring. Occupancy of the Inn had been down, and it was going to be touch and go on the bills. A little flicker of panic moved in her chest. What was she going to do if the Inn failed? It would be jammed for the house-and-garden tours in April, but that wouldn&#x2019;t make up for empty rooms later in the summer. She paced up and down on the balcony, gingerly holding her jaw and trying not to whimper, and careful, too, to step quietly so as not to arouse any of the sleeping guests. Then, sharp and harsh as a peacock&#x2019;s cry, the gate to the grounds of the Historical Preservation Society squeaked open. Idell recognized the sound at once. She&#x2019;d known it for years, the sound of the gate that marked the boundary between her Inn and the Society grounds. But why would the gate be opening? And at this hour? She bent to peer over the railing. How curious! How strange! She would have to ask&#x2014;fiery hot pain lanced her jaw. She gave a soft moan and turned to go back inside.<br> &nbsp;<br> 3<br> &nbsp;<br> Corinne Prichard Webster stood in front of the ormolu-framed mirror. Despite the dusky, aged glass, her reflection glistened as brightly as crystal. She always enjoyed her morning encounter with her own image. Beauty was her handmaiden and had always been so. She felt confident that to men she represented the unattainable goal of perfection. Once, when she&#x2019;d asked Tim if he&#x2019;d like to paint her, he had been silent for a long time, then he&#x2019;d said, even if grudgingly, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re like the first streak of rose at sunrise.&#x201d; Tim was almost as poetic as he was artistic. It sickened her to realize that he&#x2019;d been beguiled by Sybil, who was no better than a slut for all the glory of her old name and her wealth. Well, they needn&#x2019;t think she would let Tim take his paintings from the museum. After all she&#x2019;d done for him, he must realize that it was his duty to stay in Chastain. Her mouth thinned with determination, then curved in a humorless smile. They thought it was settled, but he couldn&#x2019;t very well have a show in New York without any paintings&#x2014;and the paintings belonged to the Prichard Museum.<br> &nbsp;<br> She lifted a slender white hand to touch the tightness between her eyes, and the tiny wrinkles disappeared. She stared at her face appraisingly. Her eyes were still as vividly blue as always, her skin as smooth and soft as a young girl&#x2019;s. She felt a flash of satisfaction. She did so despise women who let themselves go. Lucy&#x2019;s face popped into her thoughts. Skin like leather from too many hours in her wretched garden and no more imagination in fashion than one might expect from a librarian. Boring, that was how Lucy dressed, although she could look quite nice when she chose. On Sundays, for example, she always wore a well-cut silk dress and a hat and gloves. Corinne shook her head. Hat and gloves. Almost no one wore them nowadays&#x2014;except Lucy. It certainly dated her. Corinne looked at her reflection in continuing satisfaction. No one could say that about her. She was always au courant, and no one thought she was as old as Lucy, either. It was certainly a good thing she&#x2019;d been firm years ago. It wouldn&#x2019;t have done for Cameron to marry Lucy and make her a Prichard, not a girl whose father ran a clothing store. The Prichards had never been small shop-keepers. The Prichards owned plantations and, long ago, sailing ships and warehouses.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her eyes narrowed, and she no longer looked at her reflection so she didn&#x2019;t see the transformation. At one instant, the mirrored face was soft and beguiling, almost as beautiful with its classic bones, silver-blonde hair, and Mediterranean blue eyes as on her wedding day at nineteen almost forty years before. Then, as Corinne Prichard Webster thought about her niece, Gail, and the manner in which she was behaving, throwing herself at a totally unsuitable man, the face hardened and looked all of its fifty-nine years, the eyes cold and hard, the mouth thin, determined, and cruel.<br> &nbsp;<br> The phone rang.<br> &nbsp;<br> Corinne didn&#x2019;t move to answer it, but she looked across her bedroom, past the silken canopied bed and the Queen Anne dresser to the compass rose desk which sat in an alcove, the blue velvet curtains unopened yet to the morning. The white and gold telephone, a French reproduction, rang again. Corinne waited, certain she knew the caller.<br> &nbsp;<br> A gentle knock sounded at her bedroom door, then Marybelle stepped inside.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The call is for you, ma&#x2019;am. Mr. Roscoe Merrill.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Corinne nodded. &#x201c;I will answer it, Marybelle.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As the maid softly closed the heavy door, Corinne moved to the telephone. Picking up the receiver, she lifted her chin. If Roscoe Merrill had been in the room, he would have recognized that stance. It was Corinne at her most imperious.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, Roscoe.&#x201d; She listened, then said impatiently, &#x201c;The private man reveals the public man.&#x201d; He spoke again, but Corinne was shaking her head. She interrupted sharply, &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t do any good for you to take that tone with me. I will do what I feel is right. You should have considered the consequences of your actions. I certainly feel that Jessica has every right to know.&#x201d; At his angry response, she depressed the cradle. Her face was implacable as she replaced the receiver.<br> &nbsp;<br> The green and pink porcelain clock on the mantel delicately chimed the quarter hour. Vexed, Corinne shook her head. She was running late this morning, and there was much she had to do. There was that matter of the clinic and John Sanford&#x2019;s foolish plan to expand it. That would draw more country people into Chastain, overburdening the hospital with the kind of people who couldn&#x2019;t pay. John must be made to see that he was out of line. Corinne yanked on the bell pull. She would have time for Marybelle to draw her bath, then she must hurry. So many things to attend to. That silly mystery program, for one. She felt a surge of irritation. Such a cheap idea. For once she agreed with Dora, but it had been obvious that the Board was going to approve Roscoe&#x2019;s stupid proposal. She&#x2019;d voted yes, even though she was seething inside. After all, she couldn&#x2019;t let it appear that the Board was taking such a major step without her approval. At least, as president, she&#x2019;d retained control of hiring the mystery expert. That was another reason to make Roscoe pay for his actions, which she certainly intended to do. There was a proper way to act and an improper way. That reminded her of Gail. She would talk to Gail without delay. Corinne sighed, overburdened. There were so many demands on her time and energy. Then she straightened and looked toward the dusky mirror, her face again soft and unlined. After all, she was Corinne Prichard Webster. People depended upon her, so many of them. What would they do without her?</p><h2>Murder By the Slice (Fresh-Baked Mystery)</h2><p>At this year&#39;s school carnival fund-raiser, the obnoxious president of the Parent Teacher Organization is found stabbed through the heart with Phyllis Newsom&#39;s own knife, with traces of incriminating frosting.

Rabbi Shapiro infuses this concept with new meaning as he describes a practical tenfold path, based on the eighteenth-century Hasidic tradition of the Baal Shem Tov and his followers, a path accessible not only to Jews but also to all spiritual seekers. <br><br>The ten practices of Minyan are meditation, repetition of a sacred phrase, inspirational reading, attention to the present moment, generosity, kindness performed with no thought of reward, dreamwork, ethical consumption, self-perfection, and celebration of the Sabbath. Here is a Jewish spiritual primer that teaches how to apply the wisdom of the ancient Jewish sages to our lives today.</p><p>Rabbi Rami Shapiro says that he went in search of Zen Judaism and found it in Hasidic literature. In writings that speak of the unity of self, God, and the world, he found a deeply spiritual tradition hidden within Judaism, for which many Jews have looked elsewhere. <p> From years of work in his own synagogue, Rabbi Shapiro developed 10 spiritual practices that help ground a person in divine reality and achieve balance in internal and external affairs. Perhaps you don't associate meditation or "ethical consumption" with the Torah, but Shapiro convincingly demonstrates their value to, and history within, Judaism. Eight other practices, such as attention, generosity, and kindness make up Shapiro's metaphorical Minyan. As the ties binding all things become more and more evident in this book, the necessity of persistent self-development also becomes clear. Shapiro places the self as a necessary link in a community, thereby providing us with the refuge of solitude along with the power and love of community. </p><p> Neither a conservative Hasidic nor a head-in-the-clouds mystic, Shapiro offers a detailed, tested way of Jewish spiritual growth and fulfillment.</p>My criterion for publishing most Bell Tower books is "Does this book change my spiritual practice?" and when Minyan arrived on my desk, it caused an enormous change in my life. I tend to work eight days a week but when I read the chapter on observing the sabbath, I was so moved by it, I stopped working for 25 hours each week. I come home on Friday evening and put all my manuscripts in one big pile on the table and don't touch them again until Saturday evening. That's hard for me because I am generally unable to rest until all the work is done (of course, this is an impossible situation), so I eye the pile from time to time but I let it rest also. I can't say that I'm actually celebrating the sabbath yet, but at least I'm not working. It's a beginning. And this is only one of the ten principles described in Rami's book.

The family narrative entrusted to her--"a well-polished artifact, an heirloom that had been carefully preserved"--began among the Yoruba in West Africa and continued with her own century and more of life.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1983, folklorist Jane Beck began a series of interviews with Turner, then one hundred years old and still relating four generations of oral history. Beck uses Turner's storytelling to build the Turner family saga, using at its foundation the oft-repeated touchstone stories at the heart of their experiences: the abduction into slavery of Turner's African ancestors; Daisy's father Alec Turner learning to read; his return as a soldier to his former plantation to kill his former overseer; and Daisy's childhood stand against racism. Other stories re-create enslavement and her father's life in Vermont--in short, the range of life events large and small, transmitted by means so alive as to include voice inflections. Beck, at the same time, weaves in historical research and offers a folklorist's perspective on oral history and the hazards--and uses--of memory.<br><br> Publication of this book is supported by grants from the Andrew W.

She continued her work with an NSF postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at UNM followed by a Burroh&#39;s Wellcome Fund Postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Keller has written for the Christian home school market for over eight years and, having been in an academic setting for most of her adult career, Dr. Keller understands the issues faced by both religious and secular parents. The Real Science-4-Kids books are Dr. Keller&#39;s answer to the difficult territory teachers and parents navigate as they try to sort through the various philosophical perspectives found in science. Real Science-4-Kids is written as a &#34;worldview-neutral&#34; curriculum that Dr. Keller hopes will not only provide students with a solid foundation for science, but also give them the tools to evaluate scientific data on their own. Dr. Keller does not believe we should rely on the &#34;experts&#34; but instead learn how to critically evaluate every scientific claim.</p><h2>Smuggler&#39;s Moon (Sir John Fielding)</h2><p>Blind magistrate Sir John Fielding investigates corruption and murder in the seaside town of Deal, which has become a haven for smugglers.</p><p>Bruce Alexander is the pseudonym for a well-known author of fiction and non-fiction. The previous books in this series are <b>Blind Justice, Murder in Grub Street </b>(Named by <b>The New York Times Book Review</b> as a Notable Book in 1995), <b>Watery Grave, Person or Persons Unknown</b> (named by the <b>Chicago Tribune</b> as one of the best novels of 1997), <b>Jack, Knave and Fool</b>, and <b>Death of a Colonial</b>.Sir John Fielding, the blind magistrate of Bow Street Court, returns for another rousing period crime adventure, as told by 17-year-old orphan Jeremy Proctor, from the pseudonymous Alexander (Blind Justice; Watery Grave; etc.). In 1772, Jeremy is learning the law from Sir John, for whom he is companion and attendant, but he has little time for study when the Lord Chief Justice sends Sir John to the town of Deal in Kent to investigate the conduct of the magistrate there. Fifteen-year-old Clarissa Roundtree, another stray welcomed into the Fielding household as Lady Fielding's assistant, accompanies them to Kent. Lying a short distance from the French coast, Deal prospers from "owling," the local term for smuggling. Soon after their arrival, the local magistrate is murdered, while smugglers boldly continue their activities. Sir John, as acting magistrate, plans an ingenious land-and-sea trap to ensnare the smuggling gang and sever their supply and distribution lines. At the swashbuckling climax, under the bright light of a "smuggler's moon," Jeremy proves himself a hero as part of the boarding party engaging in an on-deck saber fight with the villains. As for Clarissa, who once aspired to write romance novels, she conceives of the first murder mystery in the wake of the action. As usual, the author deftly captures the flavor of the period without overdoing the archaic language. This is an exciting novel sure to please established fans and those who appreciate classic yarns in the tradition of Treasure Island. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Astronaut: 1961 onwards (all roles and nationalities) (Owners&#39; Workshop Manual)</h2><p><p>The book begins with early ideas about astronauts in science fiction and film portrayals of the role. It goes on to cover recruitment and the application process to become an astronaut with NASA and ESA, and the qualifications and fitness required for various astronaut roles. The reader is taken through training for different types of astronaut roles (pilot, scientist, payload specialist, space walker, Moon walker, etc) and the different types of missions are described (sub-orbital, Earth orbit, living aboard the International Space Station (ISS), lunar flight and landing, driving on the Moon, and planned future missions to asteroids and Mars). The equipment used by astronauts is documented, including clothing, space suits, tools, backpacks, zero-gravity toilets, food stations, etc. The experience of space flight on typical missions is outlined, illustrated by the accounts of real astronauts on actual flights &#x2013; the experience of launch, first reactions to Zero-G, exiting the hatch for a spacewalk, the views of Earth, walking on the Moon, and re-entering the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere.<br><br> The book is written in a style accessible to the layperson, while including sufficient technical details to satisfy more knowledgeable readers. It also captures the excitement and wonder of spaceflight, making extensive use of astronaut biographies and interviews to uncover the real human experience, as much as technical information to provide detail to satisfy those curious about &#x2018;how it works&#x2019;.<br> &nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Dr Ken MacTaggart</b> is Co-Editor (with David Woods) of the Apollo 11 Flight Journal, NASA's official record of the mission, with accompanying technical commentary.

She has received dozens of awards and accolades, including starred reviews from Publishers Weekly, Library Journal, The New York Journal of Books and Kirkus.&nbsp;<br><br>Kristan lives in Connecticut with her heroic firefighter husband, two atypically affectionate children, a neurotic rescue mutt and an occasionally friendly cat.&nbsp;<br><br>For a guy who taught mechanical engineering at a fourth-rate college in the middle of nowhere, Tom Barlow was packing them in.<br><br>At the university where he'd last taught, there'd been an actual engineering school, and his students were genuinely interested in the subject matter. Here, though, at tiny Wickham College, four of the original six attendees had stumbled into class, having left registration until too late, only taking mechanical engineering because it still had open slots. Two had seemed genuinely interested, until one, the girl, transferred to Carnegie Mellon.<br><br>But then, by the end of the second week, he suddenly had thirty-six students jammed into the little classroom. Each one of these new students was female, ranging in age from eighteen to possibly fifty-five. Suddenly, an astonishing array of girls and women had decided that mechanical engineering (whatever that was) had become their new passion in life.<br><br>The clothes were a bit of a problem. Tight, trashy, low-cut, low-riding, inappropriate. Tom tended to teach to the wall in the back of the room, not wanting to make eye contact with the hungry gazes of seventy-eight percent of his class.<br><br>He tried not to leave time for questions, as the Barbarian Horde, as he thought of them, tended to be inappropriate. <em>Are you single? How old are you? Where 'd you come from? Do you like foreign films/sushi/girls?</em><br><br>Then again, he needed this job. "Any questions?" he asked. Dozens of hands shot up. "Yes, Mr. Kearns," he said gratefully to the one student in the class who was there out of interest in the subject.<br><br>According to his file, Jacob Kearns had been kicked out of MIT for doing drugs. He seemed on the straight and narrow now, at least, but Wickham College was a hundred steps down academically. Then again, Tom knew all about shooting himself in the foot, career-wise.<br><br>"Dr. Barlow, with the hovercraft project, I was wondering how you'd calculate the escape velocity?"<br><br>"Good question. The escape velocity is the speed at which the kinetic energy of your object, along with its gravitational potential energy, is zero. Make sense?" The Barbarian Horde (those who were listening) looked confused.<br><br>"Definitely," Jacob said. "Thanks."<br><br>Thirty seconds to the bell. "Listen up," he said. "Your homework is to read chapters six and seven in your texts and answer all the study questions at the end of both as well as pass in your term project proposals. Those of you who flunked the hovercraft estimates have to do them again." Hopefully, he could break the Horde with a ridiculous workload. "Anything else?"<br><br>A hand went up. One of the Barbarians, of course. "Yes?" he said briskly.<br><br>"Are you British?" she asked, getting a ripple of giggles from a third of the class, whose mental age appeared to be twelve.<br><br>"I've answered that in a previous class. Any other questions that pertain to mechanical engineering, then? No? Great. Cheerio."<br><br>"Oh, my God, he said 'Cheerio,'" said a blonde dressed like a Cockney prostitute.<br><br>The bell rang, and the Barbarian Horde surged toward his desk. "Mr. Kearns, please stay a minute," Tom said.<br><br>Seven female students clustered around him. "So do you think I could, like, work for an architect or something?" one asked.<br><br>"I've no idea," he answered.<br><br>"I mean, after this class." She lowered her gaze to his mouth. Crikey. Made him want to shower.<br><br>"Pass the class first, then apply and see," he said.<br><br>"Do you want to hang out at the pub, Tom?" asked another of the BH. "I'd love to buy you a drink."<br><br>"That'd be inappropriate," he answered.<br><br>"I'm totally legal," she said with a leer.<br><br>"If you don't have any questions related to the lesson today, get out, please." He smiled to soften the words, and with a lot of pouty lips and hair tossing, the Barbarian Horde departed.<br><br>Tom waited till the other kids were out of earshot. "Jacob, would you be interested in interning for me?"<br><br>"Yeah! Sure! Um, doing what?"<br><br>"I customize airplanes here and there. Got a project coming up. It might be good on your CV."<br><br>"What's a CV?"<br><br>"A resume."<br><br>"Sure!" Jacob said again. "That'd be great."<br><br>"You can't be using, of course. Will that be a problem?"<br><br>The kid flushed. "No. I'm in NA and all that. Clean for thirteen months." He pushed his hands into his pockets. "I have to pee in a cup every month to come here. The health office has my records."<br><br>"Good. I'll give you a shout when I need you."<br><br>"Thanks, Dr. Barlow. Thanks a lot."<br><br>Tom nodded. The head of his department was standing in the doorway, frowning down the hallway, where a cacophony of giggles was coming from the twits. When Jacob left, the man came in and closed the door behind him.<br><br>This wouldn't be good news, Tom thought. Droog Dragul (not a shock that he was called Dracula, was it?) had the face of a medieval monk&#x2014;tortured, pale and severe. He looked even more depressed than usual.<br><br>"Dee cheeldren of dis school," Droog said in his thick accent. He sighed. "Dey are so..." Tom winced, fearing the next phrase would be <em>well fed</em> or <em>iron-rich.</em> "Dey are so unfocused." Phew.<br><br>"Most of them, anyway," Tom said. "I've got one or two good students."<br><br>"Yes." His boss sighed. "And you heff such a vay vith the ladies, Tom. Perhaps we can heff beer and you can give pointers."<br><br>"It's the accent, mate," Tom said.<br><br>"Mine does not seem to heff same effect, for some reason. Eh heh heh heh heh!"<br><br>Tom winced, then smiled. Droog was a good guy. Strange, but nice enough. In the month since Tom had been teaching here, they'd had dinner once, gone out for beer and pool twice, and if the experience had been odd, it seemed that Droog had a good heart.<br><br>His boss sighed and sat down, tapping his long fingers on the desk. "Tom, I am afraid I heff bad news. Vee von't be able to renew your vork visa."<br><br>Tom inhaled sharply. The only reason he'd taken this job was for the work visa. "That was a condition of my employment."<br><br>"I em aware. But dee budget...it is too overtaxed for dee court fees."<br><br>"I thought you said it'd be no problem."<br><br>"I vas wrong. They heff reconsidered."<br><br>Tom felt his jaw locking. "I see."<br><br>"Vee value your teaching abilities and experience, Tom. Perhaps you vill find another way. Vee can give you till end of semester." He paused. "I em sorry. Very much so."<br><br>Tom nodded. "Thanks, mate." It wasn't Droog's fault. But shit.<br><br>Dr. Dragul left, and Tom sat at his desk another few minutes. Finding another job in February was unlikely. Wickham College had been the only place in western New York looking for an engineering professor, and Tom had been lucky to get the job as fast as he did. It wasn't a prestigious place, not by a long shot, but that wasn't really the point. This time around, it was all about location.<br><br>He couldn't keep his job without a work visa, though it wasn't like Immigration would be breathing down his neck; an employed professor was less of a concern than most of their cases. Still, the college wasn't going to keep him on illegally.<br><br>If he was going to stay, he needed a green card.<br><br>Fast.<br><br>But first to the rather shabby house he'd just rented, and then to the much better bar down the street. A drink was definitely required.<br><br>A few nights later, Tom sat in the kitchen of his great-aunt Candace's kitchen, drinking tea. Only Brits could make decent tea, and though Candace had lived in the States for at least six decades, she hadn't lost the touch.<br><br>"That Melissa," Aunt Candace said darkly. "She messed everything up, didn't she?"<br><br>"Well. Let's not speak ill of the dead."<br><br>"But I'll miss you! And what about Charlie? How old is he now? Twelve?"<br><br>"Fourteen." His unofficial stepson had been ten when Tom met him. Hard to reconcile that talkative, happy little boy with the sullen teenager who barely spoke these days.<br><br>A fleeting pain lanced through his chest. Charlie wouldn't miss him, that seemed certain. One of those situations where Tom wasn't sure if he was doing any good whatsoever, or if, in fact, his presence made things worse. Melissa, Charlie's mother, was dead, and her brief engagement to Tom qualified him as nothing in the boy's life today, even though Charlie had been just a few months away from becoming Tom's stepson.<br><br>Whatever the case, Tom didn't have much choice about whether or not he was staying in the States. He'd emailed his old department head in England, who wrote right back saying they'd take Tom back in a heartbeat. There weren't any other colleges in western New York looking for someone with his credentials. And teaching was what he loved (when the students were actually interested in the subject matter, that was).<br><br>And so, Tom had decided to drive to Pennsylvania, visit the only relative he had in this country and start the goodbye process. He'd been in the States for four years now, and Aunt Candace had been good to him. Not to mention delirious with joy when he called after his last class to see if she was free for dinner. He even took her to the mall so she could buy a coat, proving a fact Tom firmly believed&#x2014;he was a bloody saint.<br><br>"Here. Have more pie, darling." She pushed the dish across the table toward him, and Tom helped himself.<br><br>"Thanks," he said.<br><br>"Lovely town, Manningsport," she said. "I lived near there as a child, did you know that?"<br><br>"So you told me," Tom said. His lovely old aunt could bake, that was certain.<br><br>"Finish that pie, you might as well. I'm prediabetic or some such nonsense. Then again, I'm also eighty-two years old. Life without dessert is too horrible to contemplate. I'll just overdose on caramel corn and die with a smile on my face. What was I saying again?"<br><br>"You used to live near Manningsport."<br><br>"Yes, that's right! Just for a few years. My mother was a widow, you see. My father died of pneumonia, and so she packed my brother and me up and came to America. Elsbeth, your grandmother, was already married, so she stayed in Manchester with her husband, of course. Your grandfather. But I remember the crossing, seeing the Statue of Liberty. I was seven years old. Oh, it was thrilling!" She smiled and took a sip of tea.<br><br>"So that's how you became a Yank?" Tom asked.<br><br>She nodded. "We lived in Corning, and she met my stepfather, and he adopted Peter and me."<br><br>"I never knew that," Tom said.<br><br>"He was a lovely man. A farmer. Sometimes I'd go with him to deliver milk." Candace smiled. "Anyway, we moved after my brother died in the war. I was fifteen then. But I still have a friend there. More of a pen pal, do you know what that is?" Tom smiled. "I do."<br><br>"A pity you have to leave. It's beautiful there." Candy's gaze suddenly sharpened. "Tom, dear...if you really want to stay in the States, you can always marry an American."<br><br>"That's illegal, Auntie."<br><br>"Oh, pooh."<br><br>He laughed. "I can't see myself going that far," he said. "It might be different if&#x2014;well. It's not an option."<br><br>It might be if Charlie actually wanted him to stay. Needed him. If Tom were anything but a thorn in Charlie's side, he might give it a whirl.<br><br>He had two thin job prospects with manufacturing firms, both requiring experience he didn't have. If those didn't work out (and he was almost positive they wouldn't), he'd be heading back to jolly old England, which wouldn't be awful. He'd be near his dad. Probably meet some nice girl someday. Charlie would barely remember him.<br><br>The pie suddenly tasted like ash. He pushed back his plate. "I'd better be off," he said. "Thanks for the visit."<br><br>She stood up and hugged him, her cheek soft against his. "Thank you for coming to see an old lady," she said. "I'm going to brag about this for days. My grand-nephew adores me."<br><br>"You're right. Ta, Auntie. I'll call you and let you know what's happening."<br><br>"If I happen to know someone who might be interested, can I give her your number, dear?"<br><br>"Interested in what, Auntie?"<br><br>"In marrying you."<br><br>Tom laughed. The old lady's face was so hopeful, though. "Sure," he said, giving her another kiss on the cheek. Let the old bird feel useful, and that way, maybe she wouldn't feel so bad when he went back to England.<br><br>There was that pain in his chest again.<br><br>It took four hours to drive back to Manningsport. Four hours of wretched, icy rain and windshield wipers that smeared, rather than cleared. The weather thickened as he approached the Finger Lakes. Perhaps he wouldn't get in too late to grab a bite (and a whiskey) at the pub he was becoming too fond of. Chat up the pretty bartender and try not to think about the future.<br><br></p><h2>Black Elk&#39;s Vision: A Lakota Story</h2><p>Told from the Native American point of view, <i>Black Elk&#x2019;s Vision</i> provides a unique perspective on American history. &nbsp; From recounting the visions Black Elk had as a young boy, to his involvement in the battles of Little Big Horn and Wounded Knee, as well as his journeys to New York City and Europe with Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s Wild West Show, this biographical account of Black Elk&#x2014;an Oglala-Lakota medicine man (1863&#x2013;1950)&#x2014;follows him from childhood through adulthood. &nbsp; S. D. Nelson tells the story of Black Elk through the medicine man&#x2019;s voice, bringing to life what it was like to be Native American in the mid-to-late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. The Native people found their land overrun by the Wha-shi-choos, or White Man, the buffalo slaughtered for sport and to purposely eliminate their main food source, and their people gathered onto reservations. Through it all, Black Elk clung to his childhood visions that planted the seeds to help his people&#x2014;and all people&#x2014;understand their place in the circle of life. &nbsp; The book includes archival images, a timeline, a bibliography, an index, and Nelson&#x2019;s signature art.<br> &nbsp; Praise for the work of S.

Grade 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Born in 1863, Black Elk, an Oglala-Lakota medicine man, was warned from an early age to beware the "Wha-shi-choo," or white people, and for good reason. By the time he was 16, his people had been attacked on their lands, fought at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, and been confined to grim reservations, their way of life forever changed. Told in a first-person narrative, this handsome biography is adorned with vibrant acrylic paintings that depict the mystical images (spirit voices and visions) that Black Elk first experienced as a child. A fever vision at age nine, in which he met with the six grandfathers, the ancestral beings, proved to be a pivotal experience for him. As a teenager, he ultimately led a Horse Dance ceremony in which he brought a message of hope and instruction to his people. In addition to his respected tribal status, his involvement in many landmark events, from his travels with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show to being injured at the Wounded Knee massacre, makes him a unique historical figure. Aptly chosen photographs (some of which are graphic images of buffalo carcasses and a scene of a mass grave at Wounded Knee) provide accurate historical perspective. An author's note on understanding his Great Vision and background information on the book are included. This is an important contribution to Native biography.&#x2014;<i>Madeline J.

Weisbach present arguments for and against the relevance of ethics to global climate policy. Gardiner argues that climate change is fundamentally an ethical issue, since it is an early instance of a distinctive challenge to ethical action (the perfect moral storm), and ethical concerns (such as with justice, rights, political legitimacy, community and humanity's relationship to nature) are at the heart of many of the decisions that need to be made. Consequently, climate policy that ignores ethics is at risk of "solving" the wrong problem, perhaps even to the extreme of endorsing forms of climate extortion. This is especially true of policy based on narrow forms of economic self-interest. By contrast, Weisbach argues that existing ethical theories are not well suited to addressing climate change. As applied to climate change, existing ethical theories suffer from internal logical problems and suggest infeasible strategies. Rather than following failed theories or waiting indefinitely for new and better ones, Weisbach argues that central motivation for climate policy is straightforward: it is in their common interest for people and nations to agree to policies that dramatically reduce emissions to prevent terrible harms.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen M. Gardiner</strong> is Professor of Philosophy and Ben Rabinowitz Endowed Professor of the Human Dimensions of the Environment at the University of Washington, Seattle. He is the author of A Perfect Moral Storm (Oxford, 2011), editor of Virtue Ethics, Old and New (Cornell, 2005), and co-editor of the Oxford Handbook of Environmental Ethics (Oxford, in press) and Climate Ethics: Essential Readings (Oxford, 2010). His research focuses on global environmental problems, future generations and virtue ethics.<br><br><strong>David A. Weisbach</strong> is the Walter J Blum Professor at the University of Chicago Law School and Senior Fellow at the University of Chicago Computation Institute and Argonne National Laboratories. Weisbach's research primarily focuses on issues related to taxation and on policy aspects of climate change. <br> <br>Weisbach received his BS in Mathematics from the University of Michigan in 1985; a Masters in Advance Study (Mathematics) from Wolfson College, Cambridge in 1986; and a JD from Harvard Law School in 1989. After graduating from law school, Weisbach clerked for Judge Joel M. Flaum of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and worked as an associate in the law firm of Miller &amp; Chevalier. In 1992, Weisbach joined the Department of Treasury where he worked as an attorney-advisor in the Office of the Tax Legislative Counsel and, subsequently, as associate tax legislative counsel. In 1996, Weisbach was appointed Associate Professor of Law at Georgetown Law Center and joined the Chicago faculty in 1998.<br><br>"One of the most refreshing aspects of Gardiner and Weisbach's contribution to this debate is that both of them--Gardiner a philosopher, Weisbach an economist--think that rapid decarbonization must be the paramount aim of climate policy...this is an extremely valuable book and I recommend it warmly. Both authors display an admirable tenacity, courage, forbearance, and intelligence. Their debate marks a significant advance in our attempts to grapple with this most serious of issues." -- <em>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Frankenstein: Or the Modern Prometheus - The 1818 Text</h2><p><p>"James Rieger's <i>Frankenstein</i> is relatively special among editions: it is the definitive scholarly text, and it is also the most readable copy for the classroom and the general reader. . . .The Rieger <i>Frankenstein</i> is very simply the best edition of this tremendously important and popular novel."&#x2014;William Veeder, University of Chicago</p></p><p><i>Frankenstein,</i> loved by many decades of readers and praised by such eminent literary critics as Harold Bloom, seems hardly to need a recommendation. If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

A land of astonishing natural beauty and a dizzying array of ancient cultures, the Caucasus for most of the twentieth century lay inside the Soviet Union, before movements of national liberation created newly independent countries and sparked the devastating war in Chechnya.<br><br>Combining riveting storytelling with insightful analysis, <em>The Ghost of Freedom</em> is the first general history of the modern Caucasus, stretching from the beginning of Russian imperial expansion up to the rise of new countries after the Soviet Union's collapse. In evocative and accessible prose, Charles King reveals how tsars, highlanders, revolutionaries, and adventurers have contributed to the fascinating history of this borderland, providing an indispensable guide to the complicated histories, politics, and cultures of this intriguing frontier. Based on new research in multiple languages, the book shows how the struggle for freedom in the mountains, hills, and plains of the Caucasus has been a perennial theme over the last two hundred years--a struggle which has led to liberation as well as to new forms of captivity. The book sheds valuable light on the origins of modern disputes, including the ongoing war in Chechnya, conflicts in Georgia and Azerbaijan, and debates over oil from the Caspian Sea and its impact on world markets.<br><br>Ranging from the salons of Russian writers to the circus sideshows of America, from the offices of European diplomats to the villages of Muslim mountaineers, <em>The Ghost of Freedom</em> paints a rich portrait of one of the world's most turbulent and least understood regions.<br></p><p><br><strong>Charles King</strong> is Ion Ratiu Professor of Romanian Studies, Professor of International Affairs, and Professor of Government at Georgetown University. He is the author of <em>The Black Sea: A History</em> and <em>The Moldovans</em>, and his writing has appeared in <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> and <em>Foreign Affairs</em>.<br><br>"In this first general history of the modern Caucasus to appear in the West...King sheds light on modern tribulations and disputes, including the ongoing war in Chechnya, the Georgian-South Ossetian and Georgian-Abkhazian conflics."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"It is a bold historian who writes a history of the Caucasus....Some forty mutually unintelligible languages are spoken. Worse for anyone trying to present a coherent narrative, these disparate peoples have very different histories, and only two, the Georgians and Armenians (some would add the Azeris), have a history of statehood consistent enough to be retold as one would retell the history of a West European coutnry."--Donald Rayfield, <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"King picks and chooses events and themes seemingly designed to give proper depth to an understanding of the fiery, violent decade and a half since the collapse of the Soviet Union."--<em>Foreign Affairs</em><p></p><br>"Recently, a few books have been published about the Caucasus...but King's is the most comprehensive, weaving in the history of all the events from the past two centuries that shaped czarist, Soviet, and Russian relations with the region."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Charles King has produced a work that is at once informative, eclectic, and immensely satisfying."--Alex van Oss, Eurasianet.org<p></p><br>"Charles King's <em>Ghost of Freedom</em> is a work that's gripping and important, scholarly and wonderfully readable. It not only explains and analyzes one of our world's most strategic regions but also delivers all the exotic and romantic turbulence of these flamboyant warriors and poets and the extraordinary peoples of the Caucasus."--Simon Sebag Montefiore, author of <em>Young Stalin</em><p></p><br>"In a single volume, King manages to pull off the seemingly impossible task of presenting a portrait of the region as a whole, and one that is wonderfully written as it simultaneously informs, entertains, challenges, and stimulates."--<em>Middle East Strategy at Harvard</em><p></p><br>"This vividly written and impressively researched history is an excellent introduction to a much discussed but little understood region."--Anatol Lieven, King's College London<p></p><br>"<em>The Ghost of Freedom</em> is a brilliant tour through the past and present of a critical borderland between East and West. Enlivened by compelling anecdotes, colorful characters, and first-hand reportage that bring the Caucasus to life, this remarkable book is a highly original and beautifully written analysis of the forces that have shaped the region, from a whirlwind of imperial conquest and nation-building to Soviet engineering, mass deportations, and the bitter consequences of imperial collapse: ethnic wars, banditry, refugees, and misrule. It is an indispensable guide to the Caucasus--and to contemporary global affairs."--Robert D. Crews, author of <em>For Prophet and Tsar: Islam and Empire in Russia and Central Asia</em><p></p><br>"This is a rare work with something for all readers...King's ability to tease out the broader historical patterns in all their complexities and subtleties is remarkable. At the same time, he possesses the sort of keen eye for detail and telling stories that bring the region truly to life in all its vibrant color."--<em>Europe: Early Modern and Modern</em><p></p><br>"King has produced a work that is remarkable for its breadth of coverage, the depth of the author's insights, and the eloquence of the text. It is hard to imagine how the goal King set himself could have been better achieved."--<em>Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Secularization of the European Mind in the Nineteenth Century (Canto original series)</h2><p>The declining hold of the Church and its doctrines on European society represents a major shift in Western life and thought. Owen Chadwick&#39;s acclaimed lectures on the secularisation of the European mind trace this movement in the nineteenth century, identifying and exploring both the social and the intellectual aspects of this momentous change. The rise of technology, the growth of big cities and a cheap press take their place alongside evolutionary science and Marxism in this fascinating analysis of the erosion of the Church&#39;s power. Woven into its brilliant discussion are brief but very illuminating studies of familiar major thinkers, including Marx, Darwin, Mill and Comte.</p><p>The roles of the rise of technology, the growth of big cities and a cheap press, as well as the philosophies of evolutionary science and Marxism, are explored in an acclaimed analysis of the nineteenth century erosion of the Church&#39;s power.&#34;We are provided not only with food but with a feast for thought.&#34; Otto Scott&#39;s Compass</p><h2>Oracle 12c: SQL</h2><p>Now you can master the latest version of the fundamental SQL language used in all relational databases today with ORACLE 12C: SQL, 3E.

Cross dressing, gender impersonation, and long-term masquerades of the opposite sex are commonplace throughout history. </p><p>In contemporary American culture, the behavior occurs most often among male heterosexuals and homosexuals, sometimes for erotic pleasure, sometimes not. In the past, however, cross dressing was for the most part practiced more often by women than men. Although males often burlesqued women and gave comic impersonations of them, they rarely attempted a change of public gender until the twentieth century. This phenomenon, according to Vern L. Bullough and Bonnie Bullough, has implications for any understanding of the changing relationships between the sexes in the twentieth century.</p><p>In most Western societies, being a man and demonstrating masculinity is more highly prized than being a woman and displaying femininity. Some non-Western societies, however, are more tolerant and even encourage men to behave like women and women to act like men. <i>Cross Dressing, Sex, and Gender</i> not only surveys cross dressing and gender impersonation throughout history and in a variety of cultures but also examines the medical, biological, psychological, and sociological findings that have been presented in the modern scientific literature. This volume offers the results of the authors' research into contemporary gender issues and the search for explanations. After examining the various current theories regarding cross dressing and gender impersonation, the Bulloughs offer their own theory.</p><p>This book, widely deemed a classic in its field, is the culmination of thirty years of research by the Bulloughs into gender impersonation and cross dressing. Their groundbreaking findings will be of interest to anyone involved in the debate over nature versus nurture, and have implications not only for scholars in the various social sciences and sex and gender studies, but for educators, nurses, physicians, feminists, gays, lesbians, and general readers. This work will be of more personal interest to anyone who identifies as a transvestite or transsexual or who has been classified by medical and psychiatric professionals as suffering from gender dysphoria.</p><p><i>Cross Dressing, Sex, and Gender</i> covers a wide range of cultures and periods. As the first comprehensive attempt to examine the phenomenon of cross dressing, it will be of interest to students and scholars of social history, sociology, nursing, and women's studies.</p></p><p>Vern L. Bullough is SUNY Distinguished Professor in History and Social Studies at the State University of New York and in the School of Nursing at the State University of New York. Bonnie Bullough is Professor in the School of Nursing at the State University of New York. The Bulloughs have coauthored a number of books on various aspects of sex and gender, including Contraception: A Guide to Birth Control Methods and Women and Prostitution. Both have also written extensively, sometimes together and other times individually, on the issues of sex and gender, health care, and the history of science, medicine, and nursing.<p>"With so much media interest . . . the publication of this book is timely. . . .

An excellent addition to our understanding of these phenomena and a worthwhile resource for scholars, clinicians, and educators interested in sexuality and gender. The book should also prove very helpful to those struggling to understand these urges and behavior in themselves or in someone close to them."&#x2014;<i>Journal of Sex Education and Therapy</i></p><br><br><p>"For all scholars of psychology and sexuality, as well as the literate general public, historian Vern Bullough and nurse Bonnie Bullough have done an invaluable service in providing an overview of the phenomenon of cross-dressing. . . .

Chapter IV develops the close relationships between special relativity and electromagnetic theory, while Chapter V explores less familiar consequences of the theory, including the effect of relativity in providing a natural starting-point for the energy content of thermodynamic systems.Chapter VI considers the general theory of relativity together with some of its more elementary applications. Included are the principle of covariance, the principle of equivalence, and the hypothesis of Mach, along with other topics. Chapter VII, on relativistic mechanics, is divided into two parts &#x2014; general mechanical principles and solutions of the field equations. Chapter VIII discusses relativistic electrodynamics, presenting further extensions to general relativity both for the Lorentz electron theory and for the Minkowski macroscopic theory.Chapter IX deals with relativistic thermodynamics and considers the extension of thermodynamics from special to general relativity, together with its applications. Finally, in Chapter X, the author takes up the application of relativistic mechanics and relativistic thermodynamics to cosmological models.<br>Among the important features of this study, which set it apart from older texts on relativity, are the extensions of thermodynamics to general relativity, the material on non-static models of the universe, and the treatment of gravitational interaction of light rays and particles.Throughout, stress is on the physical nature of assumptions and conclusions and the physical significance of their interconnection, rather than mathematical generality or rigor. Several helpful appendices complete the book, including formulae for vector and tensor analysis, useful constants, and symbols for quantities.</p><p></p><h2>THINK Social Psychology, 2012 Edition</h2><p><p> <i>For an undergraduate introductory level course in social psychology.</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>THINK Currency</b> </p> <p> <b>THINK Relevancy</b> </p> <p> <b> <i>THINK Social Psychology</i> </b> </p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <p> <i>THINK Social Psychology</i> covers the essentials every social psychology student should know.

Activists, filmmakers, writers, and artists are seeking to bring the crisis to the public&#x2019;s attention through stories and images that use the strategies of elegy, tragedy, epic, and even comedy. <i>Imagining Extinction</i> is the first book to examine the cultural frameworks shaping these narratives and images.<br><br> Ursula K. Heise argues that understanding these stories and symbols is indispensable for any effective advocacy on behalf of endangered species. More than that, she shows how biodiversity conservation, even and especially in its scientific and legal dimensions, is shaped by cultural assumptions about what is valuable in nature and what is not. These assumptions are hardwired into even seemingly neutral tools such as biodiversity databases and laws for the protection of endangered species. Heise shows that the conflicts and convergences of biodiversity conservation with animal welfare advocacy, environmental justice, and discussions about the Anthropocene open up a new vision of multispecies justice. Ultimately,<i> Imagining Extinction</i> demonstrates that biodiversity, endangered species, and extinction are not only scientific questions but issues of histories, cultures, and values.</p><p><b>Ursula K. Heise</b>&nbsp;is the Marcia H. Howard Chair in Literary Studies in the Department of English and the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles.&nbsp;Her books include <i>Chronoschisms: Time, Narrative, and Postmodernism</i> and <i>Sense of Place and Sense of Planet: The Environmental Imagination of the Global</i>.&#x201c;[An] important, scholarly book. . . . Recommended.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Heise is the leading ecocritic of her generation. Any serious-minded person with a concern for the longstanding but accelerating plight of endangered nonhuman species&#x2014;and how to make sense of its history and possible futures as an urgent cultural predicament&#x2014;is certain to profit from reading <i>Imagining Extinction</i>.&#x201d; (Lawrence Buell, Harvard University)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Imagining Extinction</i> shows Heise working at the height of her powers, traversing a formidable range of charged ecological-cultural issues that include mass species extinctions and rapid loss of biodiversity; global climate change; narrative &#x2018;templates&#x2019; that structure how cultures care about, and tell stories about, other species; the rise of biodiversity databases; biodiversity laws; and animal rights. This book is elegantly written, cogently organized, and comprehensively researched.&#x201d; (Nicole Shukin, University of Victoria)<br><br>&#x201c;Timely and nuanced.&#x201d; (<i>ECOhUMANITIES</i>)<br><br>"Ursula Heise, who takes the time to unravel the philosophical contradictions that riddle the field with landmines. She&#x2019;s very good at asking difficult questions. . . . Her book breaks interesting ground, examining the role of archives and databases as cultural mechanisms for establishing meaning as important as science fiction, ethnography, and theories of justice. All of these are woven together in the book, producing some refreshing new ways of thinking about our predicament."<br> &nbsp; (<i>Nowtopian</i>)<br><br>"A nuanced re-visioning of extinction discourse, inflected powerfully by literary traditions ranging from&nbsp;elegy to&nbsp;epic.&nbsp;. . . Bound by temporal division, suggests Heise, only the human imagination can seemingly inspire the kind of social and political action championed by environmentalists and scientists alike. . . . &nbsp;<i>Imagining Extinction</i>&nbsp;persuasively advocates for the centrality of the literary, the anthropological, the historical, and the psychological in coding and recoding our present considerations of extinction and the Anthropocene. Repeatedly, Heise draws our attention to 'the stories we tell about ourselves.' Perhaps this, after all, is the humanities&#x2019; calling. Writing and rewriting stories about who we are, where we are, why we are. And yet, in the same way that I do not want the humanities reduced to a single function, I would also not want to reduce Heise&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Imagining Extinction</i>&nbsp;to a single application. Self-consciously, the text seems crafted in order to lend itself to alliances far beyond a single discourse or discipline. Extinction, after all, is by its present definition uncontained and uncontainable."<br> &nbsp; (Clint Wilson III <i>Cultures of Energy</i>)<br><br>"As a framework, multispecies justice attends to the ways in which cultural, socio-political, economic, and historical differences have shaped our thinking about human and non-human communities, as well as our relations to biological and ecological differences. The hope&#x2013;as Heise&#x2019;s work indicates--is that it may serve as a starting point for telling different stories and imagining a better future." (<i>Tranimacies</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This ambitious study covers extensive intellectual ground. The author&#x2019;s goal is not to understand what endangered species and extinction mean biologically but to move toward understanding what they do (and perhaps to learn what they could eventually come to) mean culturally&#x2014;or, in her words, &#x2018;how they mean culturally.&#x2019; That distinction does not and should not be taken as an indication that this book does not represent relevant reading for biologists. It does, although it is equally relevant for anyone concerned about biodiversity and the environment.&#x201d; (<i>The Quarterly Review of Biology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The range of Heise&#x2019;s analyses and the care with which she maintains her critical distance are remarkably impressive. . . . <i>Imagining Extinction</i> is a crisp, consistently intelligent study which helps us to think through extinction and the loss of biodiversity, but also how to negotiate and respect cultural difference, and how, practically, to extend that consideration to other living beings.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>The British Society for Literature and Science</i>)<br><br>"In <i>Imagining Extinction</i>, Heise reads for&nbsp;extinction story templates across last-of-its-kind narratives, biodiversity databases, endangered species laws, and contemporary speculative fiction, along with other genres and media....Heise deftly lays pathways that environmental humanities scholars will tread for the foreseeable future. Her questions assume the primacy of narrative, but they also push literary and cultural scholars to deploy their skills of apprehension, discernment, analysis, and articulation across a wide range of disciplinary boundaries. They also offer incredibly useful anchors for teaching, in particular for helping students think about intersectional structures of oppression that encompass human and nonhuman creatures and their habitats."

This new volume, an extensive revision and abridgment of <i>The Art of Persuasion in Greece</i>, <i>The Art of Rhetoric in the Roman World,</i> and <i>Greek Rhetoric under Christian Emperors,</i> provides a comprehensive history of classical rhetoric, one that is sure to become a standard for its time.</p><br><p> Kennedy begins by identifying the rhetorical features of early Greek literature that anticipated the formulation of "metarhetoric," or a theory of rhetoric, in the fifth and fourth centuries b.c.e. and then traces the development of that theory through the Greco-Roman period. He gives an account of the teaching of literary and oral composition in schools, and of Greek and Latin oratory as the primary rhetorical genre. He also discusses the overlapping disciplines of ancient philosophy and religion and their interaction with rhetoric. The result is a broad and engaging history of classical rhetoric that will prove especially useful for students and for others who want an overview of classical rhetoric in condensed form.</p></p><p><b>George A. Kennedy </b>is Paddison Professor of Classics, Professor of Comparative Literature, and Adjunct Professor of Speech Communication at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill."The discipline of rhetoric, as Mr. Kennedy shows meticulously, was central to ancient life." (<i>The Economist</i>)<br><br>"The panoptic vision, the reliable accounts, and deeply conservative view of what constitutes rhetoric and rhetorical theory have justly made these books standard for classicists and other disciplines. . . .

Since Plato first animadverted on their activities, the Sophists have commonly been presented as little better than intellectual mountebanks - a picture which Professor Kerferd forcefully challenges here. Interpreting the evidence with care, he shows them to have been part of an exciting and historically crucial intellectual movement. At the centre of their teaching was a form of relativism, most famously expressed by Protagoras as &#39;Man is the measure of all things&#39;, and which they developed in a wide range of views - on knowledge and argument, virtue, government, society, and the gods. On all these subjects the Sophists did far more than simply provoke Plato to thought. Their contributions were substantial and serious; they inaugurated the debate on many central philosophical questions and decisively shifted the focus of philosophical attention from the cosmos to man.</p><p></p><h2>Adobe Illustrator Creative Cloud Revealed</h2><p>ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CREATIVE CLOUD REVEALED offers you comprehensive coverage in all areas of Adobe Illustrator.

After surveying the Western roots of transpersonal psychiatry and psychology in William James, Carl Jung, and Christian and Jewish mysticism, the book reviews the rich contributions of such differing cultures as shamanism, Hinduism, and Buddhism, illustrating the influence of these traditions on the therapeutic community. The authors then proceed to the latest scientific research on meditation, psychedelics, altered states, and parapsychology. Organizing human experience into a continuum - from a basic level dominated by biological factors to personal, psychological structures and on to complex, spiritual experiences - seasoned transpersonal clinicians discuss distinctive issues, problems, and treatments at each level. Through engaging, real-life cases, the contributors describe practical techniques, including the outcomes and risks of various interventions.

The first section, "An Age of Crisis and Discovery (1648-1715)," treats the period between the Peace of Westphalia and the death of Louis XIV as a time of political experimentation, colonial exploitation, hardening social lines, economic regression, and scientific advance. The second section covers the period known retrospectively as the "Ancien R�gime" (1715-1789). Eighteenth-century politics are viewed as replete with confrontation and conflict; and a broadened view of the Enlightenment emphasizes the significance of print culture, while also introducing the reader to sites of sociability such as academies, salons, Masonic lodges, and coffeehouses.</p> <br><br><p>This is the third edition, revised and expanded, of <i>Crisis, Absolutism, Revolution: Europe 1648-1789</i>, and new to it is an examination of European contact with Africa, the Americas, and South and East Asia. More attention is also paid to the slave trade, women, family life, religion, exploration, and the emergence of a civil society. It contains an index, 17 maps, and 20 illustrations.</p></p><p><p><b>Raymond Birn</b> is Professor Emeritus at the University of Oregon, and also the author of <i>Forging Rousseau: Print, Commerce and Cultural Manipulation in the Late Enlightenment</i>.</p><p>Raymond Birn's stimulating update of his classic <i>Crisis, Absolutism, Revolution: Europe and the World, 1648-1789 </i>interweaves political narrative and two vital historical themes: the emergence of the Atlantic world and the socio-economic basis of material life. Deeply thoughtful and clearly argued, Birn's book is one of the best treatments of the early-modern period; and its insight into eastern European events and the interaction of Europeans with the wider world is particularly well-done. For those who liked Colin Jones' <i>The Great Nation</i>, Birn's text is written in the same engaging, readable style.</p> (Jeff Horn, Manhattan College, author of <i>"Qui parle pour la nation?"

Filling that void for both students and professionals working in different branches of engineering, this versatile instructional resource comprises five flexible, self-contained sections:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Governing Equations</em></strong> deals with the derivation of the basic conservation laws, flow kinematics, and some basic theorems of fluid mechanics. </li> <li><em><strong>Ideal-Fluid Flow</strong></em> covers two- and three-dimensional potential flows and surface waves. </li> <li><em><strong>Viscous Flows of Incompressible Fluids</strong></em> discusses exact solutions, low-Reynolds-number approximations, boundary-layer theory, and buoyancy-driven flows. </li> <li><em><strong>Compressible Flow of Inviscid Fluids</strong></em> addresses shockwaves as well as one- and multidimensional flows. </li> <li><em><strong>Methods of Mathematical Analysis</strong></em> summarizes some commonly used analysis techniques. Additional appendices offer a synopsis of vectors, tensors, Fourier series, thermodynamics, and the governing equations in the common coordinate systems.</li></ul> <p>The book identifies the phenomena associated with the various properties of compressible, viscous fluids in unsteady, three-dimensional flow situations. It provides techniques for solving specific types of fluid-flow problems, and it covers the derivation of the basic equations governing the laminar flow of Newtonian fluids, first assessing general situations and then shifting focus to more specific scenarios. </p> <p>The author illustrates the process of finding solutions to the governing equations. In the process, he reveals both the mathematical methodology and physical phenomena involved in each category of flow situation, which include ideal, viscous, and compressible fluids. This categorization enables a clear explanation of the different solution methods and the basis for the various physical consequences of fluid properties and flow characteristics. Armed with this new understanding, readers can then apply the appropriate equation results to deal with the particular circumstances of their own work.</p></p><p><p><strong>Iain G.

In this important book, four prominent legal scholars from the tradition of critical race theory draw on the experience of injury from racist hate speech to develop a first amendment interpretation that recognizes such injuries. In their critique of first amendment orthodoxy,&#x201d; the authors argue that only a history of racism can explain why defamation, invasion of privacy, and fraud are exempt from free-speech guarantees while racist and sexist verbal assaults are not.The rising tide of verbal violence on college campuses has increased the intensity of the hate speech&#x201d; debate. This book demonstrates how critical race theory can be brought to bear against both conservative and liberal ideology to motivate a responsible regulation of hate speech. The impact of feminist theory is also evident throughout. The authors have provided a rare and powerful example of the application of critical theory to a real-life problem.This timely and necessary book will be essential reading for those experiencing the conflicts of free-speech issues on campus students, faculty, administrators, and legislators as well as for scholars of jurisprudence. It will also be a valuable classroom tool for teachers in political science, sociology, law, education, ethnic studies, and women's studies.</p><p>In this important book, four prominent legal scholars from the tradition of critical race theory draw on the experience of injury form racist hate speech to develop a first amendment interpretation that recognizes such injuries.<b>Mari J.

In this new study Chaim Perelman continues to develop his ideas on the theory of rhetoric, now even more cogently and persuasively presented. Pruned of much detail present in the earlier book, this new work captures the essence of his thought in a style and presentation suitable to the program and needs of an English-speaking audience. It is an ideal instruction medium for students approaching theories of informal argumentation for the first time. Perelman raises the questions, "How do claims to reasonableness arise in prose that is not formally logical?" and "What does 'reasonableness' mean for some who speaks of 'reasonable men' or 'beyond reasonable doubt'?" He then shows how claims to rationality are embedded in a number of verbal structures heretofore considered exclusively ornamental or dispositional. He identifies and discusses many argumentative techniques in addition to the quasi-logical methods conventionally treated in textbooks and notes numerous subforms of argumentation within each of the general types he identifies.</p><p>Chaim Perelman (1912&#x2013;1984) was a professor at the University of Brussels and an internationally recognized expert on rhetoric.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Mahabharata</h2><p>Few works in world literature have inspired so vast an audience, in nations with radically different languages and cultures, as the&nbsp;<i>Mahabharata,</i>&nbsp;written some 2,000 years ago and probably the longest Indian epic ever composed.

Drawn with wit and grace, these clever sketches do not try to please or flatter the architectural establishment. Rather, they make an impassioned argument against what Krier sees as the unquestioned doctrines and unacknowledged absurdities of contemporary architecture. Thus he shows us a building bearing a suspicious resemblance to Norman Foster's famous London &#x201c;gherkin&#x201d; as an example of &#x201c;priapus hubris&#x201d; (threatened by detumescence and &#x201c;priapus nemesis&#x201d;); he charts &#x201c;Random Uniformity&#x201d; (&#x201c;fake simplicity&#x201d;) and &#x201c;Uniform Randomness&#x201d; (&#x201c;fake complexity&#x201d;); he draws bloated &#x201c;bulimic&#x201d; and disproportionately scrawny &#x201c;anorexic&#x201d; columns flanking a graceful &#x201c;classical&#x201d; one; and he compares &#x201c;private virtue&#x201d; (modernist architects' homes and offices) to &#x201c;public vice&#x201d; (modernist architects' &#x201c;creations&#x201d;). Krier wants these witty images to be tools for re-founding traditional urbanism and architecture. He argues for mixed-use cities, of &#x201c;architectural speech&#x201d; rather than &#x201c;architectural stutter,&#x201d; and pointedly plots the man-vehicle-landneed ratio of &#x201c;sub-urban man&#x201d; versus that of a city dweller. In an age of energy crisis, he writes (and his drawings show), we &#x201c;build in the wrong places, in the wrong patterns, materials, densities, and heights, and for the wrong number of dwellers&#x201d;; a return to traditional architectures and building and settlement techniques can be the means of ecological reconstruction. Each of Krier's provocative and entertaining images is worth more than a thousand words of theoretical abstraction.</p></p><p>Architect and urbanist L�on Krier has taught at the Architectural Association, the Royal College of Arts, the University of Virginia, and Princeton and Yale Universities and has been an architectural consultant to the Prince of Wales since 1988. He is the recipient of numerous prizes, including the Driehaus Prize for Classical Architecture and Jefferson Memorial Gold Medal. He is the author of the award-winning <i>Architecture: Choice or Fate</i> and other books.<p>L�on Krier makes an argument in favor of traditional urbanism which is all the more persuasive in that it is made without words. These amusing and insightful drawings help us understand the torments to which our visual, aesthetic, moral, and civic senses have been subjected by the apostles of Le Corbusier and Mies Van der Rohe, and to recognize that it is not we but they who are to blame for the fact that we find it hard to live with modernist buildings. Krier's is a humane and gentle vision of what a city might be, and it deserves to be the more widely studied for its refusal to announce itself&#x2015;as modernism announced itself&#x2015;as the voice of the Zeitgeist. Krier's urbanism is timeless common sense, transcribed into drawings that leave no room for dissent.</p>&#x2015;<b>Roger Scruton</b>, writer and philosopher<br><br><p>L�on Krier is our present-day Pugina master thinker and propagandist whose drawings, along with his passionate speech and writing, have changed the way we think about buildings and cities. In the tradition of Pugin, Ebenezer Howard, and Camillo Sitte, Krier issues a 'call to order' prompting reflection and action in defense of the city as an appropriate setting for the conduct of civilized human life. Krier's 'doodles' collected here, with all their imagination, humor, and righteous indignation, offer us the most hopeful visions of architecture and urbanism visible today.</p>&#x2015;<b>Steven W. Semes</b>, Academic Director, Rome Studies Program, School of Architecture, University of Notre Dame<br><br><p>L�on Krier has already influenced a generation of urban designers by finding the roots of the sustainable city in traditional architecture and urbanism. With his new book <i>Drawing for Architecture</i>, Krier takes the argument to the next level, exposing the emptiness of modern architectural and urban theory and practice through an inspired combination of reasoning and illustration. The book should be a required reading for architects and urbanists, as it not only teaches the power of drawing as polemic, but also provides a master class in the relationship of architecture to the city.</p>&#x2015;<b>Hank Dittmar</b>, Chief Executive, The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment</p><h2>Math Workbook For The GED Test, 4th Edition (Barron&#39;s AP)</h2><p>This self-teaching workbook offers extensive preparation and brush-up in math for all who plan to take the GED High School Equivalency Test.

The philosophy used in the material selected for this text is that individual weapons come and go, but the principles of their operation largely remain the same. Some subjects are covered in greater detail than needed for an introductory course to allow this text to serve as a basic reference to take into professional life.<br><p>The text was written to be inclusive of all college majors; as such a conscious effort was made when possible to apply algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and avoid calculus. Therefore, many of the equations derived are 1st order, and provide approximations that are sufficient to illustrate the relative performance parameters of variables used in weapon system design. These same theories and principles can then be applied to actual sensors and weapons using operational parameters and specifications determined from technical manuals and warfare publications.<br></p><p>Material has been drawn from pervious texts of the same title that have explained the principles for the last 40 years. Much of the work can be traced to the work completed by the Bureau of Naval Weapons in the 1960's. It was updated and expanded in the 1980's version and incorporated in this text. In some cases, principles of systems that the U.S. Navy no longer uses are described in a belief that sometimes it is good to know where you have been to know where you are going. In addition, many countries and organizations still employ some of these lower technology systems. Therefore, it is necessary to understand their basic capabilities. With advent of new technologies and methods, this text will require periodic updating.</p></p><p>Lt.Cdr.

The book revolves around the central idea that writers improve most quickly by combining the powers of technique ("craft") with creativity ("magic"). Applying this method to news and feature writing--both print and online--it focuses on leads, organization, transition, clarity, drama, and other elements that drive good writing toward excellence. <br> Aimed at students in upper-level undergraduate writing and reporting courses, <em>Writing as Craft and Magic</em> provides a clear and succinct instructional system--with practical models, a wealth of examples, and step-by-step guides--to help students understand and apply craft and magic to daily assignments. Author Carl Sessions Stepp, a seasoned journalist at the national level, structures his system in three parts. He first evokes the art of writing, then applies that art to standard journalistic writing, and concludes with a strong section on advanced writing techniques for features. He also offers advice and tips on how newsrooms currently operate in the age of multimedia journalism. This revised edition includes an expanded exercise section at the end of each chapter, more coverage of the demands of multimedia journalism (convergence), and updated chapters on incorporating the Internet into research and writing for the daily news cycle.<br></p><p>Carl Sessions Stepp is at University of Maryland.<br>"FINALLY--a textbook on writing that's not a textbook but a real source of practical advice!"--Terry Clark, <em>University of Central Oklahoma</em><p></p><br>"I'm a huge fan of this book. . . . Stepp's work manages to communicate the more mysterious nature of creativity in writing in a coherent, readily accessible way."--Kim Walsh-Childers, <em>University of Florida</em><p></p><br>"The lessons are straightforward, clear, and well-reasoned. . . . Stepp's categorization of the yin and the yang of journalism as 'craft' and 'magic' is brilliant, hitting just the right note for my students."--John Lenger, <em>Harvard University Extension School</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Biogeography</h2><p><em>Biogeography</em>, first published in 1983, is one of the most comprehensive text and general reference books in the natural sciences. The fifth edition builds on the strengths of previous editions to provide an insightful and integrative explanation of how geographic variation across terrestrial and marine environments has influenced the fundamental processes of immigration, extinction, and evolution to shape species distributions and nearly all patterns of biological diversity. It is an empirically and conceptually rich text that illustrates general patterns and processes using examples from a broad diversity of life forms, time periods and aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. <br><br><em>Biogeography,</em> Fifth Edition, is written as a primary text for undergraduate and graduate courses, and is also an invaluable reference for biogeographers, ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and conservation biologists. Its fundamental assertion is that patterns in biological diversity make little sense unless viewed within an explicit geographic context. Starting from principal patterns and fundamental principles, and assuming only a rudimentary knowledge of biology, geography, and Earth history, the text explains the relationships between geographic variation in biological diversity and the geological, ecological, and evolutionary processes that have produced them.<br><br>The use of color illustrations, evaluated and optimized for colorblind readers, has transformed our abilities to illustrate key concepts and empirical patterns in the geography of nature. By providing a description of the historical development of biogeography, evolution and ecology, along with a comprehensive account of the principal patterns, fundamental principles and recent advances in each of these fields of science, our ultimate vision is for <em>Biogeography</em> to serve as the centerpiece of a one- or two-semester core course in biological diversity.<br><br><strong>Instructor's Resource Library</strong><br>The <em>Biogeography</em>, Fifth Edition, Instructor's Resource Library includes all of the textbook's figures (both art and photographs) and tables in electronic format.

John Maynard Smith&#39;s concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy is relevant whenever the best thing for an animal or plant to do depends on what others are doing. The theory leads to testable predictions about the evolution of behaviour, of sex and genetic systems, and of growth and life history patterns. This book contains a full account of the theory, and of the data relevant to it. The account is aimed at senior undergraduate and graduate students, teachers and research workers in animal behaviour, population genetics and evolutionary biology. The book will also be of interest to mathematicians and game theorists; the mathematics has been largely confined to appendixes so that the main text may be easily followed by biologists.</p><p>By applying game theory to the problems of population biology, the author has succeeded in inventing new and interesting ways of looking at populations and has developed a theory leading to testable predictions.John Maynard Smith is an eminent evolutionary biologist and author of many books on evolution, both for scientists and the general public.

Offering a fundamental challenge to orthodox conceptions of feudalism, Susan Reynolds argues that the concepts of fiefs and vassalage that have been central to the understanding of medieval society for hundreds of years are in fact based on a misunderstanding of the primary sources.<br> Reynolds demonstrates convincingly that the ideas of fiefs and vassalage as currently understood, far from being the central structural elements of medieval social and economic relations, are a conceptual lens through which historians have focused the details of medieval life. This lens, according to Reynolds, distorts more than it clarifies. With the lens removed, the realities of medieval life will have the chance to appear as they really are: more various, more individual, more complex, and perhaps richer than has previously been supposed. <br> This is a radical new examination of social relations within the noble class and between lords and their vassals, the distillation of wide-ranging research by a leading medieval historian. It will revolutionize the way we think of the Middle Ages.<br></p><p>Fiefs and Vassals sets out to change our view of the medieval world.

With emphasis on practical application and quantitative skill development, this book weaves together these disparate elements in a single<br> coherent textbook for senior undergraduate and graduate students. It reviews analytical techniques, explaining the mathematical and statistical principles behind them, and shows how these can be used to formulate<br> realistic objectives within an ecological framework.&nbsp;</p> <p>This third edition is comprehensive and up-to-date, and includes:</p> <ul> <li><br> Brand new chapters that disseminate rapidly developing topics in the field: habitat use and selection; habitat fragmentation, movement, and corridors; population viability. analysis, the consequences of climate change; and evolutionary responses to disturbance</li> <li><br> A thorough updating of all chapters to present important areas of wildlife research and management with recent developments and examples.</li> <li><br> A new online study aid &#x2013; a wide variety of downloadable computer programs in the freeware packages R and Mathcad, available through a companion website. Worked examples enable readers to practice calculations explained in the text and to develop a solid understanding of key statistical procedures and population models commonly used in wildlife ecology and management.</li> </ul> The first half of the book provides a solid background in key ecological concepts. The second half uses these concepts to develop a deeper understanding of the principles underlying wildlife management and conservation. Global examples of real-life management situations provide a broad perspective on the international problems of conservation, and detailed case histories demonstrate concepts and quantitative analyses. This third edition is<br> also valuable to professional wildlife managers, park rangers, biological resource managers, and those<br> working in ecotourism.</p><p><p><b>Professor John Fryxell</b> currently teaches in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of Guelph, Canada, where he has worked closely with a number of university and government scientists to develop sustainable conservation strategies for elk, woodland caribou, wolves, and marten.

Three days later, her body, badly bruised and waterlogged, was found floating in the shallow waters of the Hudson River just a few feet from the Jersey shore. Her story, parlayed into a long celebrated unsolved mystery, became grist for penny presses, social reformers, and politicians alike, and an impetus for popular literature, including Edgar Allan Poe's pioneering detective story "The Mystery of Marie Roget."<br><br>In <em>The Mysterious Death of Mary Rogers</em>, historian Amy Gilman Srebnick brilliantly recaptures the story of Mary Rogers, showing how Rogers represented an emerging class of women who took advantage of the greater economic and sexual opportunities available to them in urban America, and how her death became a touchstone for the voicing of mid-nineteenth century concerns over sexual license, the changing roles of women, law and order, and abortion. Rogers's death, first thought due to a murderous gang of rapists and later tacitly understood to be the result of an ill-performed abortion, quickly became a source of popular entertainment, a topic of political debate, and an inspiration to public policy. The incident and the city's response to it provides a fascinating window into the urban culture and consciousness of the mid-1800s. Indeed, in Rogers's name, and as a direct result of her death, two important pieces of legislation were passed in 1845: the New York City Police Reform Act which effectively modernized the city's system of policing, and the New York State law criminalizing abortion.<br><br><em>The Mysterious Death of Mary Rogers</em> tells a story of a death, but more importantly it also tells the story of a life--that of Mary Rogers--and of the complex urban social world of which she was a part. Like the city in which she lived, Mary Rogers was a source of wonder, mystery, and fear, provoking desire, and inspiring narrative.<br></p><p><br><strong>Amy Gilman Srebnick</strong> is Professor of History at Montclair State University. She was co-editor of <em>The Mythmaking Frame of Mind: Social Imagination and American Culture</em>.<br><br>"With its combination of romance, sex, and violence, Rogers's story captured the allure and danger of urban life and, Srebnick argues, introduced previously unspeakable acts into public discourse."--<em>Time Out New York</em><p></p><br>"In a mesmerizing, superb study, intriguingly illustrated with period engravings and woodcuts,...Srebnick uses the Rogers saga to throw a floodlight on sexuality in antebellum America, women's history, urban mass culture, the rise of the popular press, and the birth of detective fiction."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"A wonderfully astute and complex investigation of gender, class, and cultural representation in the urban world of antebellum America."--Eric Sundquist, Department of English, UCLA<p></p><br>"Everyone loves a good mystery. And the mysteries abound in Amy Gilman Srebnick's absorbing new work....With this book, the mysterious death of Mary Rogers should take its place beside other crimes that have shocked Americans into action, or at least into deep reflection about our society--Kitty Genovese and Nicole Brown Simpson are only the tip of the iceberg."--<em>New York Law Journal</em><p></p><br>"Highly recommended for all readers."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Mysterious Death of Mary Rogers</em> is immensely readable, fluently written, well-paced, and intrinsically of great value. It is vivid and highly evocative of the urban culture--persons, events, buildings and streets, print culture, complex moral codes, etc.--it treats; and it is particularly effective in its linkage of the mysteries of the city with the mysteries of female sexuality in this period."--Karen Halttunen, Professor of History, University of California, Davis<p></p><br>"Srebnick covers the much-traversed ground regarding the details surrounging Rogers's life and death.

This undergraduate nursing text distills these challenging topics into an engaging, easy-to-read format that facilitates ready application to any practice setting. Written specifically for RN to BSN and second-degree nursing programs, the book is the only such text grounded in nurses' own understanding and experience. Concise and practical, it supports foundational concepts with real-life case studies and clinical applications and reinforces information with interactive quizzes and multimedia materials. The book's content fulfills one of the AACN's key Essentials of Baccalaureate Education. Written by a health economics and policy expert, former dean, and award-winning teacher, the text synthesizes the vast scope of health economics to create an easily understandable guide for nursing action from bedside to boardroom.</p> <p>The text describes the relationship between nursing and health care economics and traces the history of our health care system from the early 1900s through today. It contrasts the economics of health care with that of classic free markets and discusses the intersection of ethics and economics, providing nurses with the ethical tools to thoughtfully consider dilemmas arising from today's focus on the bottom line. The book describes how to use economic principles to shape organizations and public policy and includes a step-by-step, skillbuilding guide to enhancing professional influence through participation on governing boards. Complex financial principles are broken down to facilitate understanding for nurses with no prior knowledge of this discipline. The book also includes relevant information on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and is compatible with online teaching and coursework.

That was a dream, of course, but many of the most important things, I find, are the ones learned in your sleep. Speech, tennis, music, skiing, manners, love&#x2014;you try them waking and perhaps balk at the jump, and then you're over. You've caught the rhythm of them once and for all, in your sleep at night. The city, of course, can wreck it. So much insomnia. So many rhythms collide. The salesgirl, the landlord, the guests, the bystanders, sixteen varieties of social circumstance in a day.

"Because then you lose them."<br>&nbsp;<br>A large rat crossed my path last night on Fifty-seventh Street. It came out from under a wooden fence at a vacant lot near Bendel's, paused for traffic, and then streaked across to the uptown sidewalk, sat awhile in the dark, and vanished. It was my second rat this week. The first was in a Greek restaurant where there are lap-height sills under all the windows. The rat ran along the sills, straight toward, then past me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See that?" Will said, sipping from his beer glass.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Large mouse," I said. "Even nice hotels have small mice now, in the bars and lobbies." I had last seen Will in Oakland; before that, in Louisiana. He does law. Then something, perhaps a startled sense of my own peripheral vision, registered on my left, coming toward my face fast. My fork clattered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You were all right, there," Will said, grinning, "until you lost your cool."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second rat, of course, may have been the first rat farther uptown, in which case I am either being followed or the rat keeps the same rounds and hours I do. I think sanity, however, is the most profound moral option of our time. Two rats, then. Cabdrivers can't even hear directions through those new partitions, which don't seem to me really bulletproof, although, of course, I've never checked it. Soundproof. One's fingers jam, certainly, in the new receptacles for money. Well, somebody sold the partitions. Someone bought them. Crooked, clearly. There doesn't seem to be a spirit of the times. When I started to get out of bed at an unlikely early morning hour, Will, who pitches into sleep as violently as his waking life is gentle, said, "Just stay here. <i>Angst</i> is common." I did find a cab home, in the rain, outside an armory.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To the Dow-Jones averages," the father said, raising his glass. It was his sixty-eighth birthday. His hair and mustache were silvery.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Each in his own way," the son said with a little smile. He was not a radical. He had been selling short. They laughed. The entire family&#x2014;even the grandchildren, at their separate table&#x2014;drank. The moment passed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone in the sports car, speeding through the countryside, I sang along with the radio station, tuned way up. Not the happiest of songs, Janis Joplin, not in any terms; but one ofthe nicest lines. "Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose." In a way, I guess.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are no tears here," the young construction worker said at the funeral, when the ancient union leader, with two strokes, three heart attacks, and a lung condition, died at<br>last.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "True," the priest said, surveying the mourners in the cathedral. "No tears. Either the wake went on too long or he was a hard, hard man."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rest are never going to die," a young black politician said with great bitterness. "You see them staggering out of their limousines. All Irish, all senile, all strokes. The union<br>men. Even their wives have cardiac conditions. But I know it now. They are never going to die."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They'll die, all right," the priest said, judiciously. "There's not one of them under seventy-six. You'll see. Your time will come."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To the future, then," the black politician said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shall we go to your place or to Elaine's?" the young man asked. It was 3 A.M. He was recently divorced. The same question must have been being put just then in cabs throughout New York. "To Elaine's," I said. That was where we went. To Elaine's, to the Dow-Jones averages, to the future, then, to preserve the domestic tranquility. Freedom means nothing left; cab change receptacles are hearing aids in which one's fingers jam&#x2014;when the clips are coming in quite fast, it's like waking up and trying to orient the bed. Which side can the wall be on, which side is uptown, downtown, which town is it, anyway? In some of the best motels, near airports, along highways, they have Magic Fingers, a device which, for one quarter put into a metal box, shakes the bed for sixty seconds and sends you quietly to sleep. There are no fingers about it. It is more like sleeping on a train when the tracks are good. A sticker on the metal box says that you can have Magic Fingers in your own home. I don't know anyone who has.<br>&nbsp;<br>I work for a tabloid, the <i>Standard Evening Sun</i>. Since I got this job, I have gone out with four sons of famous fathers, two businessmen with unfinished novels, three writers with a habit of saying "May I use that" when I said something that seemed to them in character, and a revolutionary editor who patted my hair and said "You're very sweet" whenever I asked him anything. I have sat, shivering on cold steps, with a band of fifteen radicals of whom ten were in analysis and six wore contact lenses. Things have changed very much, several times, since I grew up, and, like everyone in New York except the intellectuals, I have led several lives and I still lead some of them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a while, I thought I had no real interests&#x2014;no theater, concerts, museums, stamp collections. Only ambitions and ties to people, of a certain intensity. Different sorts of people. I was becoming a ward heeler of the emotional life. Now the ambitions have drifted after the interests. I have lost my sense of the whole. I wait for events to take a form. I remember somebody saying, "You've got to <i>steep</i> yourself in things." So I <i>steeped</i> myself, in thrillers, commercials, news magazines. The same person used to write "tepid" and "arguable" all over the margins of what our obituary writers wrote. I now think "tepid" and "arguable" several times a day.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the country, where I grew up, there were never so many events. Things never went quite so flat. The house was nearly always asleep and we spoke very low. When Father got up at six for his ride or his swim before breakfast, the children, having gone to bed well after midnight, were sleeping. When he came back from his office at noon, the children, pale and silent, joined him for his lunch and their breakfast. After lunch, Father had his nap, and at three Mother, having seen him off again to the office, went upstairs to rest for an hour. The family was awake and together only at supper, after which Father went to his room and Mother stayed downstairs a few minutes to talk to the children. Twenty hours out of twenty-four, in short, the hush of sleep layover the house. Nobody thought of waking anybody. Sometimes a stupid child would tie a firecracker to a crayfish or a frog just once, and light the fuse. Or give a piece of sugar to a raccoon, which in its odd fastidiousness would wash that sugar in a brook till there was nothing left.<br>&nbsp;<br>But here. I used to wonder why the victims of some small sensational tragedy&#x2014;the parents of a little girl who had just been thrown from the roof of her tenement by a deranged older boy, or the family of a model son who had just gone clear out of his mind and murdered a friend&#x2014;never shut the door in my face when I came for an interview. They never do. They open the door; they bring out the family album and the baby anecdotes. I used to think it was out of a loyalty to memory, or a will to have the papers get it right. I still think it's partly that, and partly being stunned by publicity and grief. But now I know it's mostly an agony of trying to please, a cast of mind so deep and amiable that it is as stark in consciousness as death.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the matter of Doberman pinschers, I like dogs that are large and hairy and friendly and sleep a lot, with sad eyes behind the hair. When I was young, there was a lady on our road who had a Doberman pinscher, bred sharp, vicious, and streamlined, as they all are, like a honed wolf. It meant that whenever a neighborhood child was riding along the tar road on his bicycle, if the Doberman was out, there had to be an immediate leap from the bicycle, and a crouching on bruised knees behind a high stone wall, before the owner called her<br>dog back. The dog was devoted to the lady, who, as it happened, did have cancer. For years, I thought of the devotion of Dobermans to their owners, and their savagery to others, as something almost in their favor. Almost. Then I read a newspaper story about a Doberman that had turned, after many years, upon its mistress, an old lady. When they found her the next morning, it turned out that the lady must have run from room to room, trying to shut the door before the dog got to her, just too feeble or perhaps unbelieving to escape it. A love story gone off the tracks, one could say in a disillusioned moment. Far off.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, I work with Will at the foundation, rewriting requests for grants. No such job technically exists, but that's what I do. I try to recycle the film-is-the-medium<br>and the cable-television-for-the-ghetto people, and help the Blake fanatics and the street reformers who work very hard. Sometimes I miss, or lose, the point. Late-sleeping utopians,<br>especially, persist like mercury. I am a fanatic myself, although not a woman of temperament. I get nervous at scenes. I stole a washcloth once from a motel in Angkor Wat. The bellboy was incensed. I had to give it back. To promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity&#x2014;I believe all that. I go to parties almost whenever I am asked. I think a high tone of moral indignation, used too often, is an ugly thing. I get up at eight. Quite often now I have a drink before eleven. In some ways, I have overshot my mark in life in spades.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was lying on a Mediterranean boat deck, on a windless day. It was odd that I should be there, but no more odd than my work, or the slums, or the places where people do find<br>themselves as their luck shifts. A girl of eighteen was taking the sun with great seriousness. The rest of our party were swimming, or playing cards below, or drinking hard. The girl<br>was blond, shy, and laconic. After two hours of silence, in that sun, she spoke. "When you have a tan," she said, "what have you got?"<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have zoomed around a lot in the brief times between months of idling. I have a tendency to get stuck in places. In spring, 1967, I was stuck in Luxor, Egypt. I had been<br>sent to Cairo by the paper. There were loudspeakers and angry rallies in the streets: I went to the pyramids and rode a camel. Then, I went to a briefing at the embassy. The foreign minister spoke of Israeli options and attrition. I wrote it down. I took a plane, an Ilyushin, to Luxor and looked at the tombs there. I arrived for my flight back to Cairo three hours early. So did others. We were told that our flight had been taken over by an American Bible-tour group called "Nine Days in the Holy Land," whose own flight had been cancelled. The scheduled people with reservations were all planeless. I was frantic. I began to cry at the desk of an airport official. He wrote it down. One of the Bible tour's two leaders said that if a<br>single person from his group was left off the plane the tour would never again come to Egypt. I wondered where else they were going to take their "Nine Days in the Holy Land" to. Anaheim, Azusa, Cucamonga. I was desperate. The Egyptian pilot looked at me a second. Just before takeoff, he led me to the cockpit, where I sat, with one of the group's two guides, beside him. The threatening tour guide had been left behind. We flew with a certain exhilaration. A few days after that, there was the war.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know someone who is trying to get rid of a myna bird&#x2014;I mean, find a loving owner. For a year now, he has spent half an hour each day underneath a dark cloth with the bird and a timer. He says hello, hello, hello for the entire session. The bird says nothing. It sometimes squawks at sunrise. Then there is the question of apartments. Lucas, who has the<br>desk beside mine at the paper, moved into a place where the last tenant somehow left a lonely cat. Lucas is one of the nicest people I know; he has an allergy to cat hairs. He called<br>everyone he knew. Finally, he heard of someone who already had four cats. He called her. "Well, you see, I already have four cats," the girl said. "I know," Lucas answered. He just<br>thought maybe a fifth . . . "No, no," the girl said. "I mean four <i>extra</i> cats. Somebody gave me." There was a pause. "Oh, what the hell," she said. Lucas brought the ninth cat over. Next door, there is a twelve-year-old who wants to give her rabbit to somebody with a happy home out in the country. She is obsessed with the idea that the wrong kind of person might take the rabbit in bad faith and eat it. She thinks somebody ate her gerbil. No one eats gerbils. It is strange to think that most of the children under six whom one knows and loves, gives presents to, whatever, are not going to remember most emotional events of those first years, on the couch, or in jail, or in a bank, wherever they may find themselves when they are twenty-five.<br>&nbsp;<br>...</p><h2>The Penland School of Crafts Book of Jewelry Making</h2><p>Here for the first time in book form, the artist-craftsmen of Penland reveal their jewelry-making techniques - along with a set of magnificent projects - which have drawn thousands of students to the celebrated Penland School of Crafts, an Arts and Crafts educational center located in the Blue Ridge Mountains in Spruce Pine, North Carolina, about 50 miles from Asheville. In a fascinating step-by-step text, these master jewelers explain exactly how to make pieces of jewelry they have designed especially for this book. In language clear enough for the beginner to follow, they teach their own basic techniques, as well as some innovative ones that have never before been described in print. They also include lists of supplies needed to execute the projects, sources for obtaining them, and a glossary of standard jewelry-making terms. The instructional texts are enhanced by a series of clos-up photographs - nearly 150 in all - which demonstrate with stunning clarity each step in the jewelry-making process. In addition, there are over 40 exquisite full-color photographs, forming a gallery of these artists&#39; outstanding creations. The texts are further highlight by autobiographical sketches of the artists, in which they reveal how they got their start, how they work, and what they think about jewelry making today.

Being an Austrian, he was interned in India. On his third attempt, he succeeded in escaping from the internment camp and fled into Tibet. After a series of experiences in a country never crossed before by a Westerner, Harrer reached the Forbidden City of Lhasa. He stayed there for seven years, learned the language and acquired a greater understanding of Tibet and the Tibetans. He became friend and tutor to the young Dalai Lama and finally accompanied him into India when he was put to flight by the Red Chinese invasion. This film tie-in edition includes an epilogue from the author describing his return to Tibet in the 1990s.</p><p>Originally published in 1953, this adventure classic recounts Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer&#39;s 1943 escape from a British internment camp in India, his daring trek across the Himalayas, and his happy sojourn in Tibet, then, as now, a remote land little visited by foreigners.

Ambitious and hungry for adventure, he fell in love with the challenge the Alps presented and set out to conquer them peak by peak. Whymper made quick work of the challenge, racking up dozens of first ascents and acquiring a reputation as one of the best in the nascent field of mountaineering. But on the Matterhorn, considered to be mountaineering's Holy Grail at the time, Whymper met with failure again and again. On his eighth attempted ascent he finally succeeded, becoming the first man to reach its magnificent peak. The victory came at a heavy cost, however, as Whymper watched four of his companions fall to their deaths on the descent. It was a tragedy that would cast a shadow over the remainder of his life.<br><br>Published in 1871, <i>Scrambles Amongst the Alps</i> is Whymper's own story of his nine years spent climbing in the Alps. One of the first books devoted to the sheer thrill of mountaineering, it is a breathtaking account of the triumph of man over mountain in a time before thermal clothing, nylon ropes, global positioning systems, and air rescues. It also offers Whymper's controversial story of the tragedy on the Matterhorn. One of the best adventure books of all time, <i>Scrambles Amongst the Alps</i> is an essential classic of climbing literature by one of mountaineering's most legendary figures.</p><p><b>Edward Whymper</b> (1840&#x2013;1911) was an English mountaineer and explorer with dozens of first ascents under his belt, the most famous being that of the Matterhorn.

Coffeehouses have provided places to plan revolutions, write poetry, do business, and meet friends. The coffee industry has dominated and molded the economy, politics, and social structure of entire countries.Mark Pendergrast introduces the reader to an eccentric cast of characters, all of them with a passion for the golden bean. <i>Uncommon Grounds</i> is nothing less than a coffee-flavored history of the world.</p><p>Since its discovery in an Ethiopian rainforest centuries ago, coffee has brewed up a rich and troubled history, according to <i>Uncommon Grounds</i>, a sweeping book by business writer Mark Pendergrast. Over the years, the beverage has fomented revolution, spurred deforestation, enriched a few while impoverishing the many, and addicted millions with its psychoactive caffeine. Coffee is now the world's second most valuable legal commodity, behind oil, according to Pendergrast, who is also author of <i>For God, Country, and Coca-Cola</i>.<p> "A good cup of coffee can turn the worst day tolerable, can provide an all-important moment of contemplation, can rekindle a romance," he writes. "And yet, poetic as its taste may be, coffee's history is rife with controversy and politics." For example, coffee bankrolled Idi Amin's genocidal regime in Uganda and the Sandinistas' revolution in Nicaragua. <i>Uncommon Grounds</i> provides some fascinating tidbits. Did you know that coffeehouses helped spawn the French and American revolutions? Or that coffee supplanted alcohol as a favorite breakfast drink in Britain in the late 1600s, and later became a patriotic American beverage after the Boston Tea Party? Pendergrast also details the rise and fall of regional coffee brands in the United States, the role of advertising in the industry, the global economic impact of coffee prices, and the recent emergence of specialty-coffee retailers--Starbucks, for example. Finally, he explores the social and environmental ramifications of coffee and highlights recent attempts to encourage a livable wage and environmental protection in coffee-producing nations such as Brazil. Pendergrast also includes an appendix on "how to brew the perfect cup." This wide-ranging book is a good read for those curious about the history and context behind that morning cup of coffee, as well as for those strictly interested in the business side of the industry. <i>--Dan Ring</i></p>A Harvard graduate, investigative journalist and scholar, Mark Pendergrast lives in Vermont.

In 1995, he discovered the T-shaped burial complex of Ramses II's 50 sons--arguably the most significant discovery since Howard Carter unearthed King Tut's tomb in 1922. Weeks's account of this historic event is filled with a sense of awe and wonder. "[I]n my imagination," he writes, recalling a vision of the statue of Osiris, god of the afterlife, "I could see the ancient funerals that took place three thousand years ago. I could hear ancient priests chanting prayers and shaking tambourines ... I could smell incense and feel priestly robes brush my arm as the funeral procession moved slowly past. For an instant I felt transported back in time: it was 1275 BCE and this was ancient Thebes."<p> Weeks also points out what his discovery may tell us about the powerful, redhaired pharoah who ruled ancient Egypt for 67 years (1279-1212 BC), including the possibility that he was the pharaoh of Exodus. He elaborates upon his profession's risks, from excavations in narrow, debris-filled and claustraphobic surroundings to working under the gunfire of terrorist attacks. And he reminds us that his discovery by no means brings Egyptology to a conclusion: "Every generation of Egyptologists asks different questions of its data and data are a finite resource. We will leave parts of KV5 undug so that archeologists of the future, armed with new questions and new excavation techniques, can seek new answers to old questions and to others we haven't even dreamed of." <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p>Dr. Kent Weeks is an Egyptologist with the American University inCairo.

There was sufficient time for reporting on a breaking news story without having to constantly relay what was being learned on the newspaper&#x2019;s web page. <br><br> There were no televised panels of &#x201c;experts&#x201d; and journalists on cable TV who began every answer to every question with the two deadliest words in the media world&#x2014;&#x201c;I think.&#x201d; We are sodden with fake news, hyped-up and incomplete information, and false assertions delivered nonstop by our daily newspapers, our televisions, our online news agencies, our social media, and our President. <br><br> Yes, it&#x2019;s a mess. And there is no magic bullet, no savior in sight for the serious media. The mainstream newspapers, magazines, and television networks will continue to lay off reporters, reduce staff, and squeeze the funds available for good reporting, and especially for investigative reporting, with its high cost, unpredictable results, and its capacity for angering readers and attracting expensive lawsuits. The newspapers of today far too often rush into print with stories that are essentially little more than tips, or hints of something toxic or criminal. For lack of time, money, or skilled staff, we are besieged with &#x201c;he said, she said&#x201d; stories in which the reporter is little more than a parrot. I always thought it was a newspaper&#x2019;s mission to search out the truth and not merely to report on the dispute. Was there a war crime? The newspapers now rely on a negotiated United Nations report that comes, at best, months later to tell us. And have the media made any significant effort to explain why a UN report is not considered to be the last word by many throughout the world? Is there much critical reporting at all about the UN? Do I dare ask about the war in Yemen? Or why Donald Trump took Sudan off his travel ban list? (The leadership in Khartoum sent troops to fight in Yemen on behalf of Saudi Arabia.) <br><br> My career has been all about the importance of telling important and unwanted truths and making America a more knowledgeable place. I was not alone in making a difference; think of David Halberstam, Charley Mohr, Ward Just, Neil Sheehan, Morley Safer, and dozens of other first-rate journalists who did so much to enlighten us about the seamy side of the Vietnam War. I know it would not be possible for me to be as freewheeling in today&#x2019;s newspaper world as it was until a decade ago, when the money crunch began. I vividly remember the day when David Remnick, the editor of <i>The New Yorker, </i>called in 2011 to ask if I could do an interview with an important source by telephone rather than fly three thousand miles to do one in person. David, who did everything possible to support my reporting on the Abu Ghraib prison horror in 2004&#x2014;he paid dearly to enable me to publish reporting pieces in three consecutive issues&#x2014;made his plea to me in what I thought was a pained, embarrassed voice, almost a whisper. <br><br> Where are the tough stories today about America&#x2019;s continuing Special Forces operations and the never-ending political divide in the Middle East, Central America, and Africa? Abuses surely continue&#x2014; war is always hell&#x2014;but today&#x2019;s newspapers and networks simply cannot afford to keep correspondents in the field, and those that do&#x2014; essentially <i>The New York Times, </i>where I worked happily for eight years in the 1970s, constantly making trouble&#x2014;are not able to finance the long-term reporting that is needed to get deeply into the corruption of the military or intelligence world. As you will read herein, I spent two years before I was able to learn what I needed to report on the CIA&#x2019;s illegal domestic spying in the 1960s and 1970s. <br><br> I do not pretend to have an answer to the problems of our media today. Should the federal government underwrite the media, as England does with the BBC? Ask Donald Trump about that. Should there be a few national newspapers financed by the public? If so, who would be eligible to buy shares in the venture? This is clearly the time to renew the debate on how to go forward. I had believed for years that all would work out, that the failing American newspapers would be supplanted by blogs, online news collectives, and weekly newspapers that would fill in the blanks on local reporting as well as on international and national news, but, despite a few successes&#x2014;VICE, BuzzFeed, Politico, and Truthout come to mind&#x2014;it isn&#x2019;t happening; as a result, the media, like the nation, are more partisan and strident. <br><br> So, consider this memoir for what it is: an account of a guy who came from the Midwest, began his career as a copyboy for a small agency that covered crime, fires, and the courts there, and eleven years later, as a freelance reporter in Washington working for a small antiwar news agency, was sticking two fingers in the eye of a sitting president by telling about a horrific American massacre, and being rewarded for it. You do not have to tell me about the wonder, and the potential, of America. Perhaps that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s very painful to think I might not have accomplished what I did if I were at work in the chaotic and unstructured journalism world of today. <br><br> Of course I&#x2019;m still trying.</p><h2>The Big Book 0f Small Stuff: 100 of the Best Inspirations From Don&#39;t Sweat the Small Stuff</h2><p><strong>The best of the best from the publishing phenomenon <em>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff</em></strong> -- in time for the series' tenth anniversary!<p>When Richard Carlson wrote <em>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff</em> in January 1997, he had no way of knowing it would be the beginning of an unrivaled publishing success story.

According to local legend, the name came from the story of an old widower who was kind and pure of heart but childless. In traditional China, that meant he had no one to support him in old age. His fellow villagers took pity and offered him a small job as the community&#x2019;s night watchman. His task was to walk around the village every two hours, marking time by beating clappers. He accepted the job but refused pay, saying the villagers should save their money to cast a bell that would replace him when he died.<br><br>Over the years, the locals saved their money, while he carried out his duties to unusual effect. During the last watch, just before dawn, he would sound his clappers especially loudly in front of the doors of lazy people, hoping to wake them and get them off to work. In front of the doors of the diligent, he was as quiet as could be, allowing them a few more minutes of sleep in the knowledge that they would get up on their own. As time went by, some villagers said his clappers anticipated the changing seasons or warned of coming storms. When they heard the steady beat, they knew what they had to do&#x2014;not just when to work or sleep, but how to live their lives, following good and avoiding evil. Eventually, the old man died, the money was counted, and the bell cast. When it was rung, it had the same miraculous effect, a bell tolling for each person.<br><br>The bell, the temple that was later built around it, and the village&#x2014;all were torn down long ago, leaving only a story and the name of a highway overpass, a subway stop, and a neighborhood of tenement homes about to be demolished. Over the past decades, this wave of destruction has rolled over the rest of the capital as well, eliminating a vast medieval city of twenty-five square miles. Beijing had once been made up of hutongs&#x2014;narrow alleys that passed between walled homes, interspersed with hundreds of temples. Superimposed over these communities was an imaginary landscape of holy mountains and deities who linked the city into a sacred bond of myth and faith. For centuries, this epitomized the political-religious state that had run China for millennia.<br><br>That changed in the twentieth century, especially after the Communist takeover in 1949. Many of the temples and hutongs were destroyed to make way for the new ideals of an atheistic, industrial society. Starting in the 1980s came economic reforms and uncontrolled real estate development, which has wiped out almost all the rest of the old city and pushed most of Beijing&#x2019;s original residents out of the city center. In the few fragments of the historic city that survived, migrants moved in. Some were poor workers from the countryside, others rich gentrifiers from somewhere else. With them came new foods&#x2014;spicy dishes from the interior or nouvelle cuisine from abroad&#x2014;and new customs, such as the mass exodus out of Beijing during holidays to rural hometowns or tropical beach resorts. Lost was a way of life, just as the local cultures of other great cities have been swamped by our restless times.<br><br>I watched this transformation since first coming to Beijing in the early 1980s. Like many people, I was disheartened and felt the city and its once-great culture were lost. But in recent years I began to realize I had been wrong. Beijing&#x2019;s culture was not dead; it was being reborn in odd corners of the city like the Temple of the Tolling Bell. It was not the same as in the past, but it was still vibrant and real&#x2014;ways of life and belief that echoed the sounds of the past.<br><br>The Temple of the Tolling Bell was the home of the Ni (pronounced &#x201c;NEE&#x201d;) family, ordinary Beijingers who had once lived in the old city near one of its most famous landmarks, the Temple of Heaven. Next door to their old home had been a much smaller temple to Our Lady of the Azure Clouds, or Bixia Yuanjun, an important Daoist goddess. The Ni family children used to play in the temple&#x2019;s three courtyards, and the family was friends with an old priest who lived there. In 1992, their house and the Daoist temple were slated for demolition to make way for the headquarters of the General Administration of Sport of China, a government agency charged with creating national glory. Faced with such a strong opponent, the Ni family did the wise thing: it yielded. As compensation, they were given money and land to build new homes in the Temple of the Tolling Bell neighborhood. It was from this new encampment outside the old city that they helped orchestrate the revival of Beijing&#x2019;s spiritual life.<br><br>On the second day of the Lunar New Year, I paid a visit to the Ni family&#x2019;s eighty-one-year-old patriarch, Ni Zhenshan. Two nights earlier, Beijingers had heralded the Year of the Dragon with loud and endless fireworks against the dark, moonless sky. Yesterday, the first day of the New Year, had been quiet. Traditionally, it is a day for staying home with one&#x2019;s family, cooking big meals, and recuperating from the previous night&#x2019;s excitement. The second day is given over to social calls, and so here I was, plodding past spent firework casings and charred paper, doing what any gentleman is supposed to do on this day: pay respects to one&#x2019;s betters and elders.<br><br>Compared with me, the Nis were both. Old Mr. Ni and his fifty-six-year-old son, Ni Jincheng, weren&#x2019;t just older; they understood infinitely more. They knew all the holidays on the traditional calendar, the right way to kowtow before a statue, how to recite sutras, which cigarettes to smoke, and which grain alcohol to drink. They knew which fruits to eat in April and why you never make a gift of a knife or a plum. They had stylish clothes made by a dead tailor, second homes acquired for a song, calligraphy from a colonel, teapots from a royal kiln, and a flock of European racing pigeons. When I asked why or how or when, they would look at me as if I had missed the point: there was no reason; this was how you lived.<br><br>Like any good gentleman, Jincheng was waiting for me at the street corner as I got out of the taxi. He was broad shouldered, with a beefy face and a thick head of hair that was combed back in a rakish wave. In his normal life, he had a desk job at the Ministry of Construction but had spent most of his career out in the field, managing projects or inspecting them for safety defects. His speech was distinctive, in part because of its volume: this was a man whose work called for him to communicate over the roar of a jackhammer. But he also peppered it with a patois of ur-Beijing dialect laden with religious expressions. He talked about karmic retribution (baoying), and when someone died, he spoke of the dark gate (xuanmen) closing. His clothes reflected his double life. Draped over his shoulders was a green army greatcoat that could have been worn by a worker, but underneath was a tailored collarless jacket made of brown silk and patterned with a stylized version of the character shou, or longevity. His cheeks were redder than usual, and he motioned for me to follow him.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll catch a cold out here,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>He grunted. &#x201c;Wang Defeng was here visiting the old man. Everyone was drinking.&#x201d;<br><br>Wang Defeng was a government official who ran the most important religious site in Beijing, Miaofengshan, or the Mountain of the Wondrous Peak, located about forty miles west of the city center. I had met the Ni family there a year earlier during the annual pilgrimage to worship Our Lady of the Azure Clouds, the same goddess whose temple had also been next to the Ni family&#x2019;s old home. During the pilgrimage, the Ni family ran a small shrine next to the main temple. It was dedicated to another popular goddess and had a stand offering free tea to pilgrims. This is known as a pilgrimage association and is meant to help the faithful by providing them with physical and moral sustenance as they climb the mountain. About eighty of these groups exist in Beijing. Some provide food and drink, while others honor the gods with acrobatics, stilt walking, humorous skits, and martial arts. During the two-week pilgrimage, many of these volunteers live on the mountain, bunking out six to a room or, like the Ni family, sleeping on cots in the back of their shrines.<br><br>The temple is owned by the government, but neither it nor Manager Wang controls the pilgrimage associations. They are independent, with an authority that comes from tradition and faith rather than power and money. Over the course of many generations, the pilgrimage associations have been handed down through clans and families, and they have developed arcane sets of rules and regulations. They choose who can ascend Miaofengshan and how to behave on the mountain. They even decide how you should greet another association member on the street. And they are crucial to the pilgrimage&#x2019;s financial success. If the groups participate, then the Miaofengshan fair is a genuine spiritual event and a destination for tens of thousands of pious pilgrims. If the groups stay away, then it&#x2019;s nothing but a carnival.<br><br>Manager Wang had not come to ask the Ni family to attend this year&#x2019;s pilgrimage; no man of culture would come at the start of the Lunar New Year on such a crude mission. Instead, he was paying a courtesy visit. A cynic might view this as the same thing, but this would be too narrow. Personal contact is how life is organized in China, whether running a pilgrimage, business, or political party. All of these have rules, regulations, or bylaws, but what really holds them together is a web of relationships that rarely fits on a flowchart. It includes who is related to whom and who has done whom a favor, when, and under what circumstances. It is about who has the personal charisma and prestige and who has donated the most money, but also it is about who is sincere in carrying out obligations&#x2014;something even the poorest person can do. Mr. Wang had visited because he was an able administrator wanting to make the next fair a success, but he didn&#x2019;t think in such unsophisticated terms; he was here because visiting Old Mr. Ni was the right thing to do. The patriarch was a great man in Beijing&#x2019;s religious scene. Not visiting him on the second day of the New Year would have been unthinkable.<br><br>Jincheng led me down a side street, turning in to an alley too narrow for a car. He pushed open the second door on our right, and three small dogs charged out, barking and wagging their tails. He walked through the first room, where his wife and several other women were playing mahjong on a dark rosewood table. They looked up and called out greetings, offering tea and sunflower seeds, which I waved off. Jincheng slid open a glass door, and we entered the back room, where his father sat waiting for me on a heavy, carved wooden chair&#x2014;a throne for one of the noblemen of Beijing&#x2019;s religious life.<br><br>Old Mr. Ni had a shaved head and thick dark eyebrows that seemed permanently arched upward in a sign of surprise and humility. He loved to talk about catching crickets, collecting gourds, and raising dogs. When I had visited him a few months earlier, we had chatted for a couple of hours about everything from calligraphy to the construction industry, where he had worked since his youth. He had told me that he had cancer but he was certain that he would recover. Now, though, I could see that the illness had overwhelmed his body. His hands clutched the armrests, as if struggling to keep his body upright. His head was bowed slightly and immobile; when I approached, he did not move. It took him a moment to open his eyes and gesture for me to take a seat next to him. Then he summoned his energy and issued a command.<br><br>&#x201c;If you want to write a book, be accurate. You don&#x2019;t want to be spouting nonsense like people on television, filming this or that, and making all sorts of misleading statements about us. Don&#x2019;t lead people astray. Do you understand?&#x201d;<br><br>I thought back to my visits to Miaofengshan. State-run television often filmed the colorful festival and aired reports on how everything was well and good with traditional Chinese culture. It rarely showed people worshipping, and avoided mentioning that this was primarily a religious event. It usually seemed like a report on a new theme park. I nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;I am not so strong anymore and am not sure I can explain everything. If I lead you astray, then you will write errors and others will be misled. We&#x2019;ll get further and further from the truth.<br><br>&#x201c;But I want you to mark this: All temples are not the same. Some are fake. When you&#x2019;re writing, you have to know the distinction. You have to know which permit pilgrims and which do not. Miaofengshan does allow them. It&#x2019;s why our tea association goes there.&#x201d;<br><br>Jincheng leaned over and whispered in my ear, reminding me how his family&#x2019;s tea association had been founded. It had been 1993, and Old Mr. Ni had been ill with kidney cancer. Surgery was imminent. He vowed that if he lived, he would make a trip to Miaofengshan to thank Our Lady of the Azure Clouds. She had looked after the family in their old home, and he was sure she would help him now. Back home, Jincheng lit incense and prayed.<br><br>The surgery had gone well, and Old Mr. Ni had recovered. The next spring, he went to Miaofengshan to fulfill his vow. Although the family had lived next to the temple of Our Lady of the Azure Clouds, they had never made the pilgrimage to her mountain. Old Mr. Ni had been just eight years old when the Japanese invaded and twenty when the Communists took power. In such tumultuous times, the flow of pilgrims had slowed to a trickle, with people worried about safety and generally too poor to afford the long trip through the mountain roads. After Mao took power, his zealots destroyed the temple. But by the mid-1990s it had been rebuilt, and the pilgrimage had resumed.<br><br>On his way down the mountain, Old Mr. Ni told Jincheng that he had an idea. He wanted to set up his own pilgrimage association to offer pilgrims tea. In a literal sense, pilgrimage associations are superfluous; nowadays, a pilgrimage usually just takes a day, and no one needs free tea or food. But the associations survive because the idea behind them is more important than their function. They symbolize piety&#x2014;a gathering of people who had enough faith to sacrifice the thousands of dollars and weeks of time that it takes to run a pilgrimage association.</p><h2>The Last Storytellers: Tales from the Heart of Morocco</h2><p>Marrakech is the heart and lifeblood of Morocco's ancient storytelling tradition. For nearly a thousand years, storytellers have gathered in the Jemaa el Fna, the legendary square of the city, to recount ancient folktales and fables to rapt audiences. But this unique chain of oral tradition that has passed seamlessly from generation to generation is teetering on the brink of extinction. The competing distractions of television, movies and the internet have drawn the crowds away from the storytellers and few have the desire to learn the stories and continue their legacy. Richard Hamilton has witnessed at first hand the death throes of this rich and captivating tradition and, in the labyrinth of the Marrakech medina, has tracked down the last few remaining storytellers, recording stories that are replete with the mysteries and beauty of the Maghreb.<p></p></p><p>Richard Hamilton has worked for the BBC World Service as a broadcast journalist since 1998, including being a correspondent in Morocco, South Africa and Madagascar. He also reports for BBC TV, radio and online. While living in Morocco, he co-authored the Time Out Guide to Marrakech and has written throughout his career for magazines and newspapers such as Conde Nast Traveller and The Times. He has an MA in African Studies from SOAS.<p></p>'The Last Storytellers succeeds brilliantly in delving down through the endless overlapping layers of Marrakech life, to reveal the extraordinary underbelly, an ancient cultural bedrock built on stories and story-telling. Through a shrewd perception of a society that can seem nothing less than baffling to the Occidental mind, Richard Hamilton has triumphed where many before him have failed.' &#x2013; Tahir Shah, author of The Caliph's House and In Arabian Nights<br><br>'This is a wonderfully vivid and striking collection of stories which I heartily recommend.' &#x2013; Fergal Keane<br><br>'Richard Hamilton has recorded something which very few foreign correspondents do and in doing so he has captured a rich, vibrant yet disappearing world. The immediate and sudden stories of political upheaval, conflict and natural disaster are what takes a foreign correspondent to postings around the world. But instead, Richard Hamilton, a modern reporter of the 24 hour news age, has chosen to focus on something very different. He has listened, learned and been captivated by the storytellers of Morroco, re-telling some of that country's charming and spellbinding traditional stories. The tales are amusing, whimsical and and leave you spellbound that you are reading stories which may soon disappear. Hamilton has paid a fine and lasting tribute to Morocco's storytellers by writing down their stories for posterity....and our enjoyment.' &#x2013; Rageh Omaar<br>'In collecting these tales of wisdom, wonder, adventure and humour from the small and ageing group of Moroccan story -tellers Richard Hamilton has not only offered entertainment to his readers but he has also carried out a valuable form of rescue archaeology within the vanishing world of professional story-telling.' &#x2013; Robert Irwin<br><br>'Charming, fantastical and lively collection..

In the author's note, Nikola-Lisa writes that he was struck by the cyclical nature of her visual record and has arranged this picture book seasonally, starting with spring. Each double-page spread includes a full-color painting on the right, accompanied by the author's brief commentary. Related excerpts from Moses's memoirs are printed in sepia ovals on a cream background on the left. Her words inform older readers about the routines, pleasures, and disappointments of her childhood farm life while the author's text offers a starting point for looking at the pictures with young children. The paintings convey a quiet joy, an ever-changing light, and the beauty of nature (the artist's own brand of pointillism is quite effective at depicting snow, sheer curtains, and tiny buds). An opening color photograph of Moses at her painting table speaks volumes. Nikola-Lisa's careful selections and spare approach effectively convey the spirit of this self-taught, spirited woman.

The second Pimpernel book written by Orczy, it comes chronologically third in the series, after Sir Percy Leads the Band and before The Elusive Pimpernel.</p><p>Baroness Orczy was born in Hungary in 1865, the daughter of Baron Felix Orczy, a landed aristocrat and well-known composer and conductor. She moved with her parents from Budapest to Brussels and then Paris, where she was educated. Orczy also studied art in London and exhibited work at the Royal Academy. Later sheMontagu Barstow and together they worked as illustrators and jointly published an edition of Hungarian folk tales. Fame came in1905 with the publication of The Scarlet Pimpernel, which was originally a play co-written with her husband. Its background of Revolution in France and swashbuckling hero, &#39;Sir Percy Blakeney&#39;, was to prove immensely popular. Sequels followed and many years later film and TV versions are enduringly popular, with new productions from time to time. However, Orczy also wrote detective stories which have a following today amongst those interested in the genre. She died in 1947.Published in 1906, this tale of high romance and intrigue, set during the bloodiest days of the French Revolution, is the first of several sequels to The Scarlet Pimpernel. It has aged well. Johanna Ward is fun to listen to. She puts the author&#39;s rather melodramatic prose in the best possible light by reading with restraint, gravity and authority. She also renders fluently the frequent names and phrases in French. Although character voices are not highly differentiated, it&#39;s always clear who&#39;s speaking and how he or she feels. Good production values top off the welcome reappearance of an old friend. J.N.

Biodynamic craniosacral therapy aims to resolve the trapped forces that underlie and drive these trauma-based patterns of disease and suffering in body and mind. <i>Wisdom in the Body</i> teaches practitioners to develop the finely tuned skills of hands-on palpation and perception to sense the body&#x2019;s subtle rhythms and patterns of inertia or congestion, with the goal of ending trauma and facilitating the expression of the breath of life. A comprehensive introduction to this practice, the book draws on the insights of pioneers like Drs. W. G. Sutherland and Franklyn Sills to explain the key principles about the body&#x2019;s natural intention to heal and how this capability can be encouraged. A valuable resource for students, practitioners, and the lay reader, the book also includes a foreword by Dr. Franklyn Sills.</p><p>Michael Kern, D.O., R.C.S.T., M.I.Cr.A., N.D., is a craniosacral therapist, osteopath, and naturopath.

He lives in an old house built on an Indian mound in Pineland, Florida.*Starred Review* Now in its eleventh episode, White's Doc Ford series, starring Sanibel Island marine biologist and veteran special-ops agent Doc Ford, can always be counted on for an entertaining mix of character interplay and straight-ahead action adventure. This time the dial shifts a bit toward the character side of the scale, as Ford revisits various people and issues from his not-quite-past life as a covert operative. The catalyst for all this stock-taking is the kidnapping of the son Ford only recently learned he had and the resurfacing of Pilar, the boy's mother and the great love of Ford's life. The kidnapping plot, in which Ford, with the help of hippie pal Tomlinson, must rescue his son from a serious psycho who likes to burn people, keeps the suspense churning, but the real focus here--for longtime series followers, at least--is on what this latest crisis means to Ford's life with the people he cares about: his son, girlfriend Dewey, the troubled Pilar, and especially Tomlinson, who has his own dark past. As always in White's work, the various bodies of water that surround and intersect Florida take on the multidimensional qualities of fully developed characters, adding not only atmosphere but also context to Ford's ongoing struggle to achieve in his human relationships the sense of equilibrium he has found in the natural world. He's not there yet, but for the reader at least, that's good news: this story is a long way from over. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Edgar Allan Poe has become strongly associated with the dark nature of his work that, in some minds, it&#39;s as if he became the central character--rather than the author--of the many horror and mystery tales that bear his name. Over a century after Poe&#39;s death, his story remains as fascinating as those he wove, largely because the shadow cast by Poe was not one of his own design.</p><p></p><h2>The Eternal Darkness</h2><p><p>Until a few decades ago, the ocean depths were almost as mysterious and inaccessible as outer space. Oceans cover two-thirds of the earth's surface with an average depth of more than two miles--yet humans had never ventured more than a few hundred feet below the waves. One of the great scientific and archaeological feats of our time has been finally to cast light on the "eternal darkness" of the deep sea. This is the story of that achievement, told by the man who has done more than any other to make it possible: Robert Ballard.</p><br><p> Ballard discovered the wreck of the Titanic. He led the teams that discovered hydrothermal vents and "black smokers"--cracks in the ocean floor where springs of superheated water support some of the strangest life-forms on the planet. He was a diver on the team that explored the mid-Atlantic ridge for the first time, confirming the theory of plate tectonics. Today, using a nuclear submarine from the U.S. Navy, he's exploring the ancient trade routes of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea for the remains of historic vessels and their cargo. In this book, he combines science, history, spectacular illustrations, and first-hand stories from his own expeditions in a uniquely personal account of how twentieth-century explorers have pushed back the frontiers of technology to take us into the midst of a world we could once only guess at.</p><br><p> Ballard begins in 1930 with William Beebe and Otis Barton, pioneers of the ocean depths who made the world's first deep-sea dives in a cramped steel sphere. He introduces us to Auguste and Jacques Piccard, whose "Bathyscaph"descended in 1960 to the lowest point on the ocean floor. He reviews the celebrated advances made by Jacques Cousteau. He describes his own major discoveries--from sea-floor spreading to black smokers--as well as his technical breakthroughs, including the development of remote-operated underwater vehicles and the revolutionary search techniques that led to the discovery and exploration of the Titanic, the Nazi battleship Bismarck, ancient trading vessels, and other great ships.</p><br><p> Readers will come away with a richer understanding of history, earth science, biology, and marine technology--and a new appreciation for the remarkable men and women who have explored some of the most remote and fascinating places on the planet.</p></p><p>As a young man, at a time when most of his peers were turning their eyes to deep space, Robert Ballard came under the spell both of scientific inquiry and of the ocean. After taking a doctorate in marine geology and geophysics, he spent three decades at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, through which he participated in more than a hundred deep-sea expeditions. Writing from the point of view of "a privileged witness to a fascinating burst of exploration," Ballard recounts many of those explorations, including the first up-close studies of the great mid-ocean ridge of volcanic mountains that circles the globe, full of seafloor vents and "black smokers." Along the way Ballard provides a brief history of modern oceanography, looking at the contributions of such scientists as Charles William Beebe and Otis Barton, whose legendary dives in the early 1930s paved the way for much subsequent research. Ballard's narrative takes on particular vigor when he describes, in fascinating detail, his team's search for the wreckage of the <i>Titanic</i>--a search that relied on intelligent guesswork as much as on hard evidence. The methods he and his colleagues used--employing, among other things, sophisticated remote-control craft--to find the unfortunate vessel ushered in a new era of deep-ocean research, a contribution in which Ballard takes justified pride. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><p>"Bob Ballard, building on the early work of Jacques Cousteau, is the preeminent pioneer in truly deep sea exploration and here is the fascinating, gripping story that only he is qualified to tell."--<b>Walter Cronkite</b></p><p>"Bob Ballards <i>The Eternal Darkness</i> chronicles the exciting 20th-century advances in underwater technology, many of them his own. Their contributions to deep ocean knowledge, exploration, discovery, salvage, and natural resource utilization have forever changed the way we view and understand our planet's oceans, and will, in the future, change the way we care for our seas. Ballard now joins Cousteau as another inspired visionary."--<b>Scott Carpenter</b></p><p>"Bob Ballard is a tenacious explorer of the deep ocean and discoverer of ancient sea treasures. Two thousand years ago no trains, planes, or automobiles existed. Most transportation was by sea. Important knowledge of the past can only be uncovered from where it lies, buried in the ocean floor. Bob exhibits his fascination with the unknown by uncovering history that lies at the bottom of the sea floor that is critical to our understanding of the ancient world."--<b>Jean-Michel Cousteau</b></p><p>"Ballard is one of the great explorers of the age. He is not only a great explorer, but a gifted story-teller and an evangelist for science. His joy and contagious excitement in exploration and science have captured the imagination of thousands of students, and rescuing them from dull science teachers, has converted them to pursuing careers in scientific discovery. Now in <i>The Eternal Darkness</i> he draws on all his talent, and his hair-raising experiences, to capture the rest of us in a great adventurous read."--<b>John F. Lehman</b></p><p>"While making some of the most significant discoveries of all time, from finding the <i>Titanic</i> to exposing the geophysical processes that cause oceans to form and continents to move, explorer-scientist Robert Ballard has lived adventures that combine the best of scientific research and Indiana Jones. Bristling with suspense and laced with wry humor, <i>The Eternal Darkness</i> will captivate even the most seasoned landlubber."--<b>Sylvia A. Earle</b></p><p>"Ballard's perspective on specific events in the history of deep-sea explorations is fresh and exciting. This is an important record of the remarkable progression in technology from extremely primitive underwater diving bells to a multiplicity of manned and unmanned systems enabling human presence in the deep ocean."--<b>J. Frederick Grassle, Rutgers University</b></p></p><h2>A Midsummer&#39;s Equation: A Detective Galileo Mystery (Detective Galileo Series, 3)</h2><p><p>Manabu Yukawa, the physicist known as "Detective Galileo," has traveled to Hari Cove, a once-popular summer resort town that has fallen on hard times. He is there to speak at a conference on a planned underwater mining operation, which has sharply divided the town. One faction is against the proposed operation, concerned about the environmental impact on the area, known for its pristine waters. The other faction, seeing no future in the town as it is, believes its only hope lies in the development project. </p><p>The night after the tense panel discussion, one of the resort's guests is found dead on the seashore at the base of the local cliffs. The local police at first believe it was a simple accident-that he wandered over the edge while walking on unfamiliar territory in the middle of the night. But when they discover that the victim was a former policeman and that the cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning, they begin to suspect he was murdered, and his body tossed off the cliff to misdirect the police. </p><p>As the police try to uncover where Tsukahara was killed and why, Yukawa finds himself enmeshed in yet another confounding case of murder. In a series of twists as complex and surprising as any in Higashino's brilliant, critically acclaimed work, Galileo uncovers the hidden relationship behind the tragic events that led to this murder.</p></p><p>KEIGO HIGASHINO is the most widely read author in Japan, with hundreds of millions of copies of his books sold worldwide, and nearly twenty films and television series based on his work.

In this second volume, the focus is the human body as a carrier of deep psychological insights and sacred meanings. <br><br>Whether idolized or abused, the body is the object of much fascinated attention, even obsessive preoccupation, in the contemporary Western world. What has been missing from our culture's preoccupation is an appreciation of the body's organs as symbols of the deepest contents of the human psyche. This book surveys the richness of meaning found in a wide range of beautiful sacred images from the world's traditions and explains what the symbolism of our physical form teaches us about the inner realities of our consciousness, spirit, and divine essence.</p><p>George R. Elder, PhD, is a historian of religions trained in Christian studies at Union Theological Seminary and in Buddhist studies at Columbia University. He was a professor for many years at Hunter College, City University of New York, and is the author of numerous scholarly essays. Dr. Elder is currently National Editor of ARAS and a Jungian counselor.This is an astonishing book, an important publishing event and a significant sourcebook of body wisdom. Developed from the resources in the Archive for Research in Archetypal Symbolism, this is a richly collaborative volume, the product of years of research and thoughtful encounter by members of the Archive. While volume one was organized around the mythic themes that follow the solar calendar from cosmos and creation to death, transformation and rebirth, this second volume focuses on the human body as the locus of the sacred and as the source of deep psychological insights. Each topic is presented in a four-page unit consisting of a full-page color illustration of an art work which captures the archetype, an art-historical discussion of the artifact, an archetypal commentary and a brief bibliography. The odd element of this structure is that the art-historical commentary on the artifact is given equal status to the archetypal commentary. As a result, the archetypal discussion is not as rich as it might be, for the archetypal commentaries do not connect the present iteration of the archetypes with past incarnations. Nevertheless, this enormously useful reference book will be a welcome addition to the scholar's library. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Baked: New Frontiers in Baking</h2><p>As featured on <i>The Martha Stewart Show</i> and <i>The Today Show</i> and in <i>People Magazine</i>!&nbsp;<p></p>Hip.

You know because the truth fits. I was the only member of my family to lack the gene for numbers, but I do need things to add up. Approaching midlife, I became aware of a darkening feeling&#x2013;was it something heavy on my heart, or was something missing? Grateful as I am for the opportunities I&#x2019;ve had, and especially for the people who came into my life as a result, I couldn&#x2019;t ignore this feeling. I had the impulse to begin a conversation with myself, through writing, as if to see if my fingers could get to the bottom of it. It was a Saturday morning eight or ten years ago when I began following this impulse to find the answers to unformed questions. Skywriting is what I call my personal process of discovery.&#x201d;<br><br>And so begins this beautiful and surprising memoir, in which beloved broadcast journalist Jane Pauley tells a remarkable story of self-discovery and an extraordinary life, from her childhood in the American heartland to her three decades in television.<br><br>Encompassing her beginnings at the local Indianapolis station and her bright debut&#x2013;at age twenty-five on NBC&#x2019;s <i>Today</i> and later on <i>Dateline</i>&#x2013;Pauley forthrightly delves into the ups and downs of a fantastic career. But there is much more to Jane Pauley than just the famous face on TVs. In this memoir, she reveals herself to be a brilliant woman with singular insights. She explores her roots growing up in Indiana and discusses the resiliency of the American family, and addresses with humor and depth a subject very close to her heart: discovering yourself and redefining your strengths at midlife. Striking, moving, candid, and unique, <i>Skywriting</i> explores firsthand the difficulty and the rewards of self-reinvention.<br><br><b><br></b></p><p>JANE PAULEY began her broadcasting career in 1972 at her hometown Indianapolis station, WISH-TV. She joined NBC in 1975 as the first woman ever to co-anchor a weeknight evening newscast at NBC&#x2019;s WMAQ-TV in Chicago. She began her thirteen-year tenure on NBC&#x2019;s <i>Today</i> in 1976. In 1992, NBC News launched the newsmagazine show <i>Dateline NBC</i>, with Pauley as co-anchor. After eleven years, her final appearance aired as the acclaimed special &#x201c;Jane Pauley: Signing Off.&#x201d; She is the host of &#x201c;The Jane Pauley Show.&#x201d;<br><br>Pauley has won many awards, including the Radio-Television News Directors Association&#x2019;s Paul White Award for her lifetime contribution to electronic journalism and their Leonard Zeidenberg First Amendment Award, and the National Press Foundation&#x2019;s Sol Taishoff Award for Excellence in Broadcast Journalism. She lives in New York City.<i>Part I<br><br>OUT OF THE BLUE<br><br>May 2001<br><br></i>The room was nice. Large and sunny. Inviting, almost. The layout was defined by three rectangles. One was an entry large enough<br>to be a vestibule, which lent the space an aura of privacy. Itopened into the principal area, but there was a little niche off to<br>the side&#x2013;so instead of a room with four walls, there were eight, and instead of four corners, there were six, plus the private bath. It gave the room a cozy complexity.<br><br>But the showstoppers were the two large windows facing east and two more facing south, which framed the Fifty-ninth Street Bridge a quarter of a mile or so away&#x2013;the one immortalized by Simon and Garfunkel. It spanned the East River ten floors below.<br><br>New York City would never have a lazy river, would it? This one flows energetically to the south and then turns right around and flows to the north. . . . All day long it goes back and forth, back and forth, with the big Atlantic Ocean tides. Fast, but still not too fast for the ferries, which roar back and forth, insensible to the havoc left in their jumbo wake. Only the little tugboats go slowly&#x2013;nudging enormous tankers through a narrow strip of commerce that never gets snarled like the three lanes of traffic heading south on the FDR Drive. It&#x2019;s just the opposite of the song: The lanes heading north are on a lower level, so in effect the Bronx is down and the Battery&#x2019;s up. I&#x2019;m smack in midtown, the busiest place on earth&#x2013;rush hour is every hour of the day, and sometimes the night.<br><br>And, of course, the sun moves around a lot, too, rising over Randalls Island with my breakfast, then climbing higher and higher. For lunch, it turns toward the Chrysler Building, and then down and out of sight. Every day. But I&#x2019;m not going anywhere.<br><br>This was my home for three weeks in the spring of 2001.<br><br>My tides were fluctuating, too&#x2013;back and forth, back and forth&#x2013;sometimes so fast they seemed to be spinning. They call this &#x201c;rapid cycling.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a marvel that a person can appear to be standing still when the mood tides are sloshing back and forth, sometimes sweeping in both directions at once. They call that a<br>&#x201c;mixed state.&#x201d; It felt like a miniature motocross race going on in my head. It made a little hum, and my eyes sort of burned and felt a little too large for their sockets.<br><br>But it was a lovely room. When I checked in, late in May, I was lucky to get it. Evidently there were no other VIPs in residence at that time&#x2013;not at this address, at least. I was allowed to bypass the usual chaos at admitting, a nod to my potential to be recognized, and though technically I was a patient at Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, I was installed in a room on a general floor, another nod to my singularity. I never saw it, but I heard that the other<br>floor had locked doors, that psychiatric patients were supposed to wear hospital gowns rather than the fancy pajamas I was given liberty to wear.<br><br>The special attention and fine accommodations had not been at my request, nor was I here because I wanted to show off my nice pj&#x2019;s. I was here because they said I ought to be&#x2013;I accepted that much&#x2013;and had come, under my own steam, for a few days.<br><br>I became accustomed to mealtime trays with plastic utensils and no knives, to leaving the bathroom door open at least a crack, to sleeping with a lady in white sitting six feet away in the darkness, keeping an eye on me. No hands under the covers, she said on my first night away from home, which made me cry&#x2013;acutely aware of where I was and why. I cried a little harder.<br><br>In time, my lovely, sunny room, with African violets thriving under my personal care in the morning light, came to feel like home. And I had to wear pajamas only at night&#x2013;sweats and T-shirts seemed perfectly appropriate for casual entertaining in my room with a view.<br><i><br><br>March 1999<br></i><br>Hives: I used to call them the seven-year itch, because they had first appeared when I was seven, then again at fourteen and, briefly, again when I was twenty-one. That last time, just before I finished college, everyone had a case of nerves: My roommates were either hyperventilating, suffering migraines, or getting married. When I was twenty-eight&#x2013;at the next seven-year interval&#x2013;the hives were silent and, I thought, gone for good.<br><br>Out of the blue, in March 1999, while I was on vacation with my family and six months shy of my forty-ninth birthday, my unwelcome friends came back for the first time in my adult life and settled. I didn&#x2019;t see them every day, but often enough that any day they could show up for no reason. These were not red,<br>patchy, itchy everyday hives; mine involved soft-tissue swelling in odd places such as the pads of my fingers and feet or the pressure point from a bracelet, but most typically on an upper eyelid or my lips&#x2013;places most incompatible with a career on camera.<br><br>That would be the least of it.<br>Chronic recurrent idiopathic urticaria edema is the full name&#x2013;a diagnosis more worthy of all the attention. After I first spoke publicly about it, scores of people wrote to me, thinking&#x2013;mistakenly&#x2013;that, being a TV personality, Jane Pauley would have been given the cure. I had not. But for me, as it turned out, the treatment was far worse than the disease.<br><i><br><br>April 2000<br></i><br>&#x201c;We have to smack them down!&#x201d; my doctor had said after my first trip to the ER. Steroids were the weapons of choice&#x2013;the antiinflammatory kind, not the bodybuilding kind, but it felt like a heavy dose of testosterone nonetheless. It was not a decision made lightly; these are powerful drugs that have to be taken in slowly increasing increments over a period of weeks. Tapering off is done in similar increments. The steroids had the desired effect&#x2013;the hives subsided&#x2013;but as a side effect of the drugs, I was revved!<br><br>I was so energized that I didn&#x2019;t just walk down the hall, I felt like I was motoring down the hall. I was suddenly the equal of my high-energy friends who move fast and talk fast and loud. I told everyone that I could understand why men felt like they could run the world, because I felt like that. This was a new me, and I liked her!<br><br>Earlier that spring, I had had a modest idea for a voter registration drive at New York City&#x2019;s High School for Leadership and Public Service, where I was &#x201c;principal for a day.&#x201d; The faculty, staff, and kids ran with the idea&#x2013;fifty-two students were added to the voter rolls at lunchtime in the cafeteria. It was very moving.<br><br>Later, I was back at the same high school, with a bigger idea. After weeks of steroids, I had a more ambitious agenda&#x2013;a ramped-up voter registration drive. It would be like the first one, but instead of confining the drive to the cafeteria, I said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do it citywide!&#x201d; Two thousand New York City school kids were registered before school was out.<br><i><br><br>May&#x2014;June 2000<br></i><br>It was nearly midnight, and I could see the flashing lights approaching our apartment building from two blocks away&#x2013;a fire truck and an ambulance. I was both relieved and embarrassed. My throat was swelling up. My doctor had suggested I call 911 instead of looking for a taxi to the hospital. I had called 911, but I didn&#x2019;t anticipate a convoy.<br><br>Before long, the doorbell rang and I went to answer it, finding two paramedics&#x2013;a Hispanic woman and a black man, both middle-aged and experienced-looking&#x2013;standing at the door with two very big bags, ready to save a life.<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the patient?&#x201d; they asked.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; I said sheepishly. Any kind of swelling that involves air passageways, I&#x2019;ve learned, is taken pretty seriously by doctors. It has the potential to be life-threatening. But at that moment, with the flashing lights and the vehicles double-parked outside, somehow &#x201c;potential&#x201d; didn&#x2019;t justify the response.<br><br>One paramedic went straight to the paperwork. The other tied off my upper arm and took a vial of blood. She apologized as she inserted a plastic tube in a vein. At first it burned, and a stinging sensation raced all the way up my arm and flooded my throat with a sudden heat. Warmth filled my belly, and I felt safe in the competent hands of this experienced team. But on the ride in the ambulance I was aware that most people strapped in that gurney aren&#x2019;t feeling as comfy-cozy as I was. When we arrived at the hospital, I saw three uniformed paramedics rush to the door, and all I could think was how preposterous it was: &#x201c;Make way! Make way! HIVES!&#x201d;<br>� � �<br>The steroids worked, until I stopped taking them. So I started a second round, and by June they were smacking me down! Instead of feeling powerful, I was just irritable. Instead of motoring me down the hall, my engine was just revving. I was going nowhere. It was hard to work, and I was exhausted. <i>Dateline </i>executive producer Neal Shapiro gave me two weeks to chill out and relax. I told a colleague that when I came back I wouldn&#x2019;t be talking so loud. I barely worked during the summer of 2000.<br><br>The hives came and went, but that was incidental to the depression I could feel gathering around me. At the end of the summer, I was sent to a sychopharmacologist. He prescribed a low-dose antidepressant and promised that I&#x2019;d feel better &#x201c;in weeks.&#x201d; When I didn&#x2019;t, he said, &#x201c;Well, certainly by Thanksgiving.&#x201d; After that, he stopped making promises.

How about growing up in 1980s Newfoundland, which--as Mark Critch will tell you--was more like the 1960s. Take a trip to where it all began in this funny and warm look back on his formative years.<br><br>Here we find a young Mark trick-or-treating at a used car lot, getting locked out of school on a fourth-floor window ledge, faking an asthma attack to avoid being arrested by military police, trying to buy beer from an untrustworthy cab driver, shocking his parents by appearing naked onstage--and much more. <br><br>Best known as the "roving reporter" for CBC's This Hour Has 22 Minutes, Mark Critch has photo-bombed Justin Trudeau, interviewed Great Big Sea's Alan Doyle (while impersonating Alan Doyle), offered Pamela Anderson a million dollars to stop acting, and crashed White House briefings.

He is the host of CBC's Halifax Comedy Festival and has written for and appeared in CBC's world-renowned <i>Just for Laughs</i> series.The first thing I remember is drowning.<br><br> My mother had taken me swimming at what Newfoundlanders call &#x201c;the beach.&#x201d; This is not what the average person would imagine when they picture a beach. There is no golden sand. Emerald water does not dance along the shoreline. Bronzed and toned bodies do not lounge on beach blankets, hiding flirtatious glances under designer sunglasses.<br><br> This is not what the Beach Boys sang about. This is more like a beach in the &#x201c;Allied troop carriers landed on the beaches of Normandy despite the poor weather conditions&#x201d; sense. In fact, most of my childhood memories seem like black-and-white war footage. The sky is always grey. There&#x2019;s a lot of shaking and someone is always yelling, &#x201c;Move! Move! Move!&#x201d;<br><br> When you&#x2019;re walking on a Newfoundland beach you have to keep an eye out for any large rocks you might accidentally step on. It&#x2019;s difficult because the large rocks are usually hidden under thousands of smaller, sharper rocks. If you&#x2019;re lucky you can avoid them by hopping from broken beer bottles to broken pop bottles, tacking left and right around the dozens of pale white bodies lying back to sunbathe and rub their bleeding feet. A Newfoundland sunbather is a sight to behold. It&#x2019;s best to use protective eyewear. Directly looking at a Newfoundland sunbather can result in snow blindness. I myself am so pale that my skin takes on an almost translucent appearance. It&#x2019;s known that Newfoundlanders have big hearts. We know this because on the beach you can actually see them beating through our pale skin. Imagine a jellyfish that has somehow swallowed a large fish and chips.<br><br> Keep in mind that these people have chosen to swim in the North Atlantic. This is the water the <i>Titanic</i> sunk in. Remember the scene in the movie where Rose is floating on the door and Jack, his hair streaked with icicles, slips below the frigid water into the darkness? Same water. Consider that these are the same beaches that blue whales wash up onto as they die. This is where the largest creatures on earth decide to commit suicide. And yet wave after wave of doughy, cadaverous swimmers playfully dive in and say, &#x201c;Water&#x2019;s not so bad today! I can feel my legs!&#x201d;<br><br> Now back to drowning. It actually wasn&#x2019;t the cold water that almost got me. Nor was it the powerful Labrador current that drags icebergs down from the Arctic. No, it was something much more dangerous. It was that all-consuming, ever-present Newfoundland danger: conversation.<br> I was three years old and in awe of the sights and sounds. Up until this point, I had led a fairly sheltered life. I grew up about five kilometres from anything. My father was a newsman at VOCM radio in St. John&#x2019;s. He tried valiantly to fill small-town news with big-city excitement. A typical Mike Critch news report would go:<br><br> <i>Late last night, early this morning, a moose was struck on the Trans-Canada Highway. The sex of the moose has not yet been released. Two men were killed, one seriously. Mike Critch for the VOCM news service.</i><br><br> We lived next to the radio station, which was next to a four-lane highway that led into the Trans-Canada. My early childhood was like the first level of the video game Frogger. And there were no other children for miles. The closest thing to other kids for me to play with were the used car salesmen in their plaid suits at the lots down the road.<br><br> Halloween was a lonely time. I was a sad sight walking along the Trans-Canada in my plastic C-3PO costume from Woolco. Not that you&#x2019;d know I even wore a costume under the snowsuit I had to wear to protect me from the snowdrifts along the highway.<br><br> Little Me: Trick or Treat.<br><br> Used Car Salesman: Hey, Mark, what are you supposed to be? A robot in a snowsuit?<br><br> Little Me: Something like that.<br><br> Used Car Salesman: You&#x2019;re a weird kid. Look, I don&#x2019;t got no candy. How about a pack of Halls and a handful of Rothman&#x2019;s?<br><br> Little Me: Sounds good.<br><br> I once thought for a moment that I&#x2019;d seen another child, but he turned out to be a midget wrestler who went by the name &#x201c;Little Beaver.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d come to the station to promote a wrestling match. He had a Mohawk, wore a three-piece suit, and smoked a cigar that was almost as big as he was. I thought, &#x201c;That is the toughest kid I have ever seen.&#x201d; But now, here among the rocks of the beach, there were more kids than I&#x2019;d ever seen before. Half of them seemed tough enough to last a round or two with Little Beaver, but even still, I was drawn to them. My mother, on the other hand, was drawn into a conversation. That was not hard to do. My father worked at a radio station. My mother was a radio station. She was a news-gathering machine who could spit out gossip at a machine-gun pace. To engage my mother in conversation was to face a barrage of gossip-loaded ammunition.<br><br> Stranger: How are you today, ma&#x2019;am?<br><br> Mom: OhI&#x2019;mGood. Yes,HowAreYouNow,MyDear?

MyGod,SomeShockin&#x2019;.<br><br> Stranger: Do you want fries with that?<br><br> My mother had noticed someone she thought might look like someone she thought she knew, and that was enough for her to risk the death-defying journey over the jagged rocks in search of information. I was left to follow the siren call of the ocean and the children being tossed on the waves like seagulls waiting out a storm.<br><br> I started to walk directly into the water. The cold didn&#x2019;t affect me. I was a husky child with a good layer of heat-protective blubber around me. I was made for this. The water came up to my knees and I walked on. It came up to my navel and forward I marched. Then I felt the strangest sensation. The rocks beneath my feet had given way to sand. It felt glorious. Smooth, soft, and grainy. It reminded me of the few moments of barefoot wonder I&#x2019;d experienced standing in the cat&#x2019;s litter box before my mother told me to &#x201c;GetOutOfThatNowBeforeISkinsYa! ForGodSakes,B&#x2019;y,TheCat&#x2019;sArseWasInThat!&#x201d;<br><br> I looked over at the children, watching them frolic, and wondered, &#x201c;How can I be a part of that?&#x201d; Surely they would notice me and ask me to play with them, like kids did on <i>Sesame Street</i>? We&#x2019;d sing some song about &#x201c;the letter C&#x201d; or something. Maybe they&#x2019;d like some Halls or some Rothman&#x2019;s? All I had to do was wait.<br><br> I remember looking up at a cliff and seeing the Newfoundland flag. Not the red, blue, and gold flag designed by the famous artist Christopher Pratt. No, I mean the true Newfoundland flag: a plastic grocery bag caught in a tree. Then my gaze shifted to two kids, a boy and girl floating by in a tire. They sat on it, their feet dangling into the water through the centre. It looked like everything that childhood should be. I continued on. The water came up to my neck. The children on the tire laughed together as they spun lazily. I stepped closer, hypnotized by their joy.<br> The water slipped over my head. I didn&#x2019;t realize that the ground was on a slope. I&#x2019;d never been in deep water before and assumed I could just keep walking.<br><br> I&#x2019;d never thought about breathing until that moment. I remember thinking, &#x201c;Oh, right. I have to breathe.&#x201d; Try as I might, I couldn&#x2019;t get my head above the water. I looked back to shore and could just barely make out the image of my mother interrogating a couple about their exact lineage. Nobody knew I was there. I kept going.<br><br> With every step I took, I could feel a great weight pressing down inside me. I was walking farther but going deeper. I looked up, confused. I caught sight of the tire children. They were floating above me, still laughing. I reached for a pink Minnie Mouse sandal on the surface, just over my head. With the strength of a panicked child, I pulled her foot toward me with all my might. Next, I latched on to the Six Million Dollar Man sneaker of the boy. &#x201c;He kept his sneakers on,&#x201d; I thought. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t even know there&#x2019;s sand here. I should tell him to take them off and feel it squish between his toes. That&#x2019;ll be a good ice-breaker.&#x201d;<br><br> I pulled them down. I could feel the panic leave my body and transfer into theirs. I grabbed their tire, sending them splashing into the cold water. Exhausted, I lay on the improvised float like a walrus on a rock and sunned myself. It was nice to have friends my own age.</p><h2>The Mountain Men</h2><p>Profiles fur trappers of the American frontier, describing their hardships, heroism, and contribution to early American civilization</p><p>This history of American fur trappers of the 1820s and 1830s recounts the role men such as Jed Smith, Jim Bridger and others played in the opening of the western United States.<br><b>George Laycock</b> has worked as a full-time author, journalist, and photographer since 1951.

After a difficult labour, Katherine of Aragon, queen consort of England, must have dared to hope that her prayers for a healthy child had, at last, been answered. Katherine did not know that news of her father's death had arrived in London only two days earlier; it was deliberately kept from her so that she could approach her delivery calmly.In the seven years preceding the arrival of this daughter, Katherine had not produced the heir that either her father, Ferdinand of Aragon, or her husband expected of her. She had endured four miscarriages, one stillbirth and the death of an infant son who was not quite two months old. Seven years was a long time for England, a country so notoriously plagued by political upheaval and civil war, to be without an heir. This catalogue of failure had hit hard at the pride of Henry VIII's Spanish wife. Her deep religious faith and the determination she inherited from her parents, Ferdinand and his formidable wife, Isabella of Castile, had taught Katherine how to endure. Nor was Henry her first husband; that had been the doomed Arthur, Prince of Wales, Henry VIII's elder brother, who had left her a young widow in 1502. But in 1516 all the suffering ofthe past evaporated, at least temporarily, in the joyful realisation that she and Henry were, at last, parents.The king's undoubted relief was evident. And any regrets about the baby's sex were disguised as optimism for the future. 'We are still young,' Henry told the Venetian ambassador, whose mingled congratulations and commiserations on the birth of a daughter evidently pricked him.1 He expressed his confidence that, with God's will, sons would follow. But, at 31, Katherine was nearly six years older than her husband, and her gynaecological history was discouraging. What she privately thought of her chances we do not know but it was evident from the outset that she saw her daughter as England's heir.Katherine and Henry were well matched intellectually. They had both received the benefits of an education by the leading humanists of Europe, at a time when learning was considered an essential part of the preparation for leadership among royal families. Both were the children of royal houses that had teetered before establishing themselves and there was a distant bond of consanguinity, going back to the marriage of John of Gaunt with Constance of Castile. They had known each other since Henry was ten and Katherine 15, when he had escorted her down the aisle at her first wedding. But, in 1516, the fact that Katherine had been his dead brother's wife was never mentioned.Physically and temperamentally, however, the couple were completely different. Katherine had been a personable young woman, petite and slim. But years of pregnancies had now given her a figure that could optimistically be described as matronly. Her husband's French rival, Francis I, ungallantly described her as old and deformed, by which he meant that she was fat. After the birth of her daughter, she grew even fatter. On state occasions, resplendent in cloth of gold or silver and weighed down by expensive stones, she certainly had all the trappings of a queen, even if she did resemble a stout jewellery chest. She had always been a pious woman and still kept Spanish priests in her household. No one minded. Londoners, in particular, loved Katherine and her devotion to religion in her daily life was greatly admired.That Henry no longer found her attractive is not surprising. But he respected her and she was still a force in politics, especially foreign affairs. In the first years of his reign she guided him through the turbulent waters of international diplomacy, with the dual aim of supporting Spanish interests and shaping her young husband as a serious force in Europe. She was an effective and energetic regent during theFranco-Scottish wars of 1513. Henry probably knew what he owed her, though he may not have acknowledged it.Yet apart from a commitment to their regal responsibilities, they never had much in common. Henry's main pastime was sport.A tall and imposing figure at this stage of his life, Henry was a prince in his prime, handsome, gallant, a king to admire and revere. Katherine adored him and would do so until the day she died. He gave every appearance (and the appearance may have been misleading) of preferring the field and the joust to government. His personal favourites were bear-like men of little brain, such as Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, who had daringly married Henry's sister, Mary, without royal permission. He got away with it, and they continued to wrestle and ride in the lists, to hunt and backslap and enjoy the physicality of life. And while Henry was pursuing boar and deer in southern England, Katherine visited shrines, made offerings and prayed. Religious tourism was common in the early 16th century and it was one of the queen's major recreations. It also made her visible and popular.Henry was an extrovert who loved music and public display. Katherine dutifully sat beside him and looked gracious, but her mind was increasingly elsewhere. Until 1516 she had played the role of consort with great aplomb, but her body had let her down. She could conceive easily but not bear healthy children. If she thought God was displeased, she kept her fears to herself and she turned, more and more, to religion. On that winter's day in the red-brick palace of Greenwich, it seemed that her devotions had finally been rewarded. It is easy to imagine that she felt that, at last, she had succeeded.The little princess was named Mary, after her aunt, the beautiful and feisty star of Henry's court. Katherine and her sister-in-law were on very good terms and would remain so, but the queen was no doubt pleased at the choice of name for religious as well as family reasons. The child, small but pretty, already showed signs that she had inherited the red-gold hair of both her parents and the clear Tudor complexion. Few royal children can have been so longed for and so privileged. Her grandparents had been the foremost monarchs in Europe and her father was the epitome of a Renaissance prince. At the very least, she could expect to make an impressive marriage in Europe. If no son was born to Henry and Katherine, her future would be even grander. She would rule as England's first sovereign queen.This was a glorious prospect, but not necessarily an enviable one. Mary was born into a turbulent Europe, where even the great floweringof art, literature, music and thought that characterised the Renaissance could not disguise the harsh nature of political realities. The balance of power might change but warfare was not just endemic, it was a prized way of life for the aristocracy. Europeans faced an existence that, for most, was indeed brutal and short. Recurring bouts of pestilence swept over the continent, decimating populations often weakened by famine. In 1485, the year of the accession of Mary's grandfather, Henry VII, England suffered its first outbreak of the sweating sickness, a type of virulent influenza that tended to be more prevalent in the warmer months. It struck swiftly and with frightening effect, killing seemingly healthy people in the space of 24 hours. By the time of Mary's birth the sweat, as it was known, was well established as an annual hazard. Just as deadly as the spectre of disease were the vagaries of the weather. Drought and flood ruined harvests, bringing further misery, and even the rich and high born, with more mobility and better diets, could not be sure of survival. Henry VIII spent every summer evading sickness by moving around the south of England, keeping well clear of London. His success in this respect did not make him less of a hypochondriac.2In a Europe where life was so uncertain, the needs of the dead naturally occupied the minds of those who survived. The existence of God and the survival of the soul coloured the daily lives of everyone, from king to poorest peasant. Prayer was the means by which the living could intercede for departed loved ones, shortening their time in purgatory and eventually freeing them, it was hoped, from the torments of hell. These abstractions were absolute certainties for 16th-century people, for whom religion was as much a part of everyday existence as breathing and sleeping. But by the second decade of the century, there were many concerns about the role of the religious establishment that governed the earthly structure of religion. One minor aspect that would shortly acquire an unexpected significance was irritation at the idea that the soul could be speeded to its repose by the purchase of indulgences. This appealed to the gullible or just the plain lazy-prayer and Church ceremonial took up a lot of time-and it appealed to the Church's accountants even more. Everywhere, the power of the Church was evident and resented. The early 16th-century popes ran an enormously wealthy-and equally worldly-business enterprise. The Vatican was a byword for double-dealing, promiscuity and greed. Even the most devout sadly recognised that Rome was full of bankers and whores. As war leaders, the popes stood shoulder to shoulder with the kings of Europe and weredetermined, wherever possible, to profit from the conflicts that they so happily embraced.But these failings and uncertainties were nothing new and they did not dent the enthusiasm of the rich and powerful in Europe for the good things of the Renaissance. When Mary was born the early artists were beginning to pass. Botticelli had died in 1510 and Leonardo, a refugee from his native Tuscany, died in France when Mary was three. Michelangelo, on the other hand, was at the height of his powers, having completed the Sistine Chapel in 1512. Desiderius Erasmus, the greatest of the humanist thinkers, was thriving in northern Europe, patronised by Mary's father and his fellow-monarchs. In the year before Mary's birth, Thomas More wrote his discourse on the ideal political state, <i>Utopia</i>, ensuring that the credentials of the English as contributors to the new ideas would be taken seriously. Universities throughout the continent thrived.Yet amid this ferment, fundamental questions about the nature of the relationship between the Church and the state, as well as the Church and the individual, had yet to find an effective outlet. Their first serious expression came from an unlikely source, when Mary was just one year old. An Augustinian monk in Germany, besieged by self-doubt and irritated by a friar from a rival order who was flagrantly selling indulgences on his doorstep, decided to raise an academic debate about the obnoxious practice of buying one's way out of sin. His name was Martin Luther. He would change the world, and, with it, the course of Mary's life.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The country into which Mary was born was regarded with varying amounts of condescension by its mainland European neighbours. The barbarity, duplicity and sheer effrontery of the English were often remarked upon. 'Pink, white and quarrelsome' was the splendid description of one group of disgusted Spanish visitors. England was not generally liked or respected in Europe. Ferdinand and Isabella considered it suitable only for their youngest daughter; they were not entirely convinced by the new dynasty's hold on power.When Mary was born, the Tudors had been ruling for only 30 years and Henry VIII's perception that his inheritance was not stable was real and alarming. England throughout Mary's lifetime was a dangerous, violent place, its political life characterised by faction and intrigue. Ambition could as easily bringdeath as power, and in this heated atmosphere men seldom kept their feelings in check. Tudor England was emotionally raw. It was not uncommon for blows to be exchanged in council meetings and Henry VIII himself apparently subjected his ministers to physical abuse. Cardinal Wolsey was known for his bad language; on one occasion he harassed a papal delegation who had come to see him and threatened them physically. Grown men wept readily, sometimes, no doubt, out of fear for their own survival. Ambassadors from France and Spain resident in London agreed on very little, but they both knew that you could not trust an English politician, no matter how much you paid him-and both countries often paid generously. The principled English politician seemed to be a contradiction in terms. Even worse were the general populace, a load of xenophobic drunks who would cut your throat sooner than offer you board and lodging.Mary's Spanish inheritance, on the other hand, though no less violent in some ways, placed her at the centre of the struggle for power in Europe. In understanding Mary herself, this part of her background is often misconstrued. Generations of English historians have been mightily displeased with the fact that Mary was half Spanish, as if this 'impurity' of blood, in contrast to the wholly English credentials of her half-sister, Elizabeth, was some sort of birth defect. Yet, in 16th-century Europe, where dynastic marriages were a vital part of the struggle for power, such a descent would have been viewed as an asset, not a liability. The English kings were unusual in marrying their own countrywomen. This 15th-century habit was a result of a combination of civil war and personal inclinations which had kept them out of the European marriage market, and out of European influence, during the long period between 1445, when Henry VI married Margaret of Anjou, and 1501, when Prince Arthur married Katherine of Aragon. In later life, Mary would find her Spanish ancestry a source of both solace and pride, and she would look to the power of her mother's family to give England a role in Europe that she believed would enhance, rather than detract from, its influence.Ferdinand and Isabella, Mary's grandparents, were, it has been said, the first 'power couple' in early modern Europe.3 Theirs was certainly an effective, if sometimes fraught, alliance. Isabella was a warrior queen, equally ruthless in the pursuit of power and of religious certainty. She saw off the stronger claims of her niece to the throne of Castile with as much single-mindedness as she undertook campaigning in the south ofSpain against the Moors. Her alliance with Ferdinand was politically expedient to both of them but does seem to have been characterised by passion, despite Ferdinand's infidelity. Isabella was a woman of great mental strength and physical determination. The inconvenience of successive pregnancies and a growing family did not stop her spending long months with her armies, much of the time on horseback. She was a woman untroubled by doubt and her narrowly focused vision did not permit her to recognise the damage done to Spanish culture by the destruction of its rich Moorish and Jewish heritage. In an intolerant age, Isabella was a true heir of the Crusaders, and fiercely proud of her achievements. Her portraits show a reserved but determined, almost ascetic woman. It is not hard to imagine her in a nun's habit, but Isabella's service to the Lord was offered outside the cloister, on the battlefields of Spain. Her calmness is evident in her face. She knew that God had given her victory.Nor does she ever seem to have questione...</p><h2>Christmas Ornament Legends: A Collection of Stories, Traditions, and Folklore from the Old World</h2><p>Describes what various ornaments on a Christmas tree represent such as rabbits, coffeepots, bells, pickles and many others;includes color photographs of Old World Christmas Glass ornaments</p><p></p><h2>My Life and Hard Times</h2><p><p>In <i>My Life and Hard Times,</i> Thurber returns to his starting pointthe delightful chaos and frustrations brought on by family, boyhood, youth, odd dogs, and recalcitrant machinery in the quiet university town of his birth.</p><p>This is one of the most deeply humorous books of our century.

Rebels on the Backlot follows six top&#x2013;level film directors from the origins of their careers through the making and release of their signature films. They are: Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights), David Fincher (Fight Club), Steven Soderbergh (Traffic), Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich) and David O. Russell (Three Kings). The book uses the development, writing, shooting, editing and release of each director's major film to explore the lives and struggles each of them faced. It will dip in and out of each filming experience, drawing in the stories of other figures along the way, creating a chronological portrait of contemporary Hollywood and the rebel generation of the 1990s. This is also a story of an emerging community of talented artists &#x2013;&#x2013; directors, writers, actors of young Hollywood &#x2013;&#x2013; who supported each other, burn with envy at one another's success, swap girlfriends and boyfriends and ultimately spur each other to greater accomplishments.</p></p><p><p>Sharon Waxman is a Hollywood correspondent for the <em>New York Times</em> and previously was a correspondent for the <em>Washington Post</em> covering the entertainment industry. She lives in southern California with her family.</p>For a few golden years, a generation ago, Hollywood film directors preened as artists (also known as auteurs, the French word for authors). Then the movie moguls figured out how to make big bucks producing and marketing comic-book blockbusters, and the pretense was over. Most studio directors became faceless functionaries who shouted at actors, "Scream as loud as you can at the blue screen, and the computer guys will put in the monsters later."<p>Most, but not all, says Sharon Waxman in Rebels on the Backlot. A former entertainment reporter for The Washington Post, now with the New York Times, Waxman profiles half-a-dozen young male directors (yes, that gender thing again) who have kept the preening auteur alive even in the corporate kingdoms of contemporary Hollywood, where accountants ride with royalty and artists usually carry the brooms and pans. This Magnificent Six -- Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, David Fincher, Paul Thomas Anderson, David O. Russell and Spike Jonze (Adam Spiegel) -- indeed gave us some of the most thrilling and heartening American works of cinema art during the otherwise generally sour Hollywood movie decade of the '90s.</p><p>Waxman's approach is about halfway divided between her directors' private lives and professional demeanors, on the one hand, and the intricate bluffs and betrayals of movie deal-making, on the other. No one comes out looking good, as is usual in the Hollywood-behind-the-scenes genre. The directors, no matter how much we may admire their work, generally turn out to be raving egomaniacs or social misfits or both, perfectly willing to jettison any friend, wife, lover or family member to climb out of the primordial ooze of the American indie world and make it in the big time. What's sociologically (or perhaps psychoanalytically) interesting about this group is that several of them seem permanently to have ditched their mothers long before they had a foot up on the ladder of success.</p><p>That said, Waxman tells a fast-paced and always absorbing story of how some of the most significant American movies of the era -- "Boogie Nights," "Three Kings" and "Being John Malkovich," to name several -- got written, financed and made. Her book is a triumph of journeywoman legwork. In addition to cadging interviews with her sometimes recalcitrant principals, she has spoken with scores of exes: agents, managers, producers, studio heads, co-workers, all of the aforementioned relations, including the ex-mothers, to craft a rich and detailed if ultimately bleak portrait of the lives of young talent on the make and the games they play. A lot of publicity myths get shattered along the way, such as the oft-repeated story that Spike Jonze is heir to the Spiegel catalog fortune.</p><p>One of Waxman's most compelling accounts details the production of "Three Kings" (1999), a unique major studio film concerning Operation Desert Storm, the first Gulf War, which took on added significance after the 2003 Iraq invasion. Moving from TV to film, George Clooney badly wanted the lead role, and Warner Brothers, which, she writes, "had signed a huge development deal with the actor," badly wanted him in it. But Russell, the director, "hated Clooney's style of acting, which he considered a lot of head-bobbing and mugging for the camera." Although Clooney got the part, the director and star denigrated each other throughout the shoot, and once, Waxman reports, came to physical blows.</p><p> A quarter-century ago Michael Pye and Lynda Myles published a book called The Movie Brats: How the Film Generation Took Over Hollywood, and Waxman might have considered calling her book, in Hollywood sequel fashion, "The Movie Brats II." Some commentators have blamed sex, drugs and rock-and-roll for the fall from grace of the '70s auteurs, rather than changes in movie distribution and marketing. Readers may be relieved (or appalled, or not care either way) to learn from Waxman that sex, drugs and rock-and-roll still play a prominent role in the lives of the '90s auteurs, not necessarily in that order. But the differences between the two generations are instructive.</p><p>The "film generation" of the '70s -- Coppola, Lucas, Scorsese and the rest -- went to film school and became steeped in film history watching Hollywood classics of the '30s and '40s in class and on late-night TV. The new generation of Tarantino and company not only didn't go to film school, they hardly set foot in secondary school. Their classics were '70s films like "Star Wars," which they watched over and over again, hundreds of times, on their VCRs. They made movies less out of some relation to a heritage (leaving aside Tarantino's kung fu legacy) than out of their private demons, which may be one reason, Waxman suggests, why they persevered for months and years in making the movies they wanted to make, rather than capitulating to the crushing weight of the system that she so extensively documents.</p><p>The status of her subjects, Waxman acknowledges, is no less precarious than was that of the original Movie Brats. The fabled "green light" to make a movie is as elusive as the Great Gatsby's at the end of a Long Island dock, and often depends on the intricate game of musical chairs played by corporate bosses seeking to make a name or a statement. But one can at least come away from her book with the satisfaction of knowing that disloyalty, duplicity and bad faith are as rife in the creative precincts of young Hollywood as they are in the fat-cat executive suites.</p><p>Reviewed by Robert Sklar <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

Mystery Guild.</p><p>Nancy Atherton is the bestselling author of eighteen other Aunt Dimity mysteries. The first book in the series, <em>Aunt Dimitys Death</em>, was voted One of the Centurys 100 Favorite Mysteries by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. She lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado.Dimity Westwood is as dead as ever, but she's still on hand- -a reassuring presence whose words appear magically in a blue notebook--to offer counsel and consolation to her legatee Lori Shepherd when fighting breaks out between Dr. Adrian Culver, the Oxford archeologist who's commandeered St. George's schoolhouse for his digging detritus, and village empress Peggy Kitchen, who'd been promised the schoolhouse for the Harvest Festival to put Finch back in touch with its ancient customs. St. George's vicar, Rev. Theodore Bunting, could have Adrian packing in a minute if he could only show him Disappointments in Devling, the pamphlet in which Bunting's Victorian predecessor, Rev. Cornelius Gladwell, confessed to having salted Scrag End field with archaeological artifacts in protest of an earlier dig. But someone has pinched the vicar's copy from his study, so he asks Lori if she can round up another of the only nine copies in existence before the conflict escalates into something worse. No fear. Though Lori, newly delivered of twins, will confront witches and long-buried romances, rumors of ghosts and aliens, nothing will go wrong among the dramatis personae--all of them as carefully matched as the pieces of a good tea service--that can't be mended by Dimity's advice, a little tactful conversation, and some of Sally Pyne's lemonbars. Atherton's placid fourth (Aunt Dimity's Good Deed, 1996, etc.) confirms her status as the coziest cozy of them all.

It is also a genuine self-help book offering clear advice on how to live according to the principles of existentialism formulated by Nietzsche, Sartre, Camus, and the other great existentialist philosophers. An attack on contemporary excuse culture, the book urges us to face the hard existential truths of the human condition. By revealing that we are all inescapably free and responsible - &#39;condemned to be free,&#39; as Sartre says - the book aims to empower the reader with a sharp sense that we are each the master of our own destiny. Cox makes fun of the reputation existentialism has for being gloomy and pessimistic, exposing it for what it really is - an honest, uplifting, and potentially life changing philosophy!</p><p>A concise and humorous introduction to existentialism aimed squarely at a general readership - and available in paperback for the first time.Gary Cox has a PhD in Philosophy from the University of Birmingham, UK, where he is also an Honorary Research Fellow.</p><h2>Puzzle Train (Young Puzzles Series)</h2><p>This book, the latest in the Usborne young p uzzle series, takes the reader on a steam powered journey th rough a puzzle world.

"This is a story about a knight who was dying, and the princess who saved his life," Bach writes in his opening greeting. "It's a story about beauty and beasts and spells and fortresses, about death-powers that seem and life-powers that are." Yes, it is all that, and more. On the earthly plane this is about the riveting love affair between two fully human people who are willing to explore time travel and other dimensions together even as they grapple with the earthly struggles of intimacy, commitment, smothering, and whose turn it is to cook. Their love affair and happy ending inspired many enthusiastic fans. Years later, some of these fans were devastated to discover that this match made in heaven didn't manage to stick (the couple are no longer together). But in an interview, Bach explained that lovers don't have to stay married forever to be lifetime soul mates. Read this as a lesson about love's enchantments and possibilities, but don't count on this book to keep you and your mate on the bridge across forever. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>er felt alone in a world of&nbsp;&nbsp;strangers, missing someone you've never met, you'll find a&nbsp;&nbsp;message from your love in <i>The Bridge&nbsp;&nbsp;Across Forever</i>.</p><h2>Maigret&#39;s Christmas</h2><p>Nine of Simenon&#x2019;s best short stories, beginning with a Christmas mystery in which an otherwise sensible little girl insists that she has seen Father Christmas.

Women especially need to face the witch in themselves to open to the power she embodies. Men facing the witch in themselves must deal with this fearsome power firsthand, no longer blaming women for it. Men need to face the vulnerable feelings behind the clowning masks, and open to the largeness and range of life they have hidden from in their elaborate clowning defenses.

Goheen In print for two decades and translated into eight languages, Albert Wolterss classic formulation of an integrated Christian worldview has been revised and expanded to reach new readers beyond the generation that has already benefited from this clear, concise proposal for transcending the false dichotomy between sacred and secular. Wolters begins by defining the nature and scope of a worldview, distinguishing it from philosophy and theology. He then outlines a Reformed analysis of the three basic categories in human history - creation, fall, and redemption - arguing that while the fall reaches into every corner of the world, Christians are called to participate in Christs redemption of all creation. This Twentieth Anniversary edition features a new concluding chapter, coauthored with Michael Goheen, that helpfully places the discussion of worldview in a broader narrative and missional context.</p><p><b>Nicholas Wolterstorff</b><br> --&nbsp;Yale University<br> "This is the best statement I have come across of the 'reformational' Christian worldview.

Her award-winning books include novels, stories, screenplays, and works of nonfiction, including <i>Monkey Grip</i>, <i>The First Stone</i>, and <i>Joe Cinque&#x2019;s Consolation</i>. <i>The Spare Room</i> is her first work of fiction in fifteen years. She lives in Australia.</p>Helen Garner&#39;s perceptive novel confronts death, dying, and the boundaries of friendship. Nicola has stage four cancer. Refusing to accept defeat, she pursues an alternative cure in Melbourne. She accepts old friend Helen&#39;s invitation to use her spare room while she gets her treatments. This is a funny, upsetting, strangely reassuring look at how far we dare test our friendships. Garner forms her characters in spare, clean prose, describing situations with sharp honesty and tender understanding. From narrator Heather Bolton&#39;s first words, Helen appears, full-blown, down-to-earth, and likable. Bolton handles Nicola&#39;s polar swings neatly, and reveals her self-centered quirkiness without losing her humanity. She keeps Helen&#39;s mounting anger trembling just beneath the surface. A bittersweet, well-told story and a truthful, intelligent performance equal fine listening.

Simultaneous.</p><p>Gr. 5-8. Divakaruni is best known for her poetry and short stories for adults, including her acclaimed fiction collection <i>Arranged Marriages </i>(1995). Her first offering for young readers, part of the Girls of Many Lands series, is a fast, nail-biting adventure set during India's fight for independence. Twelve-year-old Neela is exhilarated when her sister's wedding is interrupted by a band of rough freedom fighters asking for money and food. Neela is swept up by the patriotic excitement, and later, against her mother's protests, she helps to harbor Samar, a wounded fighter. When her father never returns from a protest march, Neela travels alone to Calcutta to find him, and with the help of Samar and his wealthy cousin, hatches a brazen rescue plan. Passages explaining the necessary historical and cultural background are admirably clear but not always well blended into the narrative, and some of the characters and the story's overt messages lack subtlety. But Divakaruni turns a rare subject in children's literature into a well-paced, gripping story that captures universal emotions as well as the complexity of Neela's choices and her anger as she begins to see the facts of colonialism. The precise, vibrant details of time and place (Divakaruni was raised in Calcutta) will put readers next to Neela on the terrifying train rides, the hot, crowded streets and, finally, in the arms of her parents. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>Grade 5-8-Neela, 12, lives in India, where 200 years of British rule has turned sour. When she befriends an underground freedom fighter, Samar, her interest in India's struggle begins to consume her every thought. Her father has joined Mohandas Gandhi's peaceful "civil disobedience" movement, and she becomes determined to help him and Samar fight for her country's freedom. Meanwhile, her mother has brought her news of an offer of marriage, a lucky catch as the boy is from a wealthy and cultured family. Refusing to rush into an engagement, she steals away from home, disguised as a boy, and heads for Calcutta. Neela has several adventures and close calls, but she finds both men and is instrumental in getting them safely home. A strong female protagonist and historical subject matter are limited by a predictable plot. A hinted-at romance between Samar and Neela never emerges and the drama of the country's political tension is watered-down by far-fetched heroics.

Shouldn&#x2019;t come as a shock. This place, they went through a few front windows the first year they were open and decided it was more cost-effective to lay out the extra cash for the safety glass. Save them from having to replace it every time there&#x2019;s a brawl in here. Which is pretty regular I&#x2019;d imagine. Any case, I&#x2019;m not bitching. Wasn&#x2019;t for the guy who had the bright idea, I&#x2019;d be on the sidewalk right now, my good leather jacket cut to ribbons and my face sliced up in all kinds of new and interesting ways. But now it&#x2019;s breaking, it is most definitely breaking. I&#x2019;m sure about that because my face is jammed up against it. The big question for me is whether this is the kind of safety glass that bursts into thousands of tiny pebbles when it breaks or the kind that turns into shards. Pebbles would be fine. Shards, not so much. The window creaks. Tiny fissures appear in front of my eyes.<br><br>OK, time to stop worrying about the glass, time to start worrying about getting this guy off of me. I can&#x2019;t expect any help from the bartenders or the crowd, not after they watched him pound on the bouncer with that pool cue. And I don&#x2019;t see any helpful officers of the law rolling up outside at this point. Not that I have any intention of being here when the cops show up. So, I guess it&#x2019;s just me and him. That&#x2019;s OK, I can go this one alone. Not like it&#x2019;s new to me or anything. I just wish he really was on PCP; if it was just PCP he&#x2019;d be pretty easy to deal with. But this? This is gonna take grace and style, maybe even a little tact.<br><br>He shoves my face harder into the big front window. People out on the sidewalk flinch as they see my features squashed yet flatter against the glass. The glass creaks again. The fissures grow another millimeter. He&#x2019;s still screaming, babbling insanity at the top of his lungs, howling so loud I can barely hear Boxcar Willie on the jukebox:<br><br>You load sixteen tons and what do you get?<br><br>Another day older, and deeper in debt.<br><br>Ain&#x2019;t that the fuckin&#x2019; truth.<br><br>He&#x2019;s enraged that my face won&#x2019;t just explode through the damn glass the way he wants it to. He rears back, and before he can slam my face forward, I&#x2019;ve slipped to my right, spun, twisted my arm free of his grasp, winced as a clump of hair is torn from the back of my scalp, planted my right foot in the hollow behind his right knee, hammered my elbow into the back of his neck and sent him face first through the window in my place. The sidewalk audience scatters as he hits the pavement. I step through the dagger-edged hole he left behind. Shards it is.<br><br>He was spazzing the second he came out of the bathroom.<br><br>Before that, I hadn&#x2019;t even noticed him. Why should I? Not like I&#x2019;m working; not like there&#x2019;s any reason I should be doing anything but paying attention to the booze in my glass, the cigarette in my mouth, the pool game in front of me and the girl by my side. Especially the girl. Girl like this, most everyone in the place is paying attention to her. Want to be invisible? Hang out with a girl like Evie. All that red hair, the body that not only won&#x2019;t quit but works weekends and holidays, too. That smile. She&#x2019;s the kind of girl guys like to look at, but most aren&#x2019;t sure how to go about approaching her. Too bad for them. They miss out on the best part, they miss out on how cool she is, how funny, how sharp, how down-to-earth. Anyway, a girl like Evie on your arm and you turn into a shadow, just the lucky fuck taking up space next to the best view in the place.<br><br>So a night like this, when it&#x2019;s so cold out Evie is wearing her leather pants and that tight old thermal top with the Jack Daniel&#x2019;s label silk-screened across the front, a night like this where she&#x2019;s glued to my hip and every guy in the place wishes he was me, is it any surprise I didn&#x2019;t smell him the moment he came through the door?<br><br>Most nights I would have picked up his scent right off. Couldn&#x2019;t miss it. After all, he smells just like me, only different. But what with the Early Times I&#x2019;m pouring down my throat and the Luckys I&#x2019;m sucking on and Evie rubbing up against me, I just can&#x2019;t be bothered. Still, he couldn&#x2019;t have been in here all that long. Sooner or later I would have smelled him no matter how distracted I was. It wouldn&#x2019;t have meant trouble necessarily; we would have eyeballed each other a bit, sniffed each other&#x2019;s asses like a couple of big dogs, but there wouldn&#x2019;t have been any trouble, not in here, not where everyone can see us. That shit just doesn&#x2019;t happen. As it was, I was lining up a neat little combo that was gonna let me run out the rest of the table and he came out of the john and started spazzing out.<br><br>This wasn&#x2019;t your run-of-the-mill junkie-who-just-shot-up-in-the-can stumbling around. He came out of there like the Tasmanian Devil: spinning, arms flailing, kicking anything that came in range, sending tables and people flying; a full on spaz. A space quickly opened up around him while he whirled and gibbered and foamed at the mouth. The bouncer, a nice enough guy goes by Gears, came over and tried a little sweet talk.<br><br>&#x2014;OK, man, settle down, settle down. Take it easy. Got yourself a dose of some bad shit, but we&#x2019;re gonna take care of you. Got some 911 on the way, gonna get you to an emergency room and get that shit out your system. Just take it easy.<br><br>Moved in slowly, arms spread wide, talking soft. Might as well been trying to soothe a rabid dog. The guy stopped spinning long enough to jump at Gears and swing his arm like a club. Guy was freaky fast. Gears got lucky when he fell on his ass out of the way. Guy&#x2019;s arm hit the backside of a bench made out of two-by-fours and a couple of them cracked. Then he went back to spinning. By this time folks are starting to clear out, and I&#x2019;m starting to pay attention. Gears gets back on his feet, muttering something about fucking PCP, grabs himself one of the cracked and twisted house cues from the rack and goes after the guy. But I&#x2019;ve taken a good whiff by this point and I know the guy ain&#x2019;t on PCP. Gears would be lucky if that&#x2019;s all it was. I mean, I don&#x2019;t know what he&#x2019;s on, but I know he doesn&#x2019;t need it; he&#x2019;s dangerous as hell to start with.<br><br>Gears waits &#x2019;til the guy has spun his back to him, and brings the cue down on top of his head. It makes a nice noise, but before Gears can get too proud of himself or maybe think about bringing the cue back up for another swing, the guy has turned around, snatched the cue away, kicked Gears&#x2019;s legs out from under him and gotten busy finding out how hard it is to break a pool cue by pounding it on someone&#x2019;s face. That&#x2019;s when I figured I should do something. Not that Gears is so big a friend. I barely know him except to call him by name when I come in the place, but The Spaz is out of control, causing the kind of scene that&#x2019;s bad for business. If I don&#x2019;t deal with him, the cops will. That will get very ugly very fast. Nothing causes a scene like when cops start putting bullets in a guy and the guy refuses to go down. Sure, Gears and the law and the press may just chalk it up to a PCP freakout, but there are other people who will hear about it. And some of those people will want to check it out. And I don&#x2019;t want those people around. Not down here. Not in my neighborhood. So I jump on the guy&#x2019;s back. Figure I&#x2019;ll get him to the floor, put a sleeper hold on him and drag him out of here. Make up some story for the crowd about how I know him and I&#x2019;ll take care of it. Get him out before the cops come; get him someplace private and get rid of him before he can make another scene like this one. That&#x2019;s the thing to do. Except he shrugs me right off his back, picks me up off the floor and throws me at the window. And when I bounce off the glass instead of going through it the way he wanted me to, he grabs me by the hair and tries to shove my face through the glass. Lucky for me, strong and fast as he is right now, he&#x2019;s a lousy fighter.<br><br>Once he&#x2019;s on the sidewalk I handle it pretty much like I wanted to inside. Knees in the middle of his back, pin him to the scummy pavement, arm around his windpipe and cut off the O2 until he goes asleep. He does a fair amount of thrashing around, and I have to hold on good and tight to keep from getting bucked clear, but once I&#x2019;m locked on to him I&#x2019;m not going anywhere. When he&#x2019;s nice and sleepy I toss him over my shoulder and point at one of the bartenders who&#x2019;s come out to watch how the story ends.<br><br>&#x2014;Get me a cab, will ya?<br><br>&#x2014;Ambulance is on its way.<br><br>&#x2014;Let &#x2019;em deal with Gears. This guy, I know him. I&#x2019;m gonna take him back to his halfway house. See if I can keep him out of the shit.<br><br>&#x2014;What about the cops? What about the window?<br><br>&#x2014;Hey, come on. I got the guy out of the place. Give me a fucking break.<br><br>&#x2014;Yeah, sure.<br><br>She flags a cab.<br><br>The cabbie&#x2019;s none too happy about me piling in with blood-drippy guy, but he sees I&#x2019;m in no mood for debate and just gives me a dirty rag to put over The Spaz&#x2019;s face. Before we pull away, Evie runs up and passes my pack of smokes and my Zippo through the window.<br><br>&#x2014;Want me to come?<br><br>&#x2014;Nah, I got it covered.<br><br>&#x2014;Meet you back at your place?<br><br>&#x2014;Yeah. Maybe a half hour at the most. You gonna be OK?<br><br>&#x2014;Don&#x2019;t start.<br><br>&#x2014;Right. Sorry &#x2019;bout this.<br><br>&#x2014;&#x2019;S OK. Nobody can say you don&#x2019;t know how to show a girl a good time, Joe.<br><br>The Spaz tries to come to in the cab. I pinch his esophagus and he goes back under before he can cause me any more trouble. I have the cabbie take me down to the Baruch housing project just below Houston. It&#x2019;s a couple blocks outside what I&#x2019;d usually call safe turf, but no one really has a claim on it, so it seems like a good place for an impromptu dump. I manhandle The Spaz up the steps to the pedestrian bridge that spans the FDR to the East River Park. It&#x2019;s nearly two in the morning on a Tuesday. Cars whiz by below, but the lights on the park playing fields were shut off hours ago. My eyes penetrate that darkness just fine. Too cold for any homeless people to be camping out. I do see what looks like a couple junkies sitting on a bench at the far end of the park, but they&#x2019;re facing the river. I pause at the top of the concrete stairs that lead down to the park.<br><br>The Spaz is still alive, alive and reeking of blood. I think about that blood; how I&#x2019;d like to tap a couple pints of it and stick them in my fridge at home to replenish my rapidly shrinking supply. But his blood won&#x2019;t do me any good, won&#x2019;t do anything but make me hellishly sick and kill me. I know that because of what I smelled back at Doc Holiday&#x2019;s; the smell of the Vyrus, the same smell I carry with me. Nonetheless, I&#x2019;m just hard up enough to give him another good sniff. Hell, maybe I was wrong, maybe it was some other Vampyre&#x2019;s scent I picked up in there, maybe this guy really is just whacked on PCP. I inhale. No, no such luck. He&#x2019;s another sad fuck like me. But there is something about him, something about his scent that&#x2019;s a little off. Must be whatever he was taking in the bathroom. No surprise I guess. Whatever he&#x2019;s on would have to be some mean shit not to be neutralized by the Vyrus the moment it entered his bloodstream. Sure would like to know what it was. Be nice to try something like that sometime, something for a distraction. Christ, I drank over a fifth of bourbon tonight and it barely gave me a buzz. The Spaz stirs in my arms.

For the pioneers who streamed out of Missouri it was a land of dreams and freedom. Veteran wagon boss Chance McQuade, a man deadly with a pistol and Sharps, had signed on to take a hundred families there. But the man who hired McQuade was joining the wagon train, and turning it into a brawling, rolling city of sin and violence. Now, on the hard drive West, McQuade faces Kiowa, lightening storms, and killers behind his back-all to reach a promised land that's erupting into war.<br></p><p>Ralph Compton stood six-foot-eight without his boots. He worked as a musician, a radio announcer, a songwriter, and a newspaper columnist. His first novel in the Trail Drive series, The Goodnight Trail, was a finalist for the Western Writers of America Medicine Pipe Bearer Award for best debut novel. He was also the author of the Sundown Rider series and the Border Empire series.&nbsp; CHAPTER 1<br><i>W</i>ithout Rufus Hook being aware of it, Chance McQuade had quietly singled out every man among the hundred families he believed he could trust. Thus more than sixty men within the train were prepared to assist McQuade in any way they could. While it would be impossible for McQuade to be aware of everything that took place within the ranks, word could be relayed to him rapidly. Almost every wagon had at least one good horse trailing on a lead rope, a definite advantage in case of outlaw or Indian attack. Once the train was moving, McQuade rode alongside Ike Peyton&#x2019;s wagon.&#x201c;Ike, I&#x2019;m scouting ahead to find water for the night. If there&#x2019;s trouble, fire three shots.&#x201d;Peyton nodded. Maggie, his wife, sat stiffly beside him. She didn&#x2019;t yet share his dreams of a Texas land grant. As he rode, McQuade sorted out the families, studying strengths and weaknesses. While there were just a hundred emigrant wagons, there were more than four hundred emigrants, for a good four-fifths of the men had wives, sons, and daughters. The rest were single men who had teamed up, with as many as four to a wagon. McQuade saw them as potential trouble, for there had been fistfights over various women, before the train had taken the trail. Some of these single men had bought whiskey in St. Louis, and when boredom overtook them, McQuade reckoned he would have to crack some heads. Eventually he came upon a creek with sufficient graze to supplement the grain carried in each of the wagons.&#x201c;About twelve miles, hoss. About all we can expect out of &#x2019;em, the first day. You get yourself a drink, and we&#x2019;ll ride on back.&#x201d;Estimating the distance at nine miles, McQuade met the wagons. There was something he must settle with Rufus Hook, and he decided to be done with it. Hailing the leaders, he waited until the wagons were near enough for him to be heard.&#x201c;Rein up, when you cross that ridge yonder. Give your teams a rest.&#x201d;McQuade rode on, noting that other wagons had begun to slow as the leaders followed his orders to rest the teams. It would provide an opportunity for McQuade to speak to Rufus Hook. By the time McQuade reached Hook&#x2019;s wagon, it and the rest of his entourage had ground to a halt. Hands on his knees, chewing an unlit cigar, Hook sat like a nervous toad. He said nothing while Lora Kirby eyed McQuade with interest.&#x201c;It&#x2019;s customary to circle the wagons at the end of the day,&#x201d; said McQuade, without any greeting. &#x201c;Do you want to circle your wagons with the rest, or will you have a circle of your own? I suppose I should tell you that most of your emigrants don&#x2019;t favor mixing with whores, gamblers, and gunslingers.&#x201d;Hook laughed, and it was ugly without humor. &#x201c;Is that their terminology or yours, McQuade?&#x201d;&#x201c;Mine,&#x201d; said McQuade bluntly.&#x201c;We have enough wagons for our own circle,&#x201d; said Hook. &#x201c;Never let it be said that Rufus Hook corrupted any righteous man who was unwilling. For those who <i>are</i> willing, you may spread the word that after supper, there will be gambling, whiskey, and other entertainment available at the Hooktown Saloon tent.&#x201d;Lora Kirby laughed, and McQuade said nothing. Words failed him, and he rode away. From the seat of his wagon, Miles Flanagan was watching. Mary sat beside him, and again Chance McQuade was drawn to her. For an instant her eyes met his, and she quickly looked away. On impulse, McQuade reined up next to their wagon.&#x201c;Preacher,&#x201d; said McQuade, &#x201c;when we circle the wagons for the night, Rufus Hook aims to have a circle of his own. Within that circle, there&#x2019;ll be a saloon tent, with whiskey, gambling, and ... women. You&#x2019;re welcome to join our circle.&#x201d;&#x201c;Mr. Hook has promised to build me a church when we reach Texas,&#x201d; Flanagan said stiffly. &#x201c;I must assume he is an honorable man, until he convinces me otherwise.&#x201d;&#x201c;I reckon he&#x2019;s about to do that,&#x201d; said McQuade. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m told the devil quotes scripture when it suits his purpose.&#x201d;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk down to me, you young fool,&#x201d; Flanagan roared.McQuade said no more. Wheeling his horse, he rode back to the head of the caravan.&#x201c;Father,&#x201d; said the girl timidly, &#x201c;suppose he is telling the truth?&#x201d;&#x201c;We shall see,&#x201d; Flanagan said shortly.Reaching the head of the caravan, McQuade waved his hat. &#x201c;Move &#x2019;em out,&#x201d; he shouted.The big wagons rumbled on. A cow got loose from a lead rope and went loping away, pursued by a young girl and her mother. McQuade rode ahead, reining up when he reached the creek where they would circle the wagons for the night. He guided Ike Peyton&#x2019;s and Gunter Warnell&#x2019;s wagons into position, one beside the other. The others, using the first two as a guide, formed a rough circle two abreast. The huge circle crossed the creek at two points, allowing water for the stock and for cooking.&#x201c;All the horses, mules, and other livestock goes into the circle,&#x201d; McQuade shouted.&#x201c;I like that,&#x201d; said Eli Bibb, &#x201c;all the stock bein&#x2019; in the circle.&#x201d;&#x201c;Not often I&#x2019;ve been able to do it,&#x201d; McQuade said. &#x201c;You have to have lots of wagons. This is about the only way to avoid having Indians or renegades stampede the horses and mules.&#x201d;Supper fires blazed at every wagon. It was time for Chance McQuade to take his first meal at Rufus Hook&#x2019;s cook wagon, and he found himself reluctant to go there. What was wrong with him? He put his mind to it, and almost immediately came up with the answer. His confidence lay with the emigrants who squatted around their supper fires, who likely had sold everything they owned, for teams and wagons to take them to the Rio Colorado. That, he concluded, was why he felt like a bull in a sheep pen when he was near Rufus Hook&#x2019;s camp. With misgivings, his dismounted near the cook wagon, nodding to the aged cook, Ampersand. Being there ahead of the others, he accepted the tin plate of food and the tin cup of coffee offered him. There was steak, beans, boiled potatoes, hot biscuits, and dried apple pie. While he couldn&#x2019;t fault the food, he had little appetite. He watched as some of Hook&#x2019;s hired guns erected a large tent. When they had it up, one of them backed a wagon to the entrance. They unloaded tables, chairs, and a roulette wheel. From a second wagon, two men manhandled a barrel of whiskey to the ground. It was rolled into the newly erected tent. The canvas was removed from the first wagon, revealing an upright piano. The rear of the wagon was then backed into the tent. One of the women was helped into the wagon, and taking her seat on a stool, began playing the piano. Even as McQuade watched, men from the farthest circle of wagons, men without wives, wandered into the saloon tent where a makeshift bar had been set up. Four of the men were the Burkes&#x2014;old Andrew, Matthew, Mark, and Luke. They eyed McQuade, daring him to challenge them. But McQuade said nothing, finishing his supper. The woman at the piano struck up a lively tune, and the rest of the women quickly found partners for a rollicking dance. Men had brought tin cups, and the whiskey flowed freely. Snakehead Presnall sat at one of the tables, shuffling a deck of cards. Hook&#x2019;s gun-throwers had begun filing by the wagon, having their plates served. Doctor Horace Puckett and Attorney Xavier Hedgepith sat at one of the tables in the saloon tent, a bottle between them. There was no sign of Rufus Hook or Lora Kirby, but that seemed about to change. As the revelry in the saloon tent increased, the Reverend Miles Flanagan stepped down from his wagon box. For a horrified moment, he fixed his eyes on the saloon tent. Mary Flanagan sat on the wagon seat, her face pale, expecting the worst. It wasn&#x2019;t long in coming. Flanagan stalked to the big tent which had been erected for Rufus Hook and Lora Kirby. Standing there with hands on his hips, he issued a challenge.&#x201c;Mr. Hook, this is the Reverend Flanagan. I would have a word with you.&#x201d;&#x201c;Later,&#x201d; Hook shouted.&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; Flanagan shouted back.Flanagan said no more. Seizing a tent post to the left of the tent, he wrenched it out of the ground. Quickly he repeated his performance with the tent post to the right, and the front of the tent collapsed. Hook fought his way free and stood facing Flanagan. Trying mightily to control his temper, he spoke.&#x201c;Reverend Flanagan, I will excuse a man an occasional mistake. This time, I&#x2019;m making allowances for you being a preacher. I won&#x2019;t do it again. Now tell me what you want, and then get out of my sight.&#x201d;&#x201c;What I want,&#x201d; said Flanagan, &#x201c;is for you to shut down this Sodom and Gomorrah in our midst. When I agreed to accompany you to this proposed town in Texas, I wasn&#x2019;t told of your intention to create dens of iniquity such as this. I won&#x2019;t tolerate it, sir.&#x201d;&#x201c;Preacher,&#x201d; Hook replied, &#x201c;my inviting you to Texas don&#x2019;t give you a license to run my business. We ain&#x2019;t that far from St. Louis. You&#x2019;re welcome to hitch up your teams and return there.&#x201d;With that, he turned away, beckoning to his hired guns, who were eating supper. Four of them put down their plates. While two seized the tent stakes and drew the ropes tight, the others took sledges and drove the stakes back into the ground. Miles Flanagan looked around, and the only friendly face he saw was that of Chance McQuade. It was to McQuade that he spoke.&#x201c;Mr. McQuade, it appears that I have been misled. Is there room for me and my wagon within your circle?&#x201d;&#x201c;There will be by the time you harness your teams and drive there,&#x201d; said McQuade. He nodded to Mary Flanagan, and this time, she didn&#x2019;t turn away.McQuade returned to the circled wagons. When he beckoned to Ike Peyton, Gunter Warnell and Eli Bibb answered his summons, as well as Ike.&#x201c;Gents,&#x201d; McQuade said, &#x201c;Rufus Hook has his saloon tent open. Preacher Flanagan has seen the light, and wants to join our wagon circle. Will some of you make room for him?&#x201d;&#x201c;We will,&#x201d; said Ike, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;d say there&#x2019;s hope for him. I wish I could say the same for some of them from our own circle, that&#x2019;s gone over there.&#x201d;&#x201c;When you&#x2019;ve made a place for Flanagan&#x2019;s wagon,&#x201d; McQuade said, &#x201c;get back to me. I have somethin&#x2019; to ask of you.&#x201d;By moving the Peyton and Warnell wagons, Flanagan was able to drive into the wagon circle, where he unharnessed his teams. The Peyton, Warnell, and Bibb women immediately welcomed Mary Flanagan.&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe the Flanagans have had supper,&#x201d; said McQuade. &#x201c;Can some of you see to feeding them?&#x201d;Quickly the Flanagans were welcomed to a supper fire where the meal was still in progress. Having gotten their wagons back in line, Ike Peyton, Gunter Warnell, and some of the other men sought out McQuade.&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; said Ike, &#x201c;what do you want us to do?&#x201d;&#x201c;Hook included my meals from here to Texas,&#x201d; McQuade said, &#x201c;but my appetite just ain&#x2019;t comfortable around that bunch he&#x2019;s trailin&#x2019; with. I&#x2019;d like to take my meals with some of you folks.&#x201d;&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t feed as well as Hook,&#x201d; said Warnell, &#x201c;but you&#x2019;re welcome to what there is.&#x201d;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t aim for you to feed me for nothing,&#x201d; McQuade said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not rich, but I&#x2019;m not broke. Tomorrow, if one of you will loan me a horse for a pack animal, I&#x2019;ll ride back to St. Louis for a load of grub. All of you talk to your women and see what you&#x2019;re most in need of, and you can share what I&#x2019;ll add to your supplies. I expect the Reverend was to take his meals at Hook&#x2019;s wagon, which he won&#x2019;t be doing, so I&#x2019;ll buy enough to include him and his daughter.&#x201d;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s damn decent of you, McQuade,&#x201d; said Will Haymes, &#x201c;and I promise you won&#x2019;t be sorry. Except for some of the young hell-raisers who have flocked to Hook&#x2019;s saloon, you&#x2019;ll have us all on your side. When we signed on for this journey to Texas, we had no idea that Hook would be going with us, or that we&#x2019;d be surrounded with whiskey, whores, gamblers, and gunmen.&#x201d;&#x201c;Neither did I,&#x201d; McQuade said, &#x201c;and I can&#x2019;t help wondering if Hook will keep his word on the land grants. It&#x2019;s been my experience that if you can&#x2019;t trust a man completely, he&#x2019;ll sell you out at the first opportunity.&#x201d;&#x201c;My God,&#x201d; said Cal Tabor, &#x201c;most of us got nothin&#x2019; to go back to. If we get to Texas and find we&#x2019;ve been cheated&#x2014;if there are no grants&#x2014;what are we goin&#x2019; to do?&#x201d;&#x201c;Hook must have given you some written proof when you joined the train,&#x201d; McQuade said, &#x201c;something to back up his promise.&#x201d;&#x201c;Just a receipt for what we paid,&#x201d; said Gunter Warnell. &#x201c;Stephen Austin died last year and there&#x2019;s to be another overseer appointed. From what I was told, Rufus Hook has been assigned near a million acres, to be deeded to those of us in this train.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinkin&#x2019; about that,&#x201d; Eli Bibb said. &#x201c;Hook&#x2019;s brought his own lawyer. Him, the doc, them two gamblers, and the dozen gunmen, that&#x2019;s sixteen men. What&#x2019;s to stop Hook from assignin&#x2019; rancher grants to all those men, and then buyin&#x2019; &#x2019;em back?&#x201d;&#x201c;Likely, not a thing,&#x201d; said McQuade. &#x201c;Texas is a republic, owned by Mexico, and the nearest authority is in Mexico City. Long before we arrive, I reckon we&#x2019;d better lay some plans of our own, and prepare for a fight.&#x201d;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s somethin&#x2019; everybody in this outfit needs to know,&#x201d; Ike Peyton said. &#x201c;Even them that&#x2019;s over yonder, swillin&#x2019; rotgut in Hook&#x2019;s saloon.&#x201d;&#x201c;I agree,&#x201d; said McQuade, &#x201c;but for starters, speak of it only to those you know we can depend on. There&#x2019;s goin&#x2019; to be enough trouble, without stirrin&#x2019; up any more. When we are nearer the end of this trail, we&#x2019;ll try and pull everybody together, before we have to face up to a showdown with Hook.&#x201d;Suddenly there was a shot from somewhere in the vicinity of Hook&#x2019;s wagon circle.&#x201c;Should some of us investigate that?&#x201d; Ike Peyton asked.&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said McQuade. &#x201c;I reckon this is just a sample of what&#x2019;s ahead. With some of the people from our circle drinking Hook&#x2019;s whiskey, we&#x2019;ll be on the outs with him pronto. Let&#x2019;s shy clear of him for as long as we can.&#x201d;&#x201c;Some of our bunch may get hurt or killed,&#x201d; Will Haymes said.&#x201c;Their choice,&#x201d; said McQuade. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t save a man from his own foolishness, unless he has the brains to see the danger.&#x201d;McQuade found the Flanagans near the Peyton wagon. Maggie Peyton and Ellen Warnell had served them their supper. McQuade said nothing, uncertain as to how he might approach the short-tempered preacher. But Flanagan set his plate down and got to his feet.&#x201c;Mr. McQuade, I owe you an apology. Like most men, I have been selfish, beholding things and men as I wish they were, rather than the way they are. When sin is so great that mortals cannot overcome it, we must flee from it. I have done that.&#x201d;&#x201c;So have I,&#x201d; said McQuade. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m supposed to take my meals in Hook&#x2019;s camp, but I&#x2019;ve decided against it. I&#x2019;ve spoken to Peyton, Warnell, Bibb, Tabor, and Haymes about eating with them, and they&#x2019;ve agreed. Tomorrow, I&#x2019;m borrowing a pack horse and riding back to St. Louis for provisions. I&#x2019;ll see that there&#x2019;s enough to include you and your daughter, if that suits you.&#x201d;&#x201c;While I appreciate your generosity,&#x201d; said Flanagan, &#x201c;I would feel awkward, accepting it. My circumstances have changed, and I will have no means of repaying you.&#x201d;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t expect to be paid for everything I do,&#x201d; McQuade said. &#x201c;The frontier&#x2019;s a hard land, and there&#x2019;s likely not a man among us who won&#x2019;t need help, somewhere between here and the Rio Colorado.&#x201d;&#x201c;He&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; said Maggie Peyton. &#x201c;I believe we&#x2019;ll need you a lot more often than you&#x2019;ll be needing us, Reverend.&#x201d;&#x201c;Perhaps you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Flanagan said. &#x201c;Very well, Mr. McQuade.

Japan is rebuilding her cities after the calamity of World War II, her people putting defeat behind them and looking to the future. The celebrated painter Masuji Ono fills his days attending to his garden, his house repairs, his two grown daughters and his grandson, and his evenings drinking with old associates in quiet Iantern-lit bars. His should be a tranquil retirement. But as his memories continually return to the past - to a life and a career deeply touched by the rise of Japanese militarism - a dark shadow begins to grow over his serenity.</p><p>In <i>An Artist of the Floating World</i>, Kazuo Ishiguro offers readers of the English language an authentic look at postwar Japan, "a floating world" of changing cultural behaviors, shifting societal patterns and troubling questions. Ishiguro, who was born in Nagasaki in 1954 but moved to England in 1960, writes the story of Masuji Ono, a bohemian artist and purveyor of the night life who became a propagandist for Japanese imperialism during the war. But the war is over. Japan lost, Ono's wife and son have been killed, and many young people blame the imperialists for leading the country to disaster. What's left for Ono? Ishiguro's treatment of this story earned a 1986 Whitbread Prize.7 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Eagle Of The Ninth</h2><p>paperback, fine In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>Rosemary Sutcliff has written many historical novels for children. The third in the Eagle of the Ninth trilogy about Roman Britain, 'The Lantern Bearers', won the Carnegie Medal. <br>Rosemary Sutcliff received an OBE in 1975 and in 1993, the year after her death, was awarded the CBE.I&nbsp;Frontier Fort <p>From the Fosseway westward to Isca Dumnoniorum the road was simply a British trackway, broadened and roughly metalled, strengthened by corduroys of logs in the softest places, but otherwise unchanged from its old estate, as it wound among the hills, thrusting farther and farther into the wilderness.</p><p>It was a busy road and saw many travellers: traders with bronze weapons and raw yellow amber in their ponies&#x2019; packs; country folk driving shaggy cattle or lean pigs from village to village; sometimes a band of tawny-haired tribesmen from farther west; strolling harpers and quack-oculists too, or a light-stepping hunter with huge wolf-hounds at his heel; and from time to time a commissariat wagon going up and down to supply the Roman frontier post. The road saw them all, and the cohorts of the Eagles for whom all other travellers must make way.</p><p>There was a cohort of leather-clad auxiliaries on the road today, swinging along at the steady Legion&#x2019;s pace that had brought them down from Isca Silurium at twenty miles a day; the new garrison coming to relieve the old one at Isca Dumnoniorum. On they went, following the road that now ran out on a causeway between sodden marsh and empty sky, now plunged into deep boar-hunted forest, or lifted over bleak uplands where nothing grew save furze and thorn-scrub. On with never a halt nor a change of rhythm, marching Century by Century, the sun bright on the Standard at their head, and the rolling dust-cloud kicked up over the pack-train behind.</p><p>At the head of the column marched the Pilus Prior Centurion, the Cohort Commander, the pride that shone from him showing clearly that this was his first command. They were, he had long since decided, a command worthy of anyone&#x2019;s pride; six hundred yellow-haired giants recruited from the tribes of Upper Gaul, with the natural fighting power of mountain cats, drilled and hammered into what he firmly believed to be the finest Auxiliary Cohort ever to serve with the Second Legion. They were a newly joined Cohort; many of the men had not yet proved themselves in action, and the spear-shaft of their Standard had no honours on it, no gilded laurel wreath nor victor&#x2019;s crown. The honours were all to win&#x2014;perhaps during his command.</p><p>The Commander was a complete contrast to his men: Roman to his arrogant fingertips, wiry and dark as they were raw-boned and fair. The olive-skinned face under the curve of his crested helmet had not a soft line in it anywhere&#x2014;a harsh face it would have been, but that it was winged with laughter lines, and between his level black brows showed a small raised scar that marked him for one who had passed the Raven Degree of Mithras.</p><p>Centurion Marcus Flavius Aquila had seen little of the Eagles until a year ago. His first ten years had been lived quietly with his mother on the family farm near Clusium, while his father soldiered in Judaea, in Egypt, and here in Britain. They had been going to join his father in Britain, but before the time came for them to do so, rebellion had flared up among the northern tribes, and the Ninth Hispana, his father&#x2019;s Legion, had marched north to deal with it, and never came marching back.</p><p>His mother had died soon afterward, leaving him to be brought up in Rome by a rather foolish aunt and the plump and purse-proud official who was her husband. Marcus had loathed the official, and the official had loathed Marcus. They saw everything with different eyes. Marcus came of a line of soldiers&#x2014;one of those Equestrian families who, when the rest of their kind had turned from soldiering to trade and finance, had kept to the old way of life, and remained poor but held their noses high in consequence. The official came of a line of officials, and his code of life was quite other than Marcus&#x2019;s. Neither of them had a shred of understanding for each other&#x2019;s ideas, and they had both been thankful when Marcus was eighteen and could apply for a centurion&#x2019;s commission.</p><p>Marcus, his eyes narrowed into the sun as he marched, smiled to himself a little wryly, as he remembered how almost pathetically thankful that plump official had been. (Tramp, tramp, tramp, said the cohort&#x2019;s feet behind him.)</p><p>He had asked to be sent to Britain, though it meant starting in an auxiliary cohort instead of a line-of-battle one, partly because his father&#x2019;s elder brother had settled there when his own years of soldiering were done, but mostly because of his father. If ever anything became known of the lost Legion, it would be known first in Britain, and it might even be that here in Britain he would find out something for himself.</p><p>Marching down the Isca Dumnoniorum road in the run-honey evening light, he found himself thinking about his father. He had very vivid memories of a slight, dark man with laughter lines at the corners of his eyes, who had come home from time to time, and taught him to fish, to play &#x201c;Flash the Fingers,&#x201d; and throw a javelin. He remembered vividly that last leave of all. His father had just been appointed to command the First Cohort of the Hispana, which meant having charge of the Eagle and being something very like second-in-command of the Legion besides; and he had been like a jubilant boy about it. But his mother had been faintly anxious, almost as if she knew...</p><p>&#x201c;If it was any other Legion!&#x201d; she had said. &#x201c;You have told me yourself that the Hispana has a bad name.&#x201d;</p><p>And his father had replied: &#x201c;But I would not have it any other Legion if I could. I held my first command in the Hispana, and a man&#x2019;s first Legion is apt to hold chief place in his heart ever after, be its name good or bad; and now that I go back to it as First Cohort, we will see whether there is nothing can be done to better its name.&#x201d; He had turned to his small son, laughing. &#x201c;Presently it will be your turn. It has fallen on evil days, but we will make a Legion of the Hispana yet, you and I.&#x201d;</p><p>Looking back across the years, Marcus remembered that his father&#x2019;s eyes had been very bright, like the eyes of a man going into action; and the light had caught suddenly in the great flawed emerald of the signet-ring he always wore, striking from it a spark of clear green fire. Odd how one remembered things like that: little things that somehow mattered.</p><p>(Tramp, tramp, tramp, came the sound of the cohort&#x2019;s feet behind him.)</p><p>It would be pleasant, he thought, if Uncle Aquila was like his father. He had not met his uncle yet; after learning his foot-drill he had arrived in Britain in the sleety days of late autumn, and been sent straight up to Isca; but he had a rather vague invitation to spend his leave with him at Calleva, when he had any leave to spend. It would be very pleasant if Uncle Aquila was like his father.</p><p>Not of course that he and his uncle were likely to have much to do with each other. In a few years&#x2019; time he would probably be serving in quite a different part of the Empire, since a Cohort Centurion seldom moved up all the way in the same Legion.</p><p>All the way...from his present rank right up to his father&#x2019;s rank of First Cohort; and after that? For most of the men who got so far there was nothing after that, but for the outstanding few who went further&#x2014;as Marcus intended to go further&#x2014;the ways divided there. One could become a Camp Commandant, as Uncle Aquila had done, or one could go on, by way of the Praetorian Guard, to try for command of a Legion. Legion Commanders were almost always men of Senator&#x2019;s rank, with no experience of soldiering save a year&#x2019;s service as Military Tribune in their youth; but by long custom the two Egyptian Legions were exceptions to the rule. They were commanded by professional soldiers; and an Egyptian Legion had been Marcus&#x2019;s shining goal for as long as he could remember.</p><p>But one day, when he had finished with the Eagles, when he had made an honourable name and become Prefect of his Egyptian Legion, he would go home to the Etruscan hills, and perhaps even buy back the old farm, which the plump official had ruthlessly sold to defray expenses. For a moment he remembered almost painfully the sunlit courtyard flickered over with the shadow of pigeons&#x2019; wings, and the wild olive tree in the loop of the stream, on a twisted root of which he had once found a kind of gall growing, that was shaped something like a little bird. He had cut it from the root with the new knife his father had given him, and spent much loving care, all one absorbed summer evening, trimming and carving feathers on it. He had that little bird still.</p><p>The road topped a gentle rise, and suddenly Isca Dumnoniorum lay before them, with the fortress-crowned Red Mount dark with shadows against the evening sky; and Marcus came back to the present with a jerk. The farm in the Etruscan hills could wait until he was old and tired and famous; in the present was the glory of his first command.</p><p>The British town was spread below the southern scarp of the Mount; a sprawling huddle of reed-thatched roofs, every colour from the gold of honey to the black of dried peat, according to the age of the thatch; with the squared, clean lines of the Roman forum and basilica looking oddly rootless in their midst; and the faint haze of woodsmoke lying over all.</p><p>The road led straight through the town and up to the cleared slope beyond, to the Praetorian gate of the fort; here and there, crimson-or saffron-cloaked men turned to look at the cohort as it swung by, a look that was reserved rather than hostile. Dogs sat scratching in odd corners, lean pigs rooted among the garbage piles, and women with bracelets of gold or copper on very white arms sat in hut doorways, spinning, or grinding corn. The blue smoke of many cooking-fires curled up into the quiet air, and the savoury smell of many evening meals mingled with the blue reek of woodsmoke and the sharper tang of horse-droppings, which Marcus had by now come to associate with all British towns. Little that was Roman was here as yet, despite the stone-built forum. One day there would be straight streets, he supposed, and temples and bathhouses and a Roman way of life. But as yet it was a place where two worlds met without mingling: a British town huddled under the dominion of the turf ramparts where once the tribe had had its stronghold and now the Roman sentries paced up and down. He looked about him under the curve of his helmet as he marched, knowing that this place would be part of his life for the next year; then looked up to the turf ramparts, and saw a Roman banner drooping in the still air and the tall crest of a sentry burning in the sunset, and heard a trumpet-call ring out, as it seemed, from the fiery sky.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You have brought clear skies with you,&#x201d; said Centurion Quintus Hilarion, lounging in the window of the Commander&#x2019;s quarters, and peering into the night. &#x201c;But Hercle! you need not expect it to last.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As bad as that?&#x201d; said Centurion Marcus Aquila, who was seated on the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Quite as bad as that! It rains always, here in the west, save when Typhon, the father of all ills, brews up a mist to come between a man and his own feet. By the time you have served your year here you will have toadstools sprouting out of your ears, the same as me, and not from the damp alone!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;From what besides?&#x201d; enquired Marcus with interest. &#x201c;Oh, lack of company, for one thing. I am a sociable soul myself; I like my friends around me.&#x201d; He turned from the window, and folded up on to a low cushioned bench, hugging his knees. &#x201c;Ah well, I am off to rub away the blue mould as soon as I have marched the troops back to Isca.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Going on leave?&#x201d;</p><p>The other nodded. &#x201c;Long leave, lovely leave, among the flesh-pots of Durinum.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Durinum&#x2014;that is your home?&#x201d; asked Marcus. &#x201c;Yes. My father retired and settled there a few years ago. There is a surprisingly good circus, and plenty of people&#x2014;pretty girls too. A pleasant enough place to get back to, out of the wilds.&#x201d; An idea seemed to strike him. &#x201c;What shall you do when your leave falls due? I suppose, coming out from home, you have no one here to go to?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have an uncle at Calleva, though I have not yet met him,&#x201d; Marcus said, &#x201c;and certainly there is no one at home I should want to spend my leave with.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Father and mother both dead?&#x201d; enquired Hilarion with friendly interest.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. My father went with the Ninth Legion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pericol! You mean when they&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Disappeared. Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So. That is bad!&#x201d; said Hilarion, wagging his head. &#x201c;A deal of ugly stories, there were&#x2014;still are, for that matter; and of course, they did lose the Eagle.&#x201d;</p><p>Instantly Marcus was up in arms to defend his father and his father&#x2019;s Legion. &#x201c;Since not a man of the Legion came back, it is scarcely a matter for wonder that neither did the Eagle,&#x201d; he flashed.</p><p>&#x201c;Surely not,&#x201d; agreed Hilarion amicably. &#x201c;I was not blowing on your father&#x2019;s honour, so you can keep your feathers on, my Marcus.&#x201d; He looked up at the other with a wide, friendly grin, and suddenly Marcus, who had been ready to quarrel with him the instant before, found himself grinning back.</p><p>It was several hours since Marcus had marched his Cohort across the hollow-ringing bridge, answering the sentry&#x2019;s challenge, &#x201c;Fourth Gaulish Auxiliaries of the Second Legion, come to relieve this garrison.&#x201d; Dinner was over, in the officers&#x2019; mess, with the Quartermaster, the Surgeon, and the double complement of ranker Centurions. Marcus had taken charge of the pay-chest keys&#x2014;in a garrison as small as this there was no paymaster; and for the past hour, here in the Commander&#x2019;s quarters in the Praetorium, he and Hilarion had been going through the office work of the frontier fort. Now, crested helmets and embossed breastplates laid aside, the two of them were taking their ease.</p><p>Through the doorless opening Marcus could see almost the whole of the sleeping-cell, the narrow cot piled with gay native rugs, the polished oaken chest, the lamp-bracket high on the bare wall, and nothing more. The outer room held the battered writing table on which Marcus was sitting, a cross-legged camp-stool, the cushioned bench to represent comfort, another chest for the record rolls, and a bronze pedestal lamp of peculiarly hideous design.</p><p>In the little silence that had fallen between them, Marcus looked round him at the austere room in the yellow flood of lamplight, and to him it seemed beautiful. But though it would be his tomorrow, for this one night he was a guest here, and he looked back to his host with a quick smile of apology for having looked too soon at his surroundings with the eye of mastery.</p><p>Hilarion grinned. &#x201c;You will not be feeling like that this day next year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder,&#x201d; said Marcus, swinging one sandalled foot and idly watching the swing of it. &#x201c;What does one do here, besides growing toadstools? Is there good hunting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good enough; it is the one thing to be said for this particular corner of the Empire. Boar and wolf in the winter, and the forest swarms with deer. There are several hunters below in the town, who will take you out for the price of the day&#x2019;s work. Unwise to go alone, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>Marcus nodded. &#x201c;Have you any advice for me? I am new to this country.&#x201d;</p><p>The other considered. &#x201c;No, I think not.&#x201d; Then he sat up with a jerk. &#x201c;Yes, I have, if no one has warned you already. But it has nothing to do with the hunting. It is the priest-kind&#x2014;the wandering Druids. If one of them appears in the district, or you get the least idea that there is one about, look to your weapons. Good advice, that is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Druids?&#x201d; Marcus was surprised and puzzled. &#x201c;But surely Suetonius Paulinus dealt with them once and for all, sixty years ago?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As an organized priesthood, maybe; but as easily hold off these heathen mists with a palm-leaf umbrella as end the Druids by destroying their strong...</p></p><h2>The First Epistle of Peter (New International Commentary on the New Testament)</h2><p>Peters first letter to the early churches is a significant expression of New Testament theology and pastoral care.

Frequently asked how he managed to be so extraordinarily successful while never giving up the fight for justice and equality, Bell decided to spend his seventieth year writing a book of insight and guidance. The result, <i>Ethical Ambition</i>, is a deeply affecting, uplifting, and brilliant series of meditations that not only challenges us to face some of the most difficult questions that life presents, but dares to offer some solutions.</p><p>Using incidents from his own life, Bell also looks to literature, history, and other contemporary figures who have refused to compromise their beliefs. In chapters that explore passion, faith courage, inspiration, humility, and relationships, <i>Ethical Ambition</i> address the most fundamental issues of life.</p></p><p><p><b>Derrick Bell </b>is an internationally recognized legal scholar, civil rights activist, and writer. He currently teaches at New York University School of Law, and is the author of seven books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Faces at the Bottom of the Well.</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Ethical Ambition</i> is an immensely stirring work that speaks directly to the daunting challenge faced by thousands of people who are torn between the dictates of their conscience and the practical realities of a remorselessly and often brutally competitive society. Seldom has the self-sustaining passion of a life lived boldly, but with self-examining humility, been so courageously and honestly conveyed. A generation thirsting for a life of meaning in an age of market-driven anomie will be profoundly grateful to the author for the lessons he has drawn out of a long career of activist integrity within the ever-uncompleted work of justice.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jonathan Kozol, author of Savage Inequalities</i></p><p>&#x201c;Derrick Bell's <i>Ethical Ambition</i> carefully lays out the possibility of both being successful and living by one's core values, one's ethical convictions. Bell is the ultimate teacher, a mentor to all of us.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Anna Deavere Smith, actor and playwright</i></p><p>&#x201c;Derrick Bell is one of the great race men in America, but his intellectual range, moral passion, and the literary gifts transcend the chains of any one people and belong to us all. He is a gift to the nation, and so too are all his works. His voice is a clear trumpet amidst the noise.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Peter J. Gomes, minister of the Memorial Church at Harvard and author of The Good Book and The Good Life</i></p><p>&#x201c;Derrick Bell's <i>Ethical Ambition</i> is a concise, beautifully written guide to the true good life, written by a man of true principles and morals.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>James McBride, author of The Color of Water and Miracle at St. Anna</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Ethical Ambition</i> moved me to tears and then to action. Derrick Bell writes with passion and beauty--rarely the gift of one so scholarly. This new work is the treasure I've been waiting for.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Susan L. Taylor, editorial director, Essence magazine, and author of In the Spirit</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Ethical Ambition</i> is an inspirational Baedeker, a guide to translating one's convictions into action in everyday life, and a reminder not to mistake athletic or self-centered risk-taking with true courage. If everyone could live as ethically and passionately as Derrick Bell, humanity would take an evolutionary leap forward.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Letty Cottin Pogrebin, author of Deborah, Golda, and Me: Being Female and Jewish in America and Getting Over Getting Older</i></p><p>&#x201c;Bell shares his experiences of living an ethical life in the crucible of conflict, discrimination and protest. Bell notably walked away from a tenured position at Harvard Law School to protest the lack of minority women faculty members (he is now a visiting professor at NYU). When many asked how he could give up such a successful position, Bell responded that material success could not satisfy his desire to succeed ethically by pointing out the inequities of the system. Bell contends that religious faith and his religious community have provided the foundations for his desire to live an ethical life, and he urges those who would live with moral integrity to explore a variety of faiths. He stresses the importance of commitment in relationships, as well as the necessity of humility in serving others. Finally, he discusses a series of 'ethical inspirations' ranging from Martin Luther King Jr. and Paul Robeson to Medgar Evers and Daniel Ellsberg. Bell's noble aspirations to lead a life of ethical ambition may inspire others.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>In Search Of A Leader The Complete Search Committee Guidebook</h2><p>Great book for search committees.</p><p></p><h2>Herod: King of the Jews and Friend of the Romans (Studies on Personalities of the New Testament)</h2><p>This book provides a stunning look at the king who had an extraordinary impact on Roman-era Palestine. The author integrates historical, archaeological, and social analyses, writing with clarity and enthusiasm for his subject. The charts, maps and diagrams make this a very accessible tool for use in the classroom. Richardson portrays Herod in the complexity of his Judean and Roman frameworks.</p><p>Peter Richardson&#39;s biographical study of Herod (73-4 BCE) offers insight into the personality of the man who served as the most prominent member of the substantial Herodian family and whose rule shaped the world in which the Christian faith arose. Richardson reveals Herod to be far more complex and important than is generally perceived and demonstrates that an understanding of Herod holds great value for comprehending the relationship between Judea and Rome. Setting his study against the crosscurrents of Jewish and Roman culture in the first century, Richardson emphasizes the social and historical context in which Herod&#39;s life unfolded and evaluates the family matters, patronage, religious developments, and ethnic issues that shaped his reign. Richardson details Herod&#39;s active participation in political events during the making of the Roman Empire and his close association with such prominent figures as Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, Cassius, Octavian (Augustus), Cleopatra, and Marcus Agrippa. In addition to telling Herod&#39;s life story, Richardson recounts the legends that grew up around the man - including his responsibility for a massacre of young children in Bethlehem. Richardson&#39;s accessible, and relatively positive, assessment of Herod sheds new light on a fascinating but much maligned character.Peter Richardson is professor, Centre for the Study of Religion, and past principal of University College at the University of Toronto.</p><h2>The Red Rose Girls: An Uncommon Story of Art and Love</h2><p>Illustrators Jessie Willcox Smith (1863-1935) and Elizabeth Shippen Green (1871-1954), and muralist Violet Oakley (1874-1961) captivated early-20th-century society with their brilliant careers and uncommon lifestyle.

After studying together under the sympathetic guidance of Howard Pyle in Philadelphia, the three (all youngest siblings) decided that they could work best away from the distractions of the city. In 1900, they established their home and studios in a rambling country house called the Red Rose Inn, leading Pyle to dub them the "Red Rose Girls." Strengthened by the emotional support and artistic inspiration that each gave the others, their careers blossomed. Green was a successful illustrator, especially for <i>Harper's Magazine</i>; Smith produced charming portraits of children; and Oakley was famous for huge murals commissioned to decorate state buildings. With their friend Henrietta Cozens acting as "housewife," their unconventional living arrangement attracted much interest, not all of it positive. Carter, a professor at San Jose State University, claims that it freed them from the domestic responsibilities and isolation that could cripple an artist, especially a female artist in pre-emancipated society. For eight years the four led an almost idyllic existence of genteel lifestyle and artistic productivity, but eventually the group disintegrated, with Green's marriage causing an especially painful break. Carter's sympathetic, easy prose perfectly complements the women's idealized art and their uncomplicated belief in the goodness of life. Combining delightful photographs of their domestic lives with examples of their work, <i>The Red Rose Girls</i> re-creates a vanished world of optimism and grace. <i>--John Stevenson</i>Alice A.

A tubercular orphan at age eight, he discovered the nascent fields of vegetarianism and weight lifting, and at the turn of the century founded <em>Physical Culture</em>, the most influential health magazine of all time and the cornerstone of a thirty-million-dollar media empire. His disciples included Upton Sinclair and Charles Atlas; among his employees were Walter Winchell, Ed Sullivan, and Eleanor Roosevelt.

Finally, she strikes out for the countryside on her own, selling her soul to an affable but rather simpleminded devil. First written in the 1920s, this book is timely and entertaining. It was the first selection of the Book of the Month Club in 1926.</p><p>Sylvia Townsend Warner began her literary career as a poet, and her first novel is as nimble and precise as poetry and reads as if it might have been composed to a meter. Like some of Jane Austen's fiction, <i>Lolly Willowes</i> is a comedy about the perils, pleasures, and consolations of spinsterhood, and the predicament of its heroine is at first deliberately and deceptively commonplace. "Aunt Lolly, a middle-aging lady, light-footed upon stairs, and indispensable for Christmas Eve and birthday preparations," is nevertheless troubled by vague, indefinable longings, a hankering after the solitude of woods and dark rural places. At last a revelation in a greengrocer's leads her to abandon her outraged London family and take rooms in an obscure hamlet, Great Mop.<p> Here her neighbors keep curiously late and noisy hours, but otherwise allow her to pass the time "in perfect idleness and contentment." She is eventually pursued into her idyll, however, by her nephew, and Titus's familiar small demands drive her to rage and despair: "No! You shan't get me. I won't go back. I won't.... Oh! Is there <i>no</i> help?" She is promptly visited by a mysterious black kitten, who fastens its claws upon her hand and draws blood. At once she understands. The kitten is her familiar, and has been sent by dark forces. "She, Laura Willowes, in England, in the year 1922, had entered into a compact with the Devil."</p><p> She has, in short, become a witch--or, rather, she has rediscovered her own slumbering diabolical potential, in the unlikely setting of a Buckinghamshire hamlet that--as she now realizes--is peopled entirely by witches. Laura soon attends a rollicking but ultimately rather disappointing midnight Sabbath; she is visited by Satan in the shape of a pleasant-faced man in a corduroy coat and gaiters who rids her of Titus and restores her to privacy and peace. She is left with a vision of the women "all over England, all over Europe ... as common as blackberries, and as unregarded" to whom he has offered the promise of adventure, "the dangerous black night to stretch your wings in." It is this vision that lends the novel its subversive edge, that ultimately allies it less with the work of Austen than with that of Virginia Woolf, and with later feminists. They "know they are dynamite," says Laura of Satan's women, "and long for the concussion that may justify them." <i>--Sarah Waters</i></p>Born in Harrow (1893-1978), Sylvia Townsend Warner published seven novels, four volumes of poetry, a volume of essays and eight volumes of short stories. She lived most of her adult life with her close companion Valentine Ackland in Dorset and Norfolk.</p><h2>Henry Knox: Bookseller, Soldier, Patriot</h2><p><p>A hearty eater, dapper&nbsp;dresser, bookseller to Loyalists and Patriots alike,and&nbsp;married into a staunch Loyalist family,&nbsp;Henry Knox may seem an unlikely hero.But his fascination with warfare and strategy and his support of the Patriot cause prepared him to do what no one else thought was possible: transport heavy artillery from Fort Ticonderoga, up and down snow-covered hills and across frozen lakes, to relieve the siege of Boston. The dramatic story of his achievements is all the more satisfying for being absolutely true, a little-known episode in the history of the American Revolution. <i>Source notes, time line, bibliography, map.</i></p></p><p>Anita Silvey has spent more than forty years in the children&#39;s book field, including several years as the Vice President and Publisher of Childrens Books for Houghton Mifflin Company, and eleven years as editor-in-chief at the Horn Book Magazine, during which time she launched the bi-annual publication of the Horn Book Guide. She is the author of &#34;100 Best Books for Children&#34; and the Children&#39;s Book-A-Day Almanac (childrensbookalmanac.com)Gr 3-6&#x2013;This is a beautifully illustrated introduction to a lesser-known Revolutionary War figure. As a child, Knox worked in a bookstore where he read about engineering and military history and became fascinated by machinery. He went on to open his own bookstore and specialized in works on military science. After fleeing Boston due to the intensifying conflict with British soldiers, he soon joined the Continental Army. He was then named head of artillery, though the army's only artillery was 300 miles away at Fort Ticonderoga. Silvey emphasizes Knox's obstinacy in the face of challenges. It was this spirit, she argues, that spurred him to oversee transport of 12,000 pounds of artillery over frozen mountains and lakes to General Washington in Boston. The narrative ends with his success. Further details on the war and on Knox's life are provided in a time line. Silvey's account is admiring but unornamented, and history buffs and future engineers especially will find some inspiration here beyond the biography report. Minor brings the arduous journey to life through vivid paintings of the Colonial figures and unforgiving landscape. Many are presented in striking spreads. Richard M. Strum's biography (OTTN, 2007) is highly readable and more comprehensive, but Minor's engaging paintings of a memorable incident will make a nice supplement to Revolutionary War units.&#x2013;Jayne Damron, Farmington Community Library, MI.

Fascinated by the question of uncertainty, Mar�as eschews the solution and prefers to revel in the narrative process itself, and asks the reader to consider the possibility that the truth as we know it isn&#x2019;t nearly as interesting as its own shadow.</p><p>Mar�as's second novel was written in the early '70s when he was 21, and it has all of the stylistic grace and wry invention that has put Mar�as on the Nobel shortlist. An unnamed narrator ruminates on the intentions of a man (variously called Holden Branshaw and Hordern Bragshawe) who decides not to publish a novel written by an unnamed author who died penniless pursuing the life of that novel's subject: Victor Arledge, an author who died a recluse at age 38. The plot is pure Borges; the elongated sentences reflect nested perspectives in a manner that recalls Conrad's <i>Heart of Darkness</i>. The bulk of the book is devoted to the reading aloud of the novel, titled<i> Voyage Along the Horizon</i>; it's set around 1900 and concerns a voyage of French and English writers, Arledge among them, to Antarctica headed by an American patrician and former steamboat captain named Kerrigan. The goal&#x2014;a collaborative work based on their travels&#x2014;gets derailed by a variety of stock fictive plot points. The reserved 19th-century diction is flawlessly translated throughout, and Mar�as's joy in folly is everywhere evident. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

To judge from the first-person introductions to the recipes presented here, he has spent considerable time since then traveling throughout the country, enjoying the earthy, regional cooking of country homes and neighborhood bistros. Saut&#x201a;ed tripe, roast calf's liver, eel stew, and jugged hare are among the lusty dishes that take his fancy--though about the liver he admits that ``I haven't had much luck with [this] method, but...if you'd like to try....''- -hardly an inducement to do so. Many ingredients, too, he deems just not the same stateside--often insufficiently gamey for him-- but he can usually recommend acceptable American products. Villas also dispenses advice to other gastronomic travelers, who can follow his lead to the real thing. Either way, his own impassioned and informed appreciation is persuasive. For an undiluted taste of real French food, look no further. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Unlike those who championed the civilizing graces of the agrarian frontier, DeVoto drew inspiration from the mercenary, imperial designs of the fur trade. <i>The Course of Empire</i>, the most elaborate of his chronicles of mountain men and their impact on U.S. history, meticulously accounts for every major Euro-American expedition and enterprise west of the Alleghenies from the 1520s through the 1830s.<p> In exploiting the West's resources, trappers, priests and explorers had to find new ways of navigating, mapping, and staking territorial claims. Eventually they made alliances amongst some of the native inhabitants and war upon hostiles and interlopers in order to protect their nation's trade routes. This unique political economy, according to DeVoto, ultimately shaped the budding republic's belief that it was destined to rule the continent. By emphasizing how indigenous social and environmental factors effected the protocols of conquest, <i>The Course of Empire</i> foreshadowed cultural studies such as Henry Nash Smith's <i>Virgin Land</i> and Richard Slotkin's trilogy of books on "the myth of the American frontier." Its linkage of geography to the concept of empire also puts it in dialogue with the histories of William Cronon and Donald Worster. In a field marked by rapid conceptual change, DeVoto's analysis has retained its relevance to the present day. <i>--John M. Anderson</i></p>Bernard DeVoto (1897-1955), winner of the Pulitzer Prize, was a renowned scholar-historian of the American West and one of the country&#39;s greatest men of letters.</p><h2>The Sugar Fix: The High-Fructose Fallout That Is Making You Fat and Sick</h2><p>In <i>The Sugar Fix,</i> Dr. Richard Johnson, who oversees a pioneering research program, reports on discoveries about how fructose impacts the body&#x2014;and directly connects the American obesity epidemic to a frightening escalation in our fructose consumption. <br><br>It comes as no surprise that the sugar is found in processed foods like candy, baked goods, canned foods, and frozen meals in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, but it is also hidden in less obvious foods like peanut butter, egg products, and soups. Many fruits and vegetables contain high levels of it naturally. Dr. Johnson shows how to cut way back on the sweetener by making effective substitutions. The daily meal plans included here contain no more than 25 grams of fructose, one-quarter of the amount the average American now ingests. <br><br>Rather than the low-carb approach of so many recent diets, Dr. Johnson recommends a much easier to enjoy and stick to formula: 50% carbs, 25% fat, and 25% protein. The immediate benefit of this diet is to help anyone shed excess weight. The additional benefits are even more impressive&#x2014;reduced risk for such serious health problems as high blood pressure, elevated blood fats, and insulin resistance, conditions directly linked to heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, and stroke.</p><p>RICHARD JOHNSON, MD, has been a practicing physician and clinical scientist for over a quarter of a century. Previously chief of nephrology and director of renal transplantation at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Dr. Johnson is now chief of nephrology, hypertension, and transplantation at the University of Florida in Gainesville.CHAPTER 1<br><br>THE FRUCTOSE FACTOR<br><br>A Sugar Like No Other<br><br>A century ago, few Americans were overweight. Heart disease and diabetes were rare medical conditions. Today, people who are plump and paunchy outnumber those who are thin and fit in the United States and many other parts of the world. Heart attacks are the leading cause of death. The incidence of diabetes has exploded into a full-blown epidemic.<br><br>What happened? How could such dramatic changes to overall health occur during this relatively brief period in human history? I believe the rise of obesity and these formerly rare diseases can largely be traced to a single factor. Unlike a disease-carrying microbe, however, this culprit is hiding in plain sight--on the shelves at your local supermarket, in the cooler at the convenience store, and very likely in your refrigerator and kitchen cupboard.<br><br>The goal of this book is to help you understand, identify, and avoid this menace. What's more, I am going to show you how to reverse the damage it may have already caused in your system.<br><br>You don't need to be a doctor or scientist to see the most obvious signs of this scourge's handiwork. Simply walk through a shopping mall or playground- -that is, if you haven't already noticed the problem in your bathroom mirror. In other words, consider how the American physique has changed over the years.<br><br>In the 19th century, few people in this country worried about their waistlines. It's not that our ancestors didn't care about their weight. The fact is, fat people were extremely rare, typically found among the upper class. After all, only the wealthy could afford to overindulge in rich, decadent foods back then. In 1890, for example, a survey of more than 5,000 white males in their fifties found that just 3.4 percent were obese.<br><br>However, that once-lean population has gone the way of hoop dresses and top hats. Today, 32 percent of Americans are obese. What's more, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an additional one-third of Americans are overweight, meaning they are not quite obese but still have an unhealthy amount of body fat. When you do the math, it adds up to an alarming problem: Two-thirds of Americans are either obese or overweight. However, unlike in the 19th century, weight problems afflict all segments of the population--rich and poor, young and old, every race and educational background. The nation's schoolyards may offer the most disturbing view of this epidemic: One in three children in the United States is overweight or obese.<br><br>Doctors and public health authorities are alarmed by the nation's growing girth for good reason. Carrying around excess weight increases the risk for deadly conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and kidney disease. What's more, being fat in a culture that idolizes slender and beautiful celebrities can be psychologically crippling. But what's most worrisome, and most puzzling, is why obesity rates are rising so rapidly. On the eve of the American bicentennial--in 1975, when the nation had been in existence for nearly 200 years--the obesity rate in the United States reached 15 percent. Since then, in a period of just 30 years, the obesity rate more than doubled.<br><br>Why? What has caused America to become so flabby so fast?<br><br>Frustrated dieters often blame their genes. Perhaps you have tried to lose weight in the past, but you couldn't shed those extra �ds. Or maybe you managed to trim down, but the weight eventually returned. If so, in the back of your mind, you may have been tempted to blame your parents. After all, if you have your mother's eyes or your father's smile, doesn't it make sense that you got your chunky thighs or bulging belly from them, too?<br><br>In fact, scientists have isolated genes that may be linked to obesity. But we merely inherit a tendency for one body shape or another from our parents. Whether or not you become overweight and obese depends largely on the lifestyle choices you make--that is, what foods you eat and how much exercise you get. Further, when you consider the bigger picture, it's hard to imagine how genetics could possibly be blamed for the current rapid rise in obesity. After all, the human genetic code dates back millennia. Has some mutation in the human genome occurred across the US population during the past 3 or 4 decades that is causing widespread uncontrollable weight gain? That's highly unlikely. In fact, such a genetic alteration would have to be occurring in populations all over the world, because obesity rates are rising in countries across the globe.<br><br>Instead, something must have changed in our environment that is exploiting the human tendency to accumulate body fat. A couple of obvious candidates come to mind. For instance, you no longer need to be wealthy to eat a waist- expanding diet. Thanks to advances in farming, manufacturing, and shipping, delicious high-calorie foods are cheap and widely available. Meanwhile, Americans burn fewer calories each day than our ancestors did, due to the rise of laborsaving devices, from the lawn mower to the laptop computer.<br><br>But while there is no doubt that Americans eat too much and don't exercise enough, I believe that some other mechanism has contributed to the disturbing and unprecedented weight gain that has swept across the United States in recent years. Reams of data that have emerged from research labs over the past decade indict a specific food: a common form of sugar called fructose that most of us eat every day.<br><br>Americans consume 30 percent more fructose today than in 1970. Our rising consumption of this sugar began at roughly the same time that obesity rates in the United States were climbing sharply. In the pages that follow, I will explain why I believe these corresponding trends are intimately linked- -why feeding on so much fructose is fueling a public health catastrophe in the United States, and how you can lose weight and safeguard your overall health by limiting your exposure to this dangerous sweetener.<br><br>The Fructose Connection<br><br>Fructose has always been part of the human diet, since the first hungry forager plucked an apple from a tree or berries from a bush. That's because fructose, as the name suggests, is the main form of sugar found in fruit. Honey is another abundant natural source. What's more, half of every crystal of refined sugar consists of fructose, too.<br><br>If you have read much about fructose lately, that's probably because it is the critical component in a controversial sweetener called high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is used in a wide variety of processed foods and beverages. Most brands of soda and many kinds of candy contain HFCS. If you were to start reading product labels, you'd find that HFCS is also in many foods that might surprise you, such as pasta sauce, yogurt, soups, ketchup and other condiments, and sandwich bread. In 1970, the average American consumed less than 1/2 �d of HFCS per year. By 2000, per capita consumption of the corn-based sweetener had risen to more than 42 �ds per year.<br><br>Critics call HFCS "Frankensyrup" and other damning names, blaming it for the current outbreak of obesity, especially among children in the United States. In later chapters, I'll examine HFCS more closely and sort out some of the claims its defenders and detractors have made. For now, though, here's the important point: There is mounting scientific evidence that consuming too much fructose, no matter where it comes from, can make you fat and increase your risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and kidney disease.<br><br>Fructose and Your Waistline<br><br>In the past generation, scientists from all over the world have begun to closely examine fructose and its effects on human health. My colleagues and I at the University of Florida are actively involved in this research. We have made a number of discoveries about changes that occur in the body from consuming fructose and certain other foods and how they can cause weight gain and health problems. Our work, along with investigations conducted by other scientists, strongly suggests that America's fondness for fructose- rich foods is fueling the obesity epidemic. I will discuss these findings in greater detail throughout this book, but here is a snapshot of what we have learned so far.<br><br>Eating a high-fructose diet causes rapid weight gain. Eating too much of any form of sugar will make you fat. However, recent studies--performed in my laboratory, as well as by other scientists--have found that animals gain weight very quickly and develop other unhealthy symptoms when they eat too much fructose. Yet the same thing does not occur when animals are fed equal amounts of other sugars. In other words, eating fructose appears to cause greater weight gain than other forms of sugar, even if the same number of calories is consumed.<br><br>High-fructose foods do not satisfy your appetite. When you eat most types of sugar, your body responds by producing appetite hormones, which signal your brain that your body has consumed enough food to meet its energy needs. As this occurs, feelings of hunger subside. But unlike other sugars, fructose escapes the attention of appetite hormones. Because of this phenomenon, your brain never gets the message that your body has consumed a load of calories. As a result, the appetite center in your brain remains unsatisfied, so you continue eating. In one study, subjects felt hungrier after drinking beverages sweetened with fructose than they did after drinking beverages that contained another simple sugar, glucose. This may mean that fructose tricks you into eating more calories than your body needs. The result? You gain weight.<br><br>High-fructose foods may interfere with the signaling system that controls your appetite for all foods. We have discovered another way in which a high- fructose diet encourages overeating. Chronic consumption of sugary foods seems to promote biochemical changes that prevent the brain from receiving messages from appetite hormones--even when you are not consuming fructose. We have shown that this phenomenon leads to substantial weight gain in animals, and some studies suggest that it occurs in humans who consume too much fructose, too.<br><br>Fructose may sabotage weight-loss efforts. Your body does not metabolize fructose in the same way that it processes other sugars. When fructose enters a cell, enzymes break it down. Unfortunately, the actions of these enzymes raise blood pressure, increase blood levels of artery-clogging fat, and eventually cause obesity. As if that weren't bad enough, eating fructose actually increases your body's production of the very enzymes that cause all of these problems. Over time, your body may produce such a high concentration of these enzymes that eating foods that contain even a small amount of fructose will set in motion all of the powerful biological changes that we believe cause obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other related conditions. This phenomenon may help explain why obese people struggle to lose weight and keep it off: Their bodies become ultraresponsive to fructose.<br><br>People who consume a lot of soft drinks and fruit juice--two major sources of fructose--tend to be overweight. Several large population studies have shown that people who drink beverages sweetened with fructose are more likely to be overweight than people who avoid soft drinks and juice. The "Supersize Me!" phenomenon is partly to blame. HFCS is cheaper than refined sugar, so fast-food restaurants and the beverage industry have been able to sell extra-large servings of soda and other fructose-rich beverages at low prices, which has led people to consume more calories. Soft drinks appear to pose another problem for anyone trying to control their weight and stay healthy. Consuming fructose rapidly--the way you might when gulping down a cola or bottle of fruit juice--causes levels of this sugar to soar in the blood. Studies suggest that could lead to greater weight gain.<br><br>Beyond Obesity<br><br>As every doctor learns in medical school, obesity raises the risk for many common conditions, including heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and kidney disease, among others. As I just explained, strong evidence suggests that consuming too much fructose will make you gain an unhealthy amount of weight. Recent research has revealed that exposing the body to too much fructose makes you sick in other ways, independent of its effect on weight. In fact, I believe that consuming excessive amounts of fructose not only is making the United States one of the fattest nations in the world, but it also is hastening the rise of several of the leading killers in this country.<br><br>Indeed, even if you are currently eating a low-calorie diet and you are at a stable weight--or even if you are currently losing weight--you may still be creating health problems if your diet contains too much fructose. Actually, you could end up developing many of the complications associated with obesity, even though you are not obese. With this in mind, it's worth noting that rates of several other serious conditions, in addition to obesity, have soared at the same time that consumption of fructose has risen.<br><br>High blood pressure. Over the past 30 years, the number of Americans with high blood pressure has climbed by 20 percent. About 73 million people in this country have high blood pressure, also called hypertension, making it the most common disease in the United States. While hypertension often has no symptoms, it can have serious consequences, because it raises the risk for stroke, heart failure, and kidney disease.<br><br>Type 2 diabetes. The incidence of diabetes in the United States has increased by about 35 percent since 1994. A rare disease in this country as recently as the late 19th century, diabetes now affects more than 20 million Americans. New cases of type 2 diabetes account for almost all of this dramatic rise. This condition used to be called adult-onset diabetes, but its name was changed to reflect the unfortunate new reality: Like obesity and hypertension, type 2 diabetes has become commonplace among children and adolescents.<br><br>Kidney disease. During the past quarter-century, the incidence of end-stage renal disease, or kidney failure, has nearly quadrupled. Meanwhile, about 20 million Americans have mild to moderate degrees of kidney disease. Unfortunately, while treatment can slow its progression, there is little we can do to stop it completely.<br><br>Liver disease. In the past, a condition known as fatty liver occurred primarily in poorly nourished alcoholics. Now we know that too much nourishment--that is, overeating, which results in obesity--can cause a condition called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Once exceedingly rare, NAFLD now affects 15 to 30 percent of Americans, including 6.5 million children. This disease can lead to complete liver failure and has become one of the most common reasons for liver transplantation. Recent studies by our group strongly suggest that consuming too much fructose may cause this condition.</p><h2>52 Lessons on Communicating Love: Tips, Anecodotes, and Advice for Connecting with the One You Love From America&#39;s Leading Relationship Therapist</h2><p>In this delightfully informative and entertaining book, Dr. Ruth K.

After critical undercover mission went horribly wrong, Bryson was retired to a new identity. Years later, his closely held cover is cracked and Bryson learns that the Directorate was not what it claimed - that he was a pawn in a complex scheme against his own country's interests. Now, it has become increasingly clear that the shadowy Directorate is headed for some dangerous endgame - but no one knows precisely who they are and what they are planning. With Bryson their only possible asset, the director of the CIA recruits Bryson to find, reinfiltrate, and stop the Directorate. But after years on the sidelines, Bryson's field skills are rusty, his contacts unreliable, and his instincts suspect.<br> <br>With everything he thought he knew about his own life in question, Bryson is all alone in a wilderness of mirrors - unsure what is and isn't true and who, if anyone, he can trust - with the future of millions in the balance.<br></p><p><i>The Prometheus Deception</i> begins with a deep-cover operative, a beautiful cryptographer with a shadowy past, a government organization that's not what it seems, and an assignment that goes very, very wrong. Nicholas Bryson, a spy for a secret intelligence group known only as the Directorate, has his cover blown on a Tunisian operation and is retired to a new identity: Jonas Barrett, lecturer in Near Eastern history at a small liberal arts college. Five years later, the CIA corners Bryson/Barrett and tells him that his entire 15-year career in the Directorate was a fraud, that the organization was really an elaborate front for the GRU--Soviet military intelligence--and that his former boss, Ted Waller, was actually Gennady Rosovsky, a GRU muckety-muck. Even Bryson's beloved estranged wife, Elena, was actually a Romanian Securitate agent assigned to keep him in line. And now...<p> </p><blockquote>"Damn it!" Bryson shouted. "This makes no sense! How ignorant do you think I am? The goddamn GRU, the Russians--that's all in the past. Maybe you Cold War cowboys at Langley haven't yet heard the news--the war's over!"<p> "Yes," Dunne replied raspily, barely audible. "And for some baffling reason the Directorate is alive and well." </p></blockquote> So far so good; after 22 thrillers in this vein, Robert Ludlum could probably have written this one in his sleep. Fortunately for his fans, he was not only awake at the wheel, but ready to race--on a track with more twists and bumps than a roller coaster in an earthquake. The CIA claims it needs Bryson to reinfiltrate the Directorate and help them bring it down, but when Bryson is cornered by an erstwhile Directorate acquaintance aboard a floating arms bazaar and rescued by a woman named Layla just before the ship blows up, he begins to realize how the years of retirement have dulled his formerly keen reaction time. While Bryson cautiously feels (and fights) his way from Virginia to Spain and back again, mistrustful of his new CIA colleagues even as he dodges murder attempts by his former Directorate henchmen, there are rumblings in the hallowed halls of the U.S. Congress. Several respected statesmen are raising a ruckus about widespread invasions of privacy, behind which stand a Seattle software billionaire and a mysterious nexus of power called Prometheus. But is Prometheus allied with the Directorate--or with a different group altogether? Filled with post-Cold War double-crosses, New Economy high jinks, and even a few Wall Street shenanigans thrown in for good measure, <i>The Prometheus Deception</i> is pure old-style Ludlum, repackaged for the new millennium. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i><p><b>The ultimate spy.</b></p><p>After fifteen years as a brilliant master spy, Nick Bryson has disappeared into anonymity as a professor at an exclusive college in western Pennsylvania&#x2015;until he's suddenly lured back into the game.</p><p><b>The ultimate threat.</b></p><p>Recruited by the CIA, Bryson has been commissioned to track the moves of the Directorate.

And Man Creates God tells readers, for the first time, what religious feeling is really about, what it consists of, and how it originates. It is a beautifully written, very accessible book by an anthropologist who is highly respected on both sides of the Atlantic. As a scientific explanation for religious feeling, it is sure to arouse controversy.</p><p>What's it all about? Though we might never answer the really big questions--with good reason--maybe we can understand why we ask them. Cognitive anthropologist Pascal Boyer tackles this topic in the unapologetically titled <i>Religion Explained</i>, and it is sure to polarize his readers. Some will think it's an impermissible invasion of mental territory beyond the reach of reason; others will see it as the first step toward a more complete understanding of human nature--and Boyer is acutely aware of the emotionally charged nature of his work. This knowledge informs his decision to proceed without caution, as he warns readers early on that most will risk being offended by some of his considerations. Readers who can lay aside their biases will find great rewards here; Boyer's wide scholarship and knack for elegant writing are reasons enough for reading his book.<p> </p><blockquote> That gods and spirits are construed very much like persons is probably one of the best-known traits of religion. Indeed, the Greeks had already noticed that people create gods in their own image.... All this is familiar, indeed so familiar that for a long time anthropologists forgot that this propensity requires an explanation. Why then are gods and spirits so much like humans? </blockquote><p> Peppering his study with examples from all over the world, particularly the Fang people of Africa, Boyer offers plenty of evidence for his theory that religious institutions exist to maintain particular threads of social integrity. Though he uses the tools of evolutionary psychology, he is more careful than most EP proponents to avoid ad hoc and circular arguments. Best of all, at least to those unmortified at the idea of examining religion critically, his theories are potentially testable. Even if he turns out to be dead wrong, at least <i>Religion Explained</i> offers a new and powerful framework for thinking about our spiritual lives. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>A brilliant and provocative exploration of the nature of human religious belief and what it can tell us about human psychology and evolution, in the tradition of Steven Pinker?s <i>The Language Instinct</i>.</p><h2>Creativity and Taoism</h2><p>In good overall condition</p><p></p><h2>American Azaleas</h2><p>Other than a few Asiatic and one European species, North America is home to all the deciduous azaleas, members of the genus Rhododendron.

But if those dreams are divinely inspired, hope is far from lost. You just need to know how to visualize the path to your dream to make it a reality. <br> <br> Born a poor Cajun boy in south Louisiana, Jesse Duplantis was a rock musician in his early years and, after a life-changing experience with God, became one of the most candid, and popular, ministers of the Gospel today.

Doing is better. When I first began in ministry, the Lord told me that I was going to be preaching the Gospel on worldwide television one day. Now, at that time, that looked about as possible as seeing a pig fly over south Louisiana. I barely had enough money for gas to fill up my car. I felt blessed to preach in a church that sat fifty people. And, I sure didn't think that, with my accent and my Cajun heritage, that anyone would want to listen to me preach the Gospel on TV. </p><p> Still, I knew the voice of the Lord. My life had been completely turned around through another man's television ministry and I knew that God would use me to reach others through the same vehicle. </p><p> I grew up along the banks of the Mississippi River, in south Louisiana. I learned early that nobody was going to take care of me, but me. I saw a lot of poverty and a lot of hypocrisy. I experienced hardship from a young age and I had a pretty bad view of the church in general, but my mother was a strong believer and a strong woman, and she instilled the Scriptures in me from the time I was a young boy. Still, I didn't believe it and I just wanted to get out. </p><p> So, although I made my own choices and used my musical talent to get out of Louisiana and play rock music as a young man, when I came back around and gave my life to God, I knew that it meant change...change not only in my spirit and in my heart, but also in my mind. <b></b></p><p><b> Mental Changes, Mental Choices </b> </p><p> When I decided to follow the teachings of Jesus and the Bible, it was also a decision to change my mental strategies. Before, I didn't understand spiritual concepts like faith. But after I accepted Christ and chose to go this way in my life, I began to get a clearer picture of what it meant to think God's way, to trust Him and start living by the teachings in His Word. </p><p> Years later, after I accepted God's call on my life and entered the ministry, God dropped the idea of preaching the Word on worldwide television into my mind. It was a big thought and, I knew, totally beyond my means. </p><p> It could have easily stayed in the realm of dreaming, but I decided to move that thought out of idleness into the realm of real faith. To even begin doing that, I had to "reboot" my mind, so to speak, and actually consider that the dream <i>could</i> come to pass. After all, everything around me told me that I couldn't do it. But, I knew that this was a "God-thought" -- a thought that was not about me, but about reaching more people for Him. </p><p> That day, I began developing a "mental map" -- a determined thought-life -- that I knew would be a key in reaching what I believed God had told me would be part of my destiny. I knew that this thought wasn't a pipe dream. It wasn't a thought that I wanted to dismiss with a "well, maybe one day" kind of attitude. I knew in my heart that I needed to go deeper with the idea that I considered to be "God-revealed." <b></b></p><p><b> Mental Maps Are Determined Thoughts </b> </p><p> You see, daydreams are idle thoughts. They can be fun. They can be a form of escape. But mental maps are the kind of thoughts that have purpose and direction. They're the thoughts with intent, thoughts that are actually taking you somewhere that you want to go. You could call them "determined" thoughts. </p><p> You know the difference. Think about it. Have you ever been watching TV and a commercial for cake mix comes on the screen? Shot one, you're suddenly seeing close-ups of a butter-yellow cake with chocolate icing. The announcer is telling you how good it is as, shot two, that steaming cake comes sliding out of the oven. </p><p> Shot three, you watch a fork press down on the top of the cake and the cake just fluffs right back up, like the freshest thing ever made. Shot four, they get a tight angle on a knife sliding across the top of that cake with chocolate frosting so thick and so close that you can almost reach out and grab it. </p><p> Shot five, a big old slice of that cake sits on a plate as another fork cuts right down and lifts up quick to take the first bite -- the act of the fork coming up quick creates a perfect little twirl of chocolate icing. It looks like it's just waiting for that fork to come in and make that next bite...which the fork never does. Instead, the camera zooms in closer and closer to the cake. The name brand of the mix comes on the screen and it's all over. The TV is rolling on to something else. </p><p> Okay, now, here's where thoughts come in. You've just seen the commercial. You start wanting that cake. You sit there for a second and imagine tasting yellow cake with chocolate icing. It's just an idle thought, a passing thought. </p><p> A "determined" thought is different. It has intent and passion behind it. A determined thought isn't content to remain idle, it gives you an idea! </p><p> In this case, a determined thought gives you the idea of preheating the oven. Then, it is this kind of thought that actually gets your rear off the sofa at ten at night! It's the kind of thought that has you speeding to the grocery store to get that mix, the kind of thought that has you reading the back of the box in your kitchen and going through all the steps it takes to have that cake mixed, baked, and frosted, so that you can sit right back down where you were before in front of the TV...except with a hot slice of cake on a plate in your hand and a big smile of accomplishment on your face! My wife and I do this kind of thing once every few years. I know what I'm talking about! </p><p> Now, do you see the difference? An idle thought keeps you on the couch. A determined thought gets you inspired to <i>move</i>. </p><p> <b>From Mental Maps to Reality</b> </p><p> Here's how it goes. A mental map begins with determined thoughts. Those determined thoughts produce ideas. Those ideas produce actions. And those actions -- combined with faith in God, trust in His Word, and the tenacity to never give up -- are what will draw your dream into reality. </p><p> Many people wander through life with big dreams, but they don't have determined thoughts -- thoughts that will make them <i>believe</i> what it takes, <i>say</i> what it takes, and even <i>change</i> what it takes to start <i>doing</i> what it takes and moving that dream to reality. </p><p> Instead, they live in the world of idle thoughts, which may be entertaining, sure, but that's about as far as the thoughts ever go. Dreaming is good. It's a God-given gift to be able to imagine and to dream. Doing is better, because doing -- actually acting on your dreams -- is what moves your life forward and brings greater fulfillment. </p><p> It all starts with thoughts. </p><p> In this book, I hope to inspire you through biblical passages and stories, and my own personal experiences, to stop thinking idly and start thinking with intent and determination -- to start building "mental maps" that will get you moving in the right direction. Maps that will lead you to the good life and the good destiny that God has in store for you. </p><p> <b>You Determine Where You Go in Life</b> </p><p> Destiny isn't fate. It's not firm. It's not something that just <i>happens</i> to you or something that is going to happen no matter what. </p><p> No. <i>You</i> are the architect of your own life. <i>You</i> have free will. You have choices that you can make that will determine your future, and that puts you in the driver's seat. You may not have picked the car! You may not have picked the town you're in! But, you still have power because you still have free will and choice. </p><p> Sure, there are events that happen which might put you in the right place at the right time...but if you don't choose to <i>do</i> the right thing, in that moment, nothing is going to happen! </p><p> It's sort of like health and money. It doesn't matter how healthy you are. If you don't have any money, you ain't going anywhere! And, you can have all the money in the world, but if you're as sick as a dog, you ain't going anywhere either! </p><p> A God-given destiny is sort of like that. Certain things have to be in line for you to get the best result, but ultimately, <i>you</i> are going to determine where you go and what you do in this life. </p><p> Nobody is a puppet. God created this earth and the Bible says that He gave it to the children of men (Psalm 115:16), which is you and me. We have to take ownership over what is ours, or we will lose it. Our choices in this life make a difference, but nothing happens without thoughts, which is what mental mapping is all about. </p><p> What will we allow ourselves to believe that we can accomplish? What will we do with the good thoughts, good ideas, and good concepts that God has given us? Are these thoughts good? Are they worth pursuing? Do they make us feel passionate? Are they God's way of nudging us to fulfill His good plan, which is His will for our lives? </p><p> Can we take those good thoughts and build upon them day by day and reach the good life God has for us? Yes, we can. Abraham did it. Thousands of Christians do it every day, and even nonbelievers can use the principle and see some results. </p><p> Taking a thought that you believe is God-revealed and praying about it, focusing on it, and letting it develop into an idea, which produces an action, which leads to more actions on the path to God's good plan for your life...well, that's mental mapping, and anybody can do it and see results. </p><p> <b>Mental Mapping Is a Spiritual Concept</b> </p><p> Mental mapping is a spiritual concept, and spiritual concepts always apply to our lives in a real way, even if they don't appear to do so on the surface. </p><p> The Bible tells us that spiritual things, such as mental mapping, are foolish to those who only think naturally. </p><blockquote> <p> <i>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.<br> But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.<br> For who hath k...</i></p></blockquote></p><h2>The Word Snoop: A Wild and Witty Tour of the English Language!</h2><p>Meet the Word Snoop.

Yet his reign has a significance in English history out of all proportion to its brief six-year span. In this lavishly illustrated book, Diarmaid MacCulloch underlines the significance of Edward's turbulent and neglected reign. He takes a fresh look at the life and beliefs of the young king and of the ruthless politicians who jostled for power around him and analyzes the single-minded strategy for bringing in the Protestant revolution. Although the regime collapsed in apparent failure and disgrace on Edward's death in 1553, the story does not end there; a second half-sister, Elizabeth, succeeded Mary and brought Protestantism back to the official Church, though in a subtly different form. The tensions between her vision of the Church and that of the dead boy king continued to haunt English religion. MacCulloch traces the strange afterlife of Edward's reign, its surprising connections with the civil wars which convulsed the British Isles a century later, and the effect it still has on English life.</p></p><p>"This is Reformation history as it should be written, not least because it resembles its subject matter: learned, argumentative, and, even when mistaken, never dull."&#x2014;Eamon Duffy, author of <i>The Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England, 1400-1580 </i><b>Diarmaid MacCulloch</b> is a prize winning author and Professor at Oxford University.</p><h2>The United States of Arugula: How We Became a Gourmet Nation</h2><p>One day we woke up and realized that our &#x201c;macaroni&#x201d; had become &#x201c;pasta,&#x201d; that our Wonder Bread had been replaced by organic whole wheat, that sushi was fast food, and that our tomatoes were heirlooms. How did all this happen, and who made it happen? <i>The United States of Arugula </i>is the rollicking, revealing chronicle of how gourmet eating in America went from obscure to pervasive, thanks to the contributions of some outsized, opinionated iconoclasts who couldn&#x2019;t abide the status quo.<br><br><i>Vanity Fair </i>writer David Kamp chronicles this amazing transformation, from the overcooked vegetables and scary gelatin salads of yore to our current heyday of free-range chickens, extra-virgin olive oil, <i>Iron Chef</i>, Whole Foods, Starbucks, and that breed of human known as the &#x201c;foodie.&#x201d; In deft fashion, Kamp conjures up vivid images of the &#x201c;Big Three,&#x201d; the lodestars who led us out of this culinary wilderness: James Beard, the hulking, bald, flamboyant Oregonian who made the case for American cookery; Julia Child, the towering, warbling giantess who demystified French cuisine for Americans; and Craig Claiborne, the melancholy, sexually confused Mississippian who all but invented food journalism at the <i>New York Times</i>. The story continues onward with candid, provocative commentary from the food figures who prospered in the Big Three&#x2019;s wake: Alice Waters and Jeremiah Tower of Berkeley&#x2019;s Chez Panisse, Wolfgang Puck and his L.A. acolytes, the visionary chefs we know by one name (Emeril, Daniel, Mario, Jean-Georges), the &#x201c;Williams&#x201d; in Williams-Sonoma, the &#x201c;Niman&#x201d; in Niman Ranch, both Dean <i>and</i> DeLuca, and many others.<br><br>A rich, frequently uproarious stew of culinary innovation, flavor revelations, balsamic pretensions, taste-making luminaries, food politics, and kitchen confidences, <i>The United States of Arugula </i>is the remarkable history of <i>the</i> cultural success story of our era.</p><p><p>david kamp has been a writer and editor for <i>Vanity Fair</i> and <i>GQ</i> for more than a decade.

But precisely <i>what</i> Beard began bears some explaining. Though she's among the foremost of Beard's prot�g�s, the cookbook author Barbara Kafka can't contain her exasperation at the received wisdom that there were no good meals to be had in America until her mentor reared his enormous head. "It's like there was no food in this fucking city, or this country, until this miraculous apparition came along!" she says. "Or there was no cooking at home until Julia. Don't tell me this kind of nonsense! I think that Le Chambord,* which I went to as a child, was probably the best French restaurant that New York has ever seen and will ever see. And in the West Forties, way over, there were bistros lined up and down. Guys got off the ships right opposite the biggest harbor, practically, in the world--off the <i>Normandie</i> and the <i>Ile de France</i>. And they were French guys."<br><br>So, yes, it is wrongheaded to presume that Americans did not eat well until the Big Three became big. The very first American cookbook, <i>American Cookery</i>, written by a Connecticut woman named Amelia Simmons and published in 1796,* demonstrates that there were both cooks and eaters in those days who appreciated fine ingredients and flavorful food. <i>American Cookery</i> is considered the "first" American cookbook because, though several cookbooks had been published before it in the colonies and the young republic, they were adaptations or reprints of European cookbooks, mostly British. Simmons's book, on the other hand, was expressly aimed at born-and-bred Americans who used ingredients not available in Europe, such as the "pompkins" she used in a "pudding" recipe that differed very little from our current ones for Thanksgiving pumpkin pie. Her "Indian Slapjack," a cornmeal pancake of the sort now found on the menus of upscale Santa Fe bruncheries, would have gone very nicely with her "Beft bacon" (printers had not yet sorted out their use of <i>f</i>'s and ornamental <i>s</i>'s), which, in a manner that would excite today's aficionados of artisanal foodstuffs, was cured in molasses, sea salt, and saltpeter for six to eight weeks and then smoked over corncobs.<br><br>Further evidence of a culinarily attuned America comes in the most celebrated cookbook of the nineteenth century, <i>The Virginia House-wife</i>, by Mary Randolph, a pillar of late-eighteenth-century Richmond society (her brother was married to Thomas Jefferson's daughter), who, after her husband experienced some reversals of fortune, ran a boardinghouse and collected her recipes into a book, published in 1824. Not only was <i>The Virginia House-wife</i> a work of astonishing breadth and worldliness--Mrs. Randolph knew how to cook everything from the expected Ye Olde dishes like roast goose and Indian-meal pudding to seemingly very contemporary offerings like polenta and ropa vieja (Cuban- or Spanish-style shredded beef)--but her respectful use of vegetables was downright Alice Waters-ish. Randolph cautioned against overcooking asparagus, and advised that a perfect salad should have "lettuce, pepper grass, chervil, cress &amp;c.," which "should be gathered early in the morning, nicely picked," and served with a lovely tarragon vinaigrette.<br><br>President Jefferson was himself quite the epicure and procurer of exotic foodstuffs, importing seeds from Europe to plant in his garden and cultivating Mediterranean fig, olive, and almond trees at Monticello. In his personal "Garden Book," he kept records of what produce was available at Washington's vegetable market during the years of his presidency, 1801 to 1809, and the sheer variety sounds much like what a latter-day foodie might gush over at San Francisco's Ferry Plaza Farmers Market on a bountiful summer day: sorrel, broccoli, strawberries, peas, salsify, raspberries, Windsor beans, currants, endive, parsnips, tomatoes, melons, cresses.<br><br>All this said, not for nothing is the United States known as a meat-and-potatoes kind of place. In the early years of the republic, it wasn't uncommon for Americans to have beefsteak not only for dinner, which was consumed at midday, but for <i>breakfast</i>--a habit only exacerbated as the country expanded westward, opening more land for ranching. Foreign visitors to the United States in the nineteenth century routinely expressed their shock at the huge, meaty smorgasbords set out on groaning boards in the public rooms of hotels at all hours of the day, not to mention the joyless, gluttonous dispatch with which the natives went about the business of eating. Charles Dickens declared that Americans ate "piles of indigestible matter." Thomas Hamilton, another Englishman, wrote an account of his journey to the United States in 1833 called <i>Men and Manners in America</i>, in which he observed, "In my neighborhood there was no conversation. Each individual seemed to his food down his gullet, without the smallest attention to the wants of his neighbor." The food in these places wasn't of high quality, either, with vegetables boiled to a fare-thee-well and starchy potatoes and puddings served in great quantities. The Canadian historian Harvey Levenstein, in a droll study of early-American dietary habits called <i>Revolution at the Table</i>, notes that "the enormous amounts of meat and starch and the short shrift given to fresh fruits and vegetables made constipation the national curse of the first four or five decades of the nineteenth century in America."<br><br>It's hard to square this bleak picture with the Edenic one painted by Mary Randolph and Thomas Jefferson, and, indeed, the feisty old culinary historian Karen Hess, who edited and wrote the introduction to the facsimile of the first edition of <i>The Virginia House-wife</i>, dismisses the work of Levenstein, her rival, as that of a "stupid idiot." (As she points out, the Randolph cookbook alone presents clear evidence to refute Levenstein's assertion that in the nineteenth century "herbs were used mainly for medicinal rather than culinary purposes" in America.) Still, it's possible for an unbiased observer to use Hess's and Levenstein's works complementarily and draw the conclusion that while the United States had some terrific cooks, cornucopian markets, and an abundance of wonderful homespun culinary traditions, it also had some serious food issues. The novelist James Fenimore Cooper, author of <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>, spent several years in France as a U.S. consul, living in Lyons, the nation's gastronomic capital. Upon his return home in 1833, he recorded his horror at the state of American food, calling his fellow Americans "the grossest feeders of any civilized nation ever known," a culinarily clueless people who subsisted on a diet of "heavy, coarse, and indigestible" fare. The chasm between French and American food was all the more appalling to Cooper because he grew up wealthy in the woodsy hinterlands of upstate New York, where all manner of wild game roamed and edible plants grew, and knew that his country could do better.<br><br>But the United States, a country wary of elitism and susceptible to populist, xenophobic demagogues, would always have mixed feelings about taking culinary cues from the French. Long before the age of "freedom fries" and the efforts by an adviser to George W. Bush to damage John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign by saying the Massachusetts senator "looks French," the advisers to the Whig presidential candidate of 1840, William Henry Harrison, tried to smear the Democratic incumbent, Martin Van Buren, as a fey monarchist aristocrat--on the evidence that he drank champagne and had hired a Frenchman to be White House chef. The scrappy old soldier Harrison, on the other hand, subsisted on "hard cider" and "raw beef and salt," and won the election.*<br><br>Whether it was a matter of this country's Puritan origins, its early inheritance of British culinary stodginess, or just a general don't-tread-on-me stubbornness, America would always have a dysfunctional relationship with the idea of culinary sophistication. A strain of the Harrison campaign's plainspoken beefy populism persists to this day: in 2004, the CEO of the fast-food chain Hardee's, Andrew Puzder, touted the company's Monster Thickburger--a 1,420-calorie sandwich composed of two one-third-pound beef patties, three slices of cheese, and four strips of bacon on a buttered, mayonnaise-spread bun--as "not a burger for tree-huggers." (Many of whom, presumably, look French.) Similarly, the thickset founder of the Wendy's chain, Dave Thomas, did a commercial in the nineties in which he addressed a grateful roomful of 300-pounders who called themselves the "Big Eaters Club." In another spot, Thomas portrayed himself as being trapped at a pretentious cocktail party where a mincing waiter offered him a dainty, absurd-looking hors d'oeuvre and said, "Crab puff, sir?" Cut to a shot of a relieved Dave back at Wendy's, sinking his teeth into an enormo-burger.*<br>&nbsp;<br>On the other end of the spectrum were those who shied away from fancy feeding for ascetic or religious reasons.

Anderson grew up on the coast of the Mississippi River. He is best known for his Horn Island watercolors. This wild, uninhabited island was his inspiration and refuge for weeks at a time&#x2014;his only shelter, the rowboat he used to get there. He would climb trees and wade in the water to capture his subjects; "Art was an adventure, and Walter Anderson was an explorer, first class." While a museum in Ocean Springs, LA, eventually housed much of his art, Hurricane Katrina destroyed the family's personal collection, and Anderson's cottage was left in ruins. Through simple language and quirky details, Bass makes an eccentric, unknown subject exciting and accessible to children. A lengthy author's note includes a more detailed account of Anderson's unorthodox life as well as reproductions of his work. Lewis's watercolors, in the blues, greens, grays, and browns of nature, capture the isolated beauty and wildness of the island.

Had it failed&#x2014;as many at the time feared it would&#x2014;it&#x2019;s possible that the United States as we know it would not exist today.<br> <br>The Constitution was a broad set of principles. It was left to the members of the First Congress and President George Washington to create the machinery that would make the government work. Fortunately, James Madison, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and others less well known today, rose to the occasion. During two years of often fierce political struggle, they passed the first ten amendments to the Constitution; they resolved bitter regional rivalries to choose the site of the new national capital; they set in place the procedure for admitting new states to the union; and much more. But the First Congress also confronted some issues that remain to this day: the conflict between states&#x2019; rights and the powers of national government; the proper balance between legislative and executive power; the respective roles of the federal and state judiciaries; and funding the central government. Other issues, such as slavery, would fester for decades before being resolved.<br> <br><i>The</i> <i>First Congress </i>tells the dramatic story of the two remarkable years when Washington, Madison, and their dedicated colleagues struggled to successfully create our government, an achievement that has lasted to the present day.</p><p>Fergus M.

Sheets of icy rain, sleet, and sometimes snow waterlogged much of the farmland around Alexandria and turned the roads into glutinous muck that played havoc with travelers&#x2019; schedules. One of those travelers, in late February of 1789, a diminutive figure bundled against the cold, had crossed Virginia from his home near the Blue Ridge Mountains to see a friend who was also the most famous man in America. As he approached George Washington&#x2019;s Mount Vernon, James Madison would first have noticed the long avenue of broad-boughed, winter-bare oaks, and eventually the stately house itself, porticoed and colonnaded on its bluff overlooking the river. Madison was en route to New York City, to take up his duties in the new Congress that was about to come into being. Mount Vernon was out of his way. A more direct route would have taken him across the Potomac at Georgetown, Maryland, and from there directly to Baltimore. But Washington had summoned him, a trusted prot�g� who they both knew was likely to play a central role in the great debates that were to come. Denied one of Virginia&#x2019;s Senate seats by his political opponents, Madison had just won a hard-fought contest against his friend James Monroe for a seat in the House of Representatives. Enemies of the Constitution, who were both passionate and powerful in Virginia, had warned that the election of Madison would produce &#x201c;rivulets of blood throughout the land.&#x201d; Fortunately such dire predictions did not come to pass.<br> <br>Washington wanted help with his inaugural address, which the president-to-be would deliver in April. He had first entrusted the job to his aide David Humphreys, who had delivered a seventy-three-page behemoth of an oration full of policy proposals that expressed Washington&#x2019;s support for a powerful federal government and an assertive executive. Madison told Washington, in essence, to toss Humphreys&#x2019;s handiwork: it was too long and tried to say too much. Instead, he urged Washington to speak more simply to a fragile nation that was about to embark on a political experiment whose outcome few could see, and many feared. They dismembered and finally discarded Humphreys&#x2019;s prolix draft and boiled down what Washington would say to the nation to essential ideas that every American could support. Drafting any address might have seemed like presumption on Washington&#x2019;s part: he was not yet president. Voting for presidential electors was still taking place in several states&#x2014;no citizen could cast a vote directly for president&#x2014;and the results could not be officially declared until Congress met. But since he had no opposition, the outcome was a foregone conclusion.<br> <br>The two men could hardly have been more dissimilar. At fifty-seven the aging war hero, a giant by the standards of his time, with his great beak of a nose, broad shoulders, and massive thighs that seemed to have been crafted by the Almighty to fit the back of a horse, was a living demigod. During the war, he had exhibited superhuman stoicism through the years of brutal winters, hunger, battlefield defeat, and civilian disaffection. He was also brave to the point of foolhardiness, repeatedly exposing himself to enemy fire; allegedly, at one point during the rout of American troops on Long Island, with a large rock in both hands, he was said to have stormed up to a boat filled with fleeing soldiers and threatened to &#x201c;sink it to hell&#x201d; unless the men went back to the fight. Popular writers commonly called him the nation&#x2019;s &#x201c;deliverer&#x201d; and &#x201c;savior&#x201d; and occasionally even likened him to Jesus Christ. &#x201c;O WASHINGTON! How do I love thy name!&#x201d; declared Ezra Stiles, the president of Yale University, in a widely reprinted sermon. &#x201c;How have I often adored and blessed thy God, for creating and forming thee the great ornament of human kind! Not all the gold of ophir, nor a world filled with rubies and diamonds, could effect or purchase the sublime and noble feelings of thine heart. Thy fame is of sweeter perfume than arabian spices in the gardens of persia.&#x201d; His face, which appeared everywhere&#x2014;on engravings, mezzotints, dinner plates, wall plaques, jugs, and mugs&#x2014;was probably the only one that was known to virtually every American. Although he had publicly professed &#x201c;the most unfeigned reluctance&#x201d; to take on the presidency, Washington was, as one New Englander put it, &#x201c;the only man which Man, Woman &amp; Child, Whig &amp; Tory, Fed&#x2019;s and Antifed&#x2019;s appear to agree in.&#x201d;<br> <br>Madison, twenty years Washington&#x2019;s junior, was respected in political circles for his scholarship and persuasive powers, but not much loved. Sickly and slight&#x2014;he stood five feet four and weighed only a hundred pounds&#x2014;and deemed &#x201c;unmanly&#x201d; by many of his contemporaries, it seemed as if all his vigor had been sucked into his copious and muscular mind. The wife of one prominent Virginia politician dismissed him as &#x201c;a gloomy, stiff creature&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the most unsociable creature in Existence.&#x201d; The two men had first met in 1781, when Madison was serving in the Continental Congress. Washington immediately recognized the Princeton-educated Madison as a young man of unusual talent. Although his wartime soldiering consisted only of a brief turn in the Virginia militia, his background in government was impressive. He had already served as a member of Virginia&#x2019;s revolutionary convention, and then&#x2014;still only in his midtwenties&#x2014;as a political adviser to Governor Patrick Henry, and to Henry&#x2019;s successor, Thomas Jefferson. After the war, as a member of the Virginia Assembly, Madison advocated for Washington&#x2019;s commercial interests in the Potomac Valley and became one of the former general&#x2019;s closest advisers.<br> <br>Although Madison spoke in a whispery, often-difficult-to-hear voice, and without oratorical flourish, he consistently impressed those who worked with him with his &#x201c;most ingenious mind,&#x201d; and his mastery of parliamentary strategy. He understood, as many of his more emotional colleagues did not, his biographer Richard Brookhiser acutely observed, that &#x201c;losing a vote was not the same as losing the argument, because if you could then write the guidelines for implementing the decision, you could nudge it in a better direction.&#x201d; It was a lesson well learned at the Constitutional Convention, where Madison had unsuccessfully proposed, among other things, that the president be chosen by the legislative branch rather than by a popular vote channeled through an electoral college, that Congress be given the power to override state laws, and that the membership of both houses of Congress be based on population. Madison would carry with him to the First Congress a disdain for Pyrrhic moral victories, and a pragmatic determination to make the imperfect machine of government work.<br> <br>Madison, more than any other man, had convinced the conflicted Washington first to attend the convention, and then to accept its chair. Washington would have preferred to remain at Mount Vernon beneath his &#x201c;vine and fig tree,&#x201d; his favorite euphemism for political disengagement, although he well knew that he could not remain so if the convention were to succeed. Though he shared Madison&#x2019;s anxiety for the country, he feared that he would be accused of selfish ambition if he reentered public life, having so publicly proclaimed his official retirement from it in 1783. Madison, however&#x2014;he was nothing if not persuasive, everyone agreed&#x2014;made the case that no other American had the prestige to win nationwide support for a radical overhaul of the hapless Confederation government. Once committed, Washington was unshakable. Jefferson observed of him, &#x201c;Perhaps the strongest feature in his character was prudence, never acting until every circumstance, every consideration, was maturely weighed; refraining if he saw a doubt, but, when once decided, going through with his purpose whatever obstacles opposed.&#x201d; As Madison had hoped, Washington&#x2019;s presence in Philadelphia helped to balance the discontent of those in the convention who felt that it was going too far in reinventing the government.<br> <br>Madison&#x2019;s reputation increased during the long campaign for ratification of the Constitution when, as a coauthor of The Federalist (with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay), he had laid out a reasoned case for a powerful central government, arguing that it would not weaken but strengthen personal liberties, and explaining to a doubtful public how its machinery would actually function. He boldly challenged the widely held belief that stable republics could work only in miniature societies, such as Greek city-states or homogeneous American communities. &#x201c;Latent causes of faction&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, individual self-interest&#x2014;he argued, was &#x201c;sown in the nature of man,&#x201d; and because it was inescapable, it had to be accommodated, not denied. This could best be accomplished in an extensive republic whose very diversity would prevent dangerous majorities from riding roughshod over political minorities, where it was less likely that any single party could outnumber and oppress the rest, and that a representative government rather than direct democracy would &#x201c;refine and enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country.&#x201d;<br> <br>Like many political men at the time, Madison believed that the legislature would long remain the most powerful branch of government, and the most likely to suck &#x201c;all power into its impetuous vortex.&#x201d; To restrain the legislature&#x2019;s greed for power, he maintained that all three branches of government had to be made equally vigorous and endowed with the &#x201c;means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others,&#x201d; to prevent an accumulation of legislative power that would inexorably lead to tyranny. Mere &#x201c;parchment barriers&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, well-meaning sentiments with no force to back them up&#x2014;would not be enough. Dividing Congress itself into two branches vested with different powers was just a first step. The greater challenge was empowering the two weaker branches of government&#x2014;the executive and judiciary&#x2014;to resist legislative dictatorship. To this end, the president had been given a veto to protect the independence of the executive branch, while lifetime tenure for members of the Supreme Court would help insulate the judiciary from political interference. &#x201c;Ambition must be made to counteract ambition,&#x201d; he declared, in a famous formulation. &#x201c;What is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary.&#x201d;<br> <br>As election results for the new Congress trickled in from the states&#x2014;there was no fixed day for elections&#x2014;the results proved vastly more favorable than Washington, Madison, and their fellow supporters of the new Constitution had hoped. Federalists had won overwhelming majorities in both houses of Congress. Americans, in Washington&#x2019;s opinion, had shown good sense, but the future remained fraught with risk. It might not take much to unravel the tentative fabric of a nation that had been rewoven at the Constitutional Convention less than two years earlier. &#x201c;Some unforeseen mischance,&#x201d; Washington worried, could still &#x201c;blast [our] enjoyment in the very bud.&#x201d;<br> <br>The pressure on Washington was immense, and public expectations so high that he could never fully satisfy them, he knew. The president-to-be had received any number of importunate pleas from men such as John Armstrong Jr., a former member of the Continental Congress, who had begged him &#x201c;to yield your services to the providential voice of God expressed in the voice of your country.&#x201d; (Armstrong may have been one of the less convincing voices, however: In 1783, he had been a central figure in the so-called Newburgh Conspiracy, which toyed with the idea of a military coup against the Congress.) So many conflicting worries tore at Washington, both political and personal: the unrest on the frontier and the financial instability in the states, the resurgence of the Constitution&#x2019;s opponents in Virginia, the planting schedules for his next season&#x2019;s crops of wheat and rye, the challenge of managing the remote lands he owned in the West, the declining health of his eighty-year-old mother, who was dying of cancer at Fredericksburg. And now he was about to shoulder the unprecedented burdens of the presidency. To his neighbor Samuel Vaughn he confessed, as he doubtless did to Madison, &#x201c;The event which I have long dreaded, I am at last constrained to believe, is now likely to happen. From the moment, when the necessity had become more apparent, &amp; as it were inevitable, I anticipated in a heart filled with distress, the ten thousand embarrassments, perplexities &amp; troubles to which I must again be exposed in the evening of a life, already near consumed in public cares.&#x201d;<br> <br>What was left of the old Confederation government was scheduled to cease functioning on March 3, and the new Congress to begin on March 4. But continuing wretched weather slowed Madison&#x2019;s northward progress to a crawl. From Baltimore, he wrote Washington the happy news, reported to him by a courier from Georgia, that Federalists had triumphed in that state&#x2019;s elections, too: &#x201c;All the Candidates I understand are well affected to the Constitution.&#x201d; But Madison&#x2019;s spirits sank a few days later at Philadelphia, when a traveler from New York told him that only a handful of senators and congressmen had arrived there, and that neither New Jersey nor New York had even completed their elections. (The traveler, a planter whom Madison trusted, also delivered the ominous news that British agents were active in the trans-Appalachian Kentucky district of Virginia, agitating against the American government, a development that Madison knew would have to be dealt with.) Much more worried Madison as well during the long, muddy journey to New York: the country&#x2019;s chaotic financial state&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the angry veterans who everywhere were demanding back pay&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the divisive debate raging over the site for a permanent federal capital&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the numerous amendments that roiling popular conventions had demanded be made to the Constitution, which might well undo all the work that Madison had done. He also knew that popular hopes for the new government were unrealistically high. &#x201c;The people,&#x201d; wrote one Massachusetts voter, &#x201c;are on tiptoe in their expectation from Congress, we expect more than Angells can do from your Body.&#x201d;<br> <br>From all over the eleven states that had approved the Constitution, newly elected members of Congress were heading, if glacially, toward New York. None of them knew with confidence whether they could rise to the demands of a new, untested government whose machinery they would have to invent as they went along. &#x201c;Leaving my domestick peace and hapiness and plungeing into the Ocean of Publick Business, Politicks, and Etiquette is unaccountable even to Myself But the fates will have it so,&#x201d; sighed Senator John Langdon of New Hampshire. Fisher Ames of Boston was so nervous at taking his seat in the House that it seemed like a kind of death. &#x201c;I am about to leave and renounce this world and go to New York and must so far settle my worldly affairs as to be in a degree prepared for my future state (a state of terror and uncertainty to me),&#x201d; he confided to a friend. One of Ames&#x2019;s traveling companions, the much more experienced Elbridge Gerry, hardly knew what to expect either.

In her second book, <i>Rachel Ashwell's Shabby Chic Treasure Hunting &amp; Decorating Guide</i>, Ashwell shares her processes, from a stall-by-stall description of a flea market trip to pictures of her design boards scattered with photos, fabric swatches, and paint chips. Ashwell doesn't skimp on details: she tells how to decide on a fair bargaining price at flea markets, how to clean old items without harming them, and (step by step) how one ugly glass-fronted cabinet topped with old linoleum and mismatched shelf paper became an attractive, roomy storage piece that houses her daughter's books, dolls, and bedding. This is a friendly, intimate book in which Ashwell shares pictures of her own home and those of her friends--some of whom live in roomy beach houses and some of whom live in 450-square-foot cottages, and all of whom use the main Shabby Chic concepts of comfort, function, and beauty in deciding which objects to share their space with. Fans of the original <i>Shabby Chic</i> will find this follow-up every bit as useful, attractive, and accessible.<p>Rachel Ashwell is the creator of the Shabby Chic style.

The overhead light was still on, and when he&#x2019;d collapsed on the couch, he&#x2019;d been too tired to get up and turn it off. The squeak wasn&#x2019;t so much consciously felt, as <i>understood</i>: he had a visitor. But nobody knocked.</p><p>Tubbs was a political.</p><p>In his case, political wasn&#x2019;t an adjective, but a noun. He didn&#x2019;t have a particular job, most of the time, though sometimes he did: an aide to this state senator or that one, a lobbyist for the Minnesota Association of Whatever, a staffer for so-and-so&#x2019;s campaign. So-and so was almost always a Democrat.</p><p>He&#x2019;d started with Jimmy Carter in &#x2019;76, when he was eighteen, stayed pure until he jumped to the Jesse Ventura gubernatorial revolt in &#x2019;98, and then it was back to the Democrats. He&#x2019;d never done anything else.</p><p>He was a political; and frequently, a fixer.</p><p>Occasionally, a bagman.</p><p>Several times&#x2014;like just now&#x2014;a nervous, semi-competent black mailer.</p><br><br><p>Tubbs slept, usually, in the smaller of his two bedrooms. The other was a chaotic offi ce, the floor stacked with position papers and reports and magazines, with four overflowing file cabinets against one wall. An Apple iMac sat in the middle of his desk, surrounded by more stacks of paper. A disassembled Mac Pro body and a cinema screen hunkered on the floor to one side of the desk, along with an abandoned Sony desktop. Boxes of old three-and-a-half-inch computer disks sat on bookshelves over the radiator. They&#x2019;d been saved by simple negligence: he no longer knew what was on any of them.</p><p>The desk had four drawers. One was taken up with current employment and tax files, and the others were occupied by office junk: envelopes, stationery, yellow legal pads, staplers, rubber bands, thumb drives, Post-it notes, scissors, several pairs of fingernail clippers, Sharpies, business cards, dozens of ballpoints, five or six coffee cups from political campaigns and lobbyist groups, tangles of computer connectors.</p><p>He had two printers, one a heavy-duty Canon office machine, the other a Brother multiple-use copy/fax/scan/print model.</p><p>There were three small thirty-inch televisions in his office, all fastened to the wall above the desk, so he could work on the iMac and watch C-SPAN, Fox, and CNN all at once. A sixty-inch LED screen hung on the living room wall opposite the couch where he&#x2019;d been napping.</p><p><i>Squeak.</i></p><p>This time he opened his eyes.</p><br><br><p>Tubbs reached out for his cell phone, punched the button on top, checked the time: three-fifteen in the morning. He&#x2019;d had any number of visitors at three-fifteen, but to get through the apartment house&#x2019;s front door, they had to buzz him. He frowned, sat up, listening, smacked his lips; his mouth tasted like a chicken had been roosting in it, and the room smelled of cold chili.</p><p>Then his doorbell blipped: a quiet <i>ding-dong</i>. Not the buzzer from outside, which was a raucous <i>ZZZZTTT</i>, but the doorbell. Tubbs dropped his feet off the couch, thinking, <i>Neighbor</i>. Had to be Mrs. Thomas R. Jefferson. She sometimes got disoriented at night, out looking for her deceased husband, and several times had locked herself out of her own apartment.</p><p>Tubbs padded across the floor in his stocking feet. There was nothing tubby about Tubbs: he was a tall man, and thin. Though he&#x2019;d lived a life of fund-raising dinners and high-stress campaigns, he&#x2019;d ignored the proffered sheet cake, Ding Dongs, Pepsi, Mr. Goodbars, and even the odd moon pies, as well as the stacks of Hungry-Man microwave meals found in campaign refrigerators. A vegetarian, he went instead for the soy-based proteins, the non-fat cereals, and the celery sticks. If he found himself cornered at a church-basement dinner, he looked for the Jell-O with shredded carrots and onions, and those little pink marshmallows.</p><p>Tubbs had blond hair, still thick as he pushed into his fifties, a neatly cropped mustache, and a flat belly. Given his habits and his diet, he figured his life expectancy was about ninety-six. Maybe ninety-nine.</p><p>One big deficit: he hadn&#x2019;t had a regular woman since his third wife departed five years earlier. On the other hand, the irregular women came along often enough&#x2014;campaign volunteers, legislative staff, the occasional lobbyist. He had always been a popular man, a man with political stories that were funny, generally absurd, and sometimes terrifying. He told them well.</p><p>As he walked toward the door, he scratched his crotch. His dick felt sort of . . . bent. Chafed. A little swollen.</p><p>The latest irregular woman was more irregular than most.</p><p>They&#x2019;d had a strenuous workout earlier that evening, a day that had left Tubbs exhausted. Hours of cruising the media outlets, talking to other operators all over the state, assessing the damage; a tumultuous sexual encounter; and finally, the biggest blackmail effort of his life, the biggest potential payoff . . .</p><p>He was beat, which was why, perhaps, he wasn&#x2019;t more suspicious.</p><p>Tubbs checked the peephole. Nobody there. <i>Probably Mrs. Jefferson</i>, he thought, who hadn&#x2019;t been five-two on her tallest day, and now was severely bent by osteoporosis.</p><p>He popped open the door, and,</p><p><i>Surprise! </i></p><br><br><p>Tubbs regained consciousness on the floor of a moving car, an SUV. He was terribly injured, and knew it. He no longer knew exactly how it had happened, if he ever had, but there was something awfully wrong with his head, his skull. His face and hands were wet with blood, and he could taste blood in his mouth and his nose was stuffed with it. He would have gagged if he had the strength.</p><p>He could move his hands, but not his feet, and with a little clarity that came after a while, he knew something else: he was lying on a plastic sheet. And he knew why: so the floor of the car wouldn&#x2019;t get blood on it.</p><p>The images in his mind were confused, but deep down, in a part that hadn&#x2019;t been impacted, he knew who his attackers must be, and he knew what the end would be. He&#x2019;d be killed. And he was so hurt that he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to fight it.</p><p>Tubbs was dying. There wasn&#x2019;t much in the way of pain, because he was too badly injured for that. Nothing to do about it but wait until the darkness came.</p><p>The car was traveling on a smooth road, and its gentle motion nevertheless suggested speed. A highway, headed out of St. Paul. Going to a burial ground, or maybe to the Mississippi. He had no preference. A few minutes after he regained consciousness, he slipped away again.</p><p>Then he resurfaced, and deep down in the lizard part of his brain, a spark of anger burned. Nothing he could do? A plan formed, not a good one, but something. Something he could actually do. His hands were damp with blood. With much of his remaining life force, he pushed one wet hand across the plastic sheet, and tried as best he could to form the letters TG.</p><p>That was it. That was all he had. A scrawl of blood on the underside of a car seat, where the owner wouldn&#x2019;t see it, but where a crime-scene technician might.</p><p>He pulled his hand back and then felt his tongue crawl out of his mouth, beyond his will, the muscles of his face relaxing toward death.</p><p>He was still alive when the car slowed, and then turned. Still alive when it slowed again, and this time, traveled down a rougher road. Felt the final turn, and the car rocking to a stop. Car doors opening.</p><p>His killers pulled him out of the backseat by pulling and lifting th plastic tarp on which he lay. One of them said, &#x201c;Skinny fuck is heavy.&#x201d;</p><p>The other answered, &#x201c;Hey. I think he&#x2019;s breathing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah? Give me the bat.&#x201d;</p><p>Just before the darkness came, Tubbs sensed the fetid wetness of a swamp; an odor, a softness in the soil beneath his body. He never heard or felt the crunch of his skull shattering under the bat.</p><p>Nothingness.</p><br><br><p><b>CHAPTER 2 </b></p><p>Lucas Davenport was having his hockey nightmare, the one where he is about to take the ice in an NCAA championship game, but can&#x2019;t find his skates. He knows where they are&#x2014; locker 120&#x2014;but the locker numbers end at 110 down one aisle, and pick up at 140 on the next one.</p><p>He knows 120 is somewhere in the vast locker room, and as the time ticks down to the beginning of the match, and the fan-chants start from the bleachers overhead, he runs frantically barefoot up and down the rows of lockers, scanning the number plates. . . .</p><p>He knew he was dreaming even as he did it. He wanted nothing more than to end it, which was why he was struggling toward consciousness at eight o&#x2019;clock on a Sunday morning and heard Weather chortling in the bathroom.</p><p>Weather, his wife, was a surgeon, and on working days was always out of the house by six-thirty. Even on sleep-in days, she hardly ever slept until eight. Lucas, on the other hand, was a night owl. He was rarely in bed before two o&#x2019;clock, except for recreational purposes, and he was content to sleep until nine o&#x2019;clock, or later.</p><p>This morning, he could hear her laughing in the bathroom, and realized that she was watching the built-in bathroom TV as she put on her makeup. She&#x2019;d resisted the idea of a bathroom television, but Lucas had installed one anyway, claiming that it would increase their efficiency&#x2014;get the local news out of the way, so they could start their days.</p><p>In reality, it had more to do with shaving. He&#x2019;d started shaving when he was fifteen, and had never had a two-week beard. Even counting the rare days when he hadn&#x2019;t shaved for one reason or another, he&#x2019;d still gone through the ritual at least twelve thousand times, and he enjoyed it. Took his time with it. Found that the television added to the whole ceremony.</p><p>Now, as he struggled to the surface, and out of the hockey arena, he called, &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>She called back, &#x201c;More on Smalls. The guy is truly fucked.&#x201d;</p><p>Lucas said, &#x201c;Have a good day,&#x201d; and rolled over and tried to find a better dream, preferably involving twin blondes with long plaited hair and really tight, round . . . ZZZ.</p><p>Just before he went back to dreamland, he thought about Weather&#x2019;s choice of words. She didn&#x2019;t use obscenity lightly, but in this case, she was correct: Smalls was really, truly fucked.</p><br><br><p>Lucas Davenport was tall, heavy-shouldered, and hawk-faced, and, at the end of the first full month of autumn, still well-tanned, which made his blue eyes seem bluer yet, and made a couple of white scars stand out on his face and neck. The facial scar was thin, like a piece of pale fishing line strung down over his eyebrow and onto one cheek. The neck scar, centered on his throat, was circular with a vertical slash through it. Not one he liked to remember: the young girl had pulled the piece-of-crap .22 out of nowhere and shot him and would have killed him if Weather hadn&#x2019;t been there with a jackknife. The vertical slash was the result of the tracheotomy that had saved his life. The slug had barely missed his spinal cord.</p><p>The tan would be fading over the next few months, and the scars would become almost invisible until, in March, he&#x2019;d be as pale as a piece of typing paper.</p><br><br><p>Lucas rolled out of bed at nine o&#x2019;clock, spent some time with himself in the bathroom, and caught a little more about Porter Smalls.</p><p>Smalls was a conservative Republican politician. Lucas generally didn&#x2019;t like right-wingers, finding them generally to be self-righteous and uncompromising. Smalls was more relaxed than that. He was conservative, especially on the abortion issue, and he was death on taxes; on the other hand, he had a Clintonesque attitude about women, and even a sense of humor about his own peccadilloes. Minnesotans went for his whole bad-boy act, especially in comparison to the stiffs who usually got elected to high office.</p><p>Smalls was rich. As someone at the Capitol once told Lucas, he&#x2019;d started out selling apples. The first one he bought for a nickel, and sold for a quarter. With the quarter, he bought five more apples, and sold them for a dollar. Then he inherited twenty million dollars from his father, and became an overnight success.</p><p>Weather loathed Smalls because he advocated Medicaid cuts as a way to balance the state budget. He was also virulently pro-life, and Weather was strongly pro-choice. He was also anti-union, and wanted to eliminate all public employee unions with a federal law. &#x201c;Conflict of interest,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Payoffs with taxpayer money.&#x201d;</p><p>Lucas paid little attention to it. He generally voted for Democrats, but not always. He&#x2019;d voted for a nominally Republican governor, not once but twice. Whatever happened, he figured he could live with it.</p><br><br><p>Anyway, Smalls had looked like he was headed for reelection over an attractive young Minnesota heiress, though it was going to be close. Her qualifications for office were actually better than Smalls&#x2019;s; she looked terrific, and had an ocean of money. If she had a problem, it was that she carried with her a whiff of arrogance and entitlement, and maybe more than a whiff .</p><p>Then, on the Friday before, a dewy young volunteer, as conservative as Smalls himself, and with the confidence that comes from being both dewy and affluent&#x2014;it seemed like everybody involved in the election had money&#x2014;had gone into Smalls&#x2019;s campaign office to drop off some numbers on federal aid to Minnesota for bridge construction, also known as U.S. Government Certified A-1 Pork.</p><p>She told the cops that Smalls&#x2019;s computer screen was blanked out when she walked into the office. She wanted him to see the bridge files as soon as he came in, so she put them on his keyboard.</p><p>When the packets hit the keyboard, the screen lit up . . . with a kind of child porn so ugly that the young woman hardly knew what she was seeing for the first few seconds. Then she did what any dewy Young Republican would have done: she called her father. He told her to stay where she was: he&#x2019;d call the police.</p><p>When the cops arrived, they took one look, and seized the computer.</p><p>And somebody, maybe everybody, blabbed to the media.</p><p>Porter Smalls was in the shit.</p><p>Sunday morning, a time for newspapers and kids: Lucas pulled on a pair of blue jeans, a black shirt, and low-cut black boots. When he was done, he admired himself in Weather&#x2019;s full-length admiring mirror, brushed an imaginary flake from his shoulder, and went down to French toast and bacon, which he could smell sizzling on the griddle even on the second floor.</p><p>The housekeeper, Helen, was passing it all around when he sat down. His son, Sam, a toddler, was babbling about trucks, and had three of them on the table; Letty was talking about a fashion- forward girl who&#x2019;d worn a tiara to high school, in a kind of make-or-break status move; Weather was reading a <i>Times</i> review about some artist who&#x2019;d spent five years doing a time-lapse movie of grass growing and dying; and Baby Gabrielle was throwing oatmeal at the refrigerator.</p><p>There were end-of-the-world headlines about Smalls, in both the Minneapolis and New York papers. The <i>Times</i>, whose editorial portentousness approached traumatic constipation, tried to suppress its glee under the bushel basket of feigned sadness that another civil servant had been caught in a sexual misadventure; th...</p></p><h2>My Bonny Light Horseman: Being an Account of the Further Adventures of Jacky Faber, in Love and War (Bloody Jack Adventures)</h2><p>The infamous pirate, riverboat seductress, master of disguise, and street-urchin-turned-sailor Jacky Faber has been captured by the French and beheaded in full view of her friends and crew.Inconceivable?

Arabella Boxer&#39;s Book of English Food describes the delicious dishes - and the social conditions in which they were prepared, cooked and eaten - in the short span between the two World Wars when English cooking suddenly blossomed. The food in these wonderful recipes comes from the great country houses, where little had changed since Victorian times, the large houses in London and the South, where fashionable hostesses vied with each other to entertain the most distinguished guests at their tables, and less grand establishments, like those in Bloomsbury where the painters and writers of the day contrived to lead cultured and civilised lives on little money. Containing 200 recipes, drawn from cookery books, magazines of the period, family sources or from talking to survivors who still remember those days, A Book of English Food is a fascinating glimpse into another world, and a celebration of English cooking at its finest. &#39;That rare thing, a cookery book with an argument: viz, that English cookery was once both good and independent of the cuisines of her neighbours . . . a rollicking good read&#39; Observer &#39;I still find the calm elegance of her writing an inspiration&#39; Nigel Slater &#39;A treasury of social gossip . . . immensely enjoyable and useful&#39; Spectator &#39;A captivating exploration and celebration of the flowering of English cooking in the 1920s and 30s&#39; Financial Times &#39;I recommend it, not only for its excellent food but also for the superb introductions and details of social history in the great houses with their shimmering hostesses&#39; Evening Standard Arabella Boxer was born in 1934 and educated in the UK, Paris and Rome.

Clarke's <i>The Sentinel</i> offers insight and commentary on 10 of Clarke's most notable short stories.<p> In Clarke's introduction, he explores why he became the kind of writer he did, and he offers a look at the very first paragraph he ever published--in 1933. This anthology spans three decades, beginning in 1946 with the second story he published, "The Rescue Party," and offers a chance to read some of the short stories that later germinated into his most spectacular works.</p><p> It's a special treat to be able to see the beginnings of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> and <i>Childhood's End</i>, along with Clarke's thoughts on how each story came about. The truly amazing thing is that Clarke's short fiction still holds up, by and large. It's unavoidable that time would catch up with Clarke, though. In fact, he almost apologetically reminds the reader that while "Jupiter V" is dated, Sputnik was still six years in the future when it was written in 1951.</p><p> While it would have been wonderful if Clarke had added an additional introduction about the human race's journey into 2001 and beyond for this special edition, that was not to be. His most recent words in this anthology were written in 1983. But that's a minor quibble. With exceptional illustrations by Lebbeus Woods, <i>The Sentinel</i> is a must-read, not only for Clarke fans, but for all readers of science fiction. <i>--Kathie Huddleston</i></p>Few masters of science fiction have brought us glimpses of the near future as vividly as Arthur C. Clarke. It is the startling realism of his vision that has made classics of his Childhood's End and 2001: A Space Odyssey -- and Clarke himself one of the genre's most successful writers.<p>To commemorate the fast-approaching arrival of one of the most notable dates in science fiction history comes this special anniversary edition of The Sentinel, a brilliant collection of Clarke's highest caliber short fiction. Among the ten stories included in this volume are: </p><p>"The Sentinel": The story that inspired 2001: A Space Odyssey, one of the most famous SF movies of all time</p><p>"Guardian Angel": The rarely-glimpsed work that gave birth to Childhood's End</p><p>"The Songs of Distant Earth": A fantastic tale of first contact with an alien world, which became the basis for one of Clarke's most successful novels</p><p>"Breaking Strain": The inspiration for the popular book series Arthur C.

With Criminal, they&#x2019;ve escaped superheroes altogether, if only to adhere slavishly&#x2014;but rewardingly&#x2014;to another genre, hard-boiled noir. In this arc, insomniac cartoonist Jacob Kurtz&#x2019;s nocturnal excursions lead him to a fateful encounter in a seedy diner with an alluring redhead and her psychotically violent boyfriend, who ensnare him in an ill-advised heist. Jacob is damaged goods; he never recovered, physically or psychologically, from being framed by the police for murdering his wife and beaten by her mobbed-up relatives. The noose around him tightens; his obsession with the redhead grows; and in true noir fashion, he becomes increasingly desperate and unhinged (he receives visitations from his strip&#x2019;s Dick Tracy&#x2013;ish protagonist, Frank Kafka, PI). This all leads to an appropriately twisted denouement. Brubaker brings to Criminal the same intricate plotting and gritty dialogue that distinguished his earlier comics, and emphasizing mood and character plays to Phillips&#x2019; considerable strengths. The shadowy, dangerous world of Criminal is hauntingly convincing. Criminal&#x2019;s among the best mainstream comics produced today. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>From Here to There: A Curious Collection from the Hand Drawn Map Association</h2><p>It's a situation we are all acquainted with: planning to visit friends in an unfamiliar part of the city, you draw yourself arudimentary map with detailed directions. In March 2008, graphic designer Kris Harzinski founded the Hand Drawn Map Association in order to collect just such drawings of the everyday. Fascinated by these accidental records of a moment in time, he soon amassed a wide variety of maps, ranging from simple directions to fictional maps, to maps of unusual places, including examples drawn by well-known historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, Ernest Shackleton, and Alexander Calder. <br><br><em>From Here to There</em> celebrates these ephemeral documentsusually forgotten or tossed aside after having served their purposegiving them their due as artifacts representing stories from people's lives around the world. There is the young woman suffering from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis who created maps of the Humira injections on her stomach and thighs to help her remember the sites, and give them time to heal. Or the young boy who imagined a whole country for ants and put it to paper. Lucas from Australia drew an obsessively detailed map of his local traffic island, and a teenage girl contributed a map of her high school locker. Two American tourists got lost in the Bulgarian mountains following the hand drawn map of a local, and Britanny from Denmark drew directions to an animal rights protest in Copenhagen. The maps featured in <em>From Here to There</em> are as varied and touching as the stories they tell.</p><p>Kris Harzinski runs a graphic design studio called Free Design in Lancaster, Pennsylvania."I love that at the time they were drawn, these maps were useful and meant to explain something.

One of America&#x2019;s most celebrated cartoonists, Crumb helped define cartoon and punk subcultures of the 1960s and 1970s with comic strips like Fritz the Cat, Mr. Natural, and Keep on Truckin&#x2019;. The open sexuality of his work, paired with frequent self-deprecation and a free, almost stream-of-consciousness style, has made Crumb into a global voice and a renowned contemporary artist. Originally published in France in 1986 by Futuropolis, the first edition of Bible of Filth was never distributed in the United States because of its graphic sexual content, which included some of Crumb&#x2019;s most explicit comics from underground magazines such as Snatch, Jiz, Zap, XYZ, Big Ass, and Uneeda. This revised and expanded English edition, published by David Zwirner Books, contains all the original pieces from the 1986 volume, with over one hundred pages of additional material. Organized chronologically, there are comics from 1968 to 1986 that were omitted from the first edition and an entirely new selection of work from after 1986. Printed on bible paper and bound in leather, with gold debossing and edging, this volume looks and feels like a traditional bible, with no outward suggestion of what it contains. This revised and expanded Bible of Filth is the perfect introduction for newcomers, while retaining its status as an important collector&#x2019;s item for Crumb enthusiasts around the world.</p><p>Born in Philadelphia in 1943, R. Crumb has used the popular medium of the comic book to address the absurdity of social conventions, political disillusionment, irony, racial and gender stereotypes, sexual fantasies, and fetishes. Inspired by Thomas Nast, Honor� Daumier, T.S. Sullivant, and James Gillray, amongst others, his drawings offer a satirical critique of modern consumer culture and seem to possess an outsider&#x2019;s perspective&#x2014;a self-conscious stance, which Crumb often relates to his personal life.</p><h2>Dondi White Style Master General: The Life of Graffiti Artist Dondi White</h2><p><p>"In the beginning, there was the Word. On the streets and in the yards, the word was the Name. And the name was everything. It was persona and place, form and content, truth and fiction. The name was an act of self-invention, a pure visual manifestation, through alter ego, alias, and nom de plume, of personal expressions in the public realm. The name was a line and the line begat the Mark. Then, in the great style wars toward the end of the second millennium, medium, meaning, and message were joined in a golden era where the name became the source and signifier of Style. And when the name became wild style, the word was Dondi."</p><p>-- from the Foreword</p><p>The dominance of the graffiti aesthetic in contemporary culture is undeniable. But how did an art form spawned in the train yards of 1970s New York achieve the ubiquity it now enjoys at every level of the mass-media landscape? There are many answers to the question, but one major factor is indisputable: Dondi White.</p><p>Coming of age in hardscrabble East New York in the early 1970s, Dondi White unknowingly began the process of introducing a whole new artistic dialect into the cacophony of the American art scene. His train pieces painted from roughly 1977 to 1982 stand as some of the most influential works ever committed to Transit Authority steel. Writing with legendary partners such as DURO, NOC 167, KID 56, KEL 139, and FUZZ ONE, Dondi created some of graffiti art's most enduring iconography. His pieces just don't stop -- and neither do the aliases. From the badass Mr. Whites to the cocky, self-satisfied Busses, from the nasty Pres to the perfect, vicious Rolls, Dondi straight killed it, again and again. Works like <em>Children of the Grave Part 2</em> and <em>Mr White + Bev</em> remain benchmark pieces for graffiti aficionados the world over.</p><p>In the 1980s, partially through his collaborations with noted photographers Henry Chalfant and Martha Cooper, Dondi White's work entered the rarefied world of fine art. In making the transition from subway car to canvas, Dondi retained his unfaltering sense of letter form and balance, and his paintings remain a testament to the clarity of his aesthetic. Dondi's canvases were subsequently shown in galleries from New York to Amsterdam to Tokyo and beyond, influencing a new generation of young artists and introducing an indigenous American art form to the rest of the world.</p><p><em>Dondi White: Style Master General</em> presents the life and work of a seminal -- yet heretofore overlooked -- American artist whose work has resonated on every level of our popular culture. Filled with rare photographs, original sketches, unpublished interview materials, and testimony from some of Dondi's closest cohorts, here, finally, is the full story. At the time of his death in 1998, Dondi had seen the majority of his work destroyed -- scraped off, painted over, or chemically removed from the steel upon which it thrived. Within these pages, however, it still speaks volumes.</p></p><p>Andrew Witten--aka Zephyr--has been referred to by the <em>New York Times</em> as "the elder statesman of New York graffiti." He was an integral of the graffiti art movement of the early 80s as a member of the Fun Gallery, whose artists also included Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kenny Scharf, and Keith Haring. His work has been exhibited extensively throughout Europe and Asia, and a number of his paintings reside in the permanent collections of the Boymans and Groninger museums, among others. He currently runs his own firm, Zephyr Designs, here in New York City.Nearly 20 years after the art world began to consider graffiti a contender, one of its most acclaimed progenitors from the '70s and '80s is honored in a retrospective called DONDI Style Master General: The Life and Art of Dondi White by Andrew Witten and Michael White. Raised in Brooklyn's East New York neighborhood, White was part of an active culture of graffiti "writers": "Dondi and his generation perfected the energetic, edgy, probing styles of their predecessors, learning control, fitting the painting to the car/canvas." Gifted with vision, purpose and talent, White also stood out for crossing boundaries within graffiti-artist and gang culture. Photographers Martha Cooper and Henry Chalfant made his work visible to the art world and had a hand in transforming subway-art culture in the process.

With wonderful additions by Sarah Raven, a famous British gardener in her own right who is married to Vita's grandson Adam Nicolson, <i>Sissinghurst</i> draws on this extraordinary archive, revealing Vita's most loved flowers, as well as offering practical advice for gardeners. Often funny and completely accessibly written with color and originality, it also describes details of the trials and tribulations of crafting a place of beauty and elegance.</p><p>Sissinghurst has gone on to become one of the most visited and inspirational gardens in the world and this marvellous book, illustrated with drawings and original photographs throughout, shows us how it was created and how gardeners everywhere can use some of the ideas from both Sarah Raven and Vita Sackville-West. <i>Sissinghurst </i>is a magnificent portrait of a garden and a family.</p></p><p><p>VITA SACKVILLE-WEST was born in 1892 in Kent. A distinguished critic, biographer, award-winning poet and gardener, she also published twelve novels, including <i>All Passion Spent</i> and <i>The Edwardians</i>. Her relationship with Virginia Woolf is celebrated in Woolf's novel <i>Orlando</i>, and the story of her life with Harold Nicolson, one of the strangest and happiest love stories, was portrayed in <i>Portrait of a Marriage</i> by their son Nigel Nicolson. She died at Sissinghurst, aged seventy, in 1962.</p><p>SARAH RAVEN, writer, cook, broadcaster and teacher, runs cooking, flower arranging, growing and gardening courses at the school she set up in 1999 at her farm in East Sussex. She has written three cookbooks, as well as <i>Wild Flowers</i> and four gardening books, including <i>The Cutting Garden</i>.

This title is suitable for ages 4-8.</p><p>Robert Frost, the quintessential poet of New England, was actually born in San Francisco in 1874. He was educated at Dartmouth College and Harvard University. Although he managed to support himself working solely as a poet for most of his life and holding various posts with a number of universities, as a young man he was employed as a bobbin boy in a mill, a cobbler, a schoolteacher, and a farmer. Frost, whose poetry focuses on natural images of New England, received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry four times; for New Hampshire, Collected Poems, A Further Range, and A Witness Tree. His work is noted for combining characteristics of both romanticism and modernism. He also wrote A Boy&#39;s Will, North of Boston, Mountain Interval, and The Gift Outright, among others. Frost married Elinor Miriam White in 1895, and they had six children--Elliott, Lesley, Carol, Irma, Marjorie, and Elinor Bettina. He died in Boston in 1963.Clifton Fadiman narrates this selection with his rich, yet melodic voice and gives life to the short poems of this well-known poet. The pace is slow enough to savor the words and implications, yet it moves along to maintain the continuity of thought. An occasional sound effect pertinent to the poem, such as bells or birds, brings additional life to the presentation. Adults will appreciate the introduction. If children of elementary age are to appreciate and enjoy this, the book should be used with the tape. This would be an excellent choice for a family auto trip. P.L.

Like author Simon Chase, many PMCs were once the world's top military operatives, and since retiring from outfits like US Navy SEAL TEAM Six and the UK's Special Boat Service, they have devoted their lives to executing sensitive and hazardous missions overseas.<br><br>Working at the request of U.S. and British government entities as well as for private clients, he takes on jobs that require "zero footprint," with no trace of their actions left behind.<br><br>Chase delivers first-hand accounts of tracking Bin Laden in Afghanistan and being one of the first responders after the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi. We see his teams defuse terrorist bombs, guard dignitaries, and protect convoys traveling through perilous territory--and then there are the really big jobs: top-secret "zero footprint" missions that include searching for High Value Targets and setting up arms shipping networks.<br><br>The missions in <i>Zero Footprint</i> will shock readers, but so will the personal dangers. Chase and the men he works with operate without government backup or air rescue. If they die serving their country--they remain anonymous. There are no military honors or benefits. Contractors like Simon Chase are the unsung heroes in the war against terrorism, a strong, but largely invisible force--until now.</p><p>Simon Chase is the pen name of a former member of the elite Royal Marine Commandos. He was recruited into the British Special Forces, serving in the Special Boat Squadron (SBS). While there he carried out top secret missions around the world working alongside the CIA and DEA. More recently, he has worked with a close-knit team of U.S. Special Forces operatives to provide high-level protection and intervention services for individuals, corporations and governments all over the globe."<em>Zero Footprint</em> reveals an intimate and visceral look at the life of a Private Military Contractor (PMCs) and the perilous missions that the author and others were so often assigned. This gripping story superbly chronicles the life of Simon Chase, former Royal Marine Commando and Special Boat Squadron operator. Chase's incredible story will leave its readers with a true appreciation and respect for the training and missions these so called "shadowy figures," the "unsung invisible force" simply known as PMCs, were so often assigned."&#x2015;<b><i>Don D. Mann, SEAL Team SIX (ret.), and author of <em>Inside SEAL Team SIX</em></i></b><br><br>"<i>Zero Footprint</i> is a gut-wrenching look into a necessary evil in the war on terror. It may offend your sensibilities, but sometimes you have to fight fire with fire. I sit in no judgment of these highly skilled warriors as I have seen the beast that they are up against."&#x2015;<b><i>Howard Wasdin, author of S<em>eal Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy Seal Sniper</em></i></b><br><br>"From the mountains of Tora Bora to the mean streets of Baghdad and Benghazi, Simon Chase has fought in the shadow places of this earth and lived to tell the tale. <i>Zero Footprint</i> is his harrowing story, intense, frightening, and eventually heart-breaking. One of the best counter-terror memoirs I've ever read."&#x2015;<b><i>Chuck Pfarrer, SEAL Team Six Assault Element Commander, and author of <em>Philip Nolan: The Man Without a Country</em></i></b><br><br>"Absorbing . . . Well-wrought and exciting . . . A well-developed look inside the life and work of an accomplished private military contractor."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></i></b><br><br>"The life of a private security contractor is a life like no other. The careers of the operators described in the powerful and fascinating <i>Zero Footprint</i> can only happen after they have graduated from a successful career inside a Special Forces of the top militaries in the world. They fill a special space that requires their unique skills. If arrested in one of their missions, there is no Geneva Convention, there are no diplomatic immunity protections, and their employer will most likely deny they know them. Simon Chase and Ralph Pezzullo have written an exciting account of a career reserved only for a few of the finest in the world. It's an excellent book!"&#x2015;<b><i>Joel Vargas, Assistant Director for Law Enforcement Operations &amp; Head of Intelligence, International Association of Airport &amp; Seaport Police (InterPort Police)</i></b><br><br>"As a twenty-four year veteran of the Green Berets and twelve years as a private military contractor, I can tell you that <i>Zero Footprint</i> is an accurate, exciting, no-holds-barred account of the often grey and very dangerous world of private military contracting. Simon Chase has fought on the front lines in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Libya, and lived to talk about it. His account of the secret mission he ran in Benghazi is chilling and sure to create headlines. I recommend this important book by Simon Chase and Ralph Pezzullo to anyone interested in how war is actually waged in today's world."&#x2015;<b><i>Retired US Special Forces Master Sergeant Changiz Lahidji</i></b></p><h2>The Ground We Share: Everyday Practice, Buddhist and Christian</h2><p>These dialogues between Robert Aitken Roshi, one of the first American-born Zen masters, and Brother David Steindl-Rast, the Roman Catholic monk and hermit, took place during a week-long retreat the two old friends undertook in 1991 in a remote part of the island of Hawaii. Their aim was to approach the dialogue between Buddhism and Christianity in a fresh way, one that takes as its starting point a comparison of the personal experiences of the dialoguers&#x2014;as a Buddhist and as a Christian, respectively&#x2014;rather than abstract concepts. The result is the discovery of a surprising amount of common ground&#x2014;the kind of shared experience that forms a solid foundation for further dialogue.</p><p>Brother David Steindl-Rast, O.S.B., is the author of <i>A Listening Heart, </i> <i>The Music of Silence, </i> and, with Fritjof Capra, <i>Belonging to the Universe: Explorations on the Frontier of Science and Spirituality. </i>"This is a lovely, engaging, insightful conversation between two important contemporary spiritual teachers and practitioners, one (Aitken) an American-born Zen master and the other (Steindl-Rast) a Benedictine monk. The conversation is drawn from a week-long retreat that Aitkin and Steindl-Rast shared in Hawaii in 1991. They agree quickly to focus on 'everyday practice' rather than on abstract conceptions of Buddhism and Christianity. The result is not a formal contribution to the growing body of Buddhist-Christian dialogue so much as an illuminating and multifaceted exploration of common ground&#x2014;the sacred heart that beats at the center of a world shared by Christians and Buddhists. This volume offers a rare opportunity to eavesdrop on a conversation between compassionate believers comfortable with their differences, fully engaged with each other, and fully engaged in the world."&#x2014;Steve Schroeder, <i>Booklist</i><br>"This book is important, not because it advances any broad ecumenical agendas, but because Buddhism has become an important element in the American intellectual landscpae, and most 'New World' Buddhist practitioners have their roots in either the Jewish or the Christian tradition. <i>The Ground We Share </i> is valuable proof that equanimity and honesty must form the common ground of dialogue."&#x2014;Scott Whitney, <i>Parabola</i></p><h2>The Atlas of Pern: A Complete Guide to Anne McCaffrey&#39;s Wonderful World of Dragons and Dragonriders</h2><p>Combines descriptive entries with detailed maps and schematics to provide a comprehensive guide to the geography, history, and inhabitants of Anne McCaffrey&#39;s fabulous world of dragons and dragonriders</p><p></p><h2>The Parasol Protectorate (3-in-1) Soulless, Changeless, Blameless (Alexia Tarabotti, Omnibus 1-3)</h2><p>Soulless: Alexia Tarabotti has three strikes against her: She&#39;s a spinster.

The bucks went mostly for water, but a considerable amount was consumed by fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides, spring and fall top-dressing, a bag or two of seed to spruce up bare areas and a few rolls of sod to replace grass consumed by white grubs. </p><p> As he unloaded lawn-care supplies from his trunk after a visit to the local nursery on Saturday mornings, my neighbor would laugh about his obsession to anyone within hearing distance, poking a little fun at himself. But his jokes were telling. He was inordinately proud of his lawn, and spent hours cutting or grooming it. He tended to its every complaint with the attention of a doting mother to a sick child. I doubt if our neighbor ever figured out exactly how much his thick carpet of turf cost. It remained lush and deep green all season, despite grass's tendency to become dormant in mid-summer, and in spite of the occasional all-season drought. Drought he considered nature's biggest challenge, an occasion to rise to with the fervor of a warrior whose turf, literally, had been invaded. He and his grass always triumphed. The texture was always soft, with blades thicker than the tufts in my new plush broadloom. His lawn was so perfect that the kids in the neighborhood preferred it to their jungle gyms for afternoon play. Our neighbor -- a kind man, really -- gritted his teeth and looked the other way as they somersaulted and tumbled on its velvety surface. His lawn was a prized possession he'd rather admire than use. </p><p> Even in my naive youth I suspected our neighbor was lording it over us. But this was the fifties, and the lawn was king. The rest of us on the street, newly married suburbanites with our first homes, actually envied him -- he'd reached a level of lawn nirvana we couldn't yet achieve, but we would one day. We couldn't imagine it any other way. </p><p> Were lawns the law? They might as well have been. At the very least there was an unwritten rule that grass would be the feature of the front yard, backed by evergreen foundation plantings and maybe a shade tree in the center of the lawn. Neighbors with patchy or unmown grass were frowned upon, or worse. The unspoken threat of a call to the bylaw officer always hung in the air. The appearance of a single dandelion made us shudder and offer to loan the culprit a can of our most lethal herbicide -- after all, we had standards to uphold. </p><p> On occasion we veered a degree or two from total conformity: for example, the island shrub bed planted by an eccentric neighbor to replace the yews and junipers under the picture window was considered a blatant example of front-yard rebellion, until we decided we liked the effect and began to copy the idea. </p><p> But none of us could part with our lawns. They were as necessary to the suburban landscape as our cars. Our neighborhood, in fact, was little different from any other in North America. For nearly a century the groomed front lawn had been de rigueur on almost every street on this continent. At last count, more than 24 million acres of lawn grow in North America, and this doesn't include grasslands and areas such as highway embankments. The care and feeding of grass has become a multibillion-dollar business for lawn-care companies and for manufacturers of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, lawn mowers and all the related equipment The lawn itself is an institution, gracing more than suburban subdivisions. Highway cloverleafs have lawns, as do cemeteries, golf courses and the large corporations that take up acres of land on the outskirts of cities. </p><p> <b>Our Love of Lawns: Nature or Nurture?</b> </p><p> Where did our love of grass come from? Why are we so obsessed with lawns? One theory was put forward a few years ago by Dr. John Falk, an ecologist and former special assistant at the Smithsonian Institution, as the result of research and surveys conducted since 1978. He calls it the Savanna Syndrome. In his view; our love of grass dates back to the time when humans roamed the savannas of Africa in search of food. We preferred to forage on grassy plains dotted with copses of trees because they offered protection from predators, which we could easily spot as they crept up on us in the short grass. Over the millennia, this was encoded in our DNA. </p><p> Of course, not a word of this can be proven, although many psychologists agree that humans have an innate preference for open spaces that provide "legibility" which means an environment that's clear and easily understood. Many non-professionals among us firmly believe our love of grass -- and of gardening in general -- is an instinctive throwback to our pastoral roots or to our need to prove our superiority over nature. I confess to having expounded on these theories more than once myself. I swear my own early interest in gardening is genetic (I come from a long line of farmers), and I wasn't the only one on our street to recognize that our neighbor's obsession with his grass revealed his need for control. </p><p> But we need only look back in history to realize that cultivation of the land in general has always reflected our need to understand and control nature, if only to survive. The ancient walled gardens of Persia were physical and psychological sanctuaries from the harsh environment beyond medieval gardens, up to and including the cottage gardens of the early eighteenth century, were necessary for sustenance and survival as the source of food and herbs both culinary and medicinal. If any grass grew in those tiny closely planted cottage gardens, the goats ate it for lunch. </p><p> The North American lawn as we know it has a more recent history, as well as a more prosaic one. Our fascination with grass has its modern roots in seventeenth-century France's much-admired formal gardens of Andr� Le N�tre's Versailles, with their <i>tapis verts</i> or small green carpets of grass, built into a tight structure of beds designed to prove that man was a better landscape architect than nature. This style was copied by the English until the eighteenth century, when William Kent and Capability Brown revolutionized landscape design: in their view, nature was a power to be embraced, not controlled, and soon the manor houses of England were surrounded with great greenswards of grass that swept right up to the front doors and off to the horizon. These landscapes were considered natural, but in the end were just more cultivated lawn </p><p> <b>The Landscape Movement: Upper-Class Grass</b> </p><p> Capability Brown, in particular (his real name was Lancelot, but he was nicknamed Capability because of his constant reference to a site's "capabilities"), like the grand vision. He spared no client's expense to recontour land and uproot trees (even tearing down houses he considered unnecessary) to make smooth surfaces for carpets of grass, scythed, rolled, swept and manured into lush and perfect lawns. Sound familiar? The influence of the garden park is also evident on many of today's large suburban estates, where expanses of lawn set off with trees seem to be the only treatment the landscape architect can envision for a vast space. </p><p> This was the peak of the Landscape Movement in England, but like many other landscape styles it was accessible only to the upper classes, who had both the property and the money to care for such large areas of grass. This didn't discourage immigrants to the New World, who brought this vision of endless lawns with them. Hopeful that it would reflect the riches and class such landscapes suggested, the most affluent among the colonists borrowed the approach for their new but more modest land holdings, despite the fact that conditions here did not favor the growth of the fine lawn grasses of England. Highly placed travelers to England also admired the style and brought it back to No</p></p><h2>Ten Prayers God Always Says Yes To: Divine Answers to Life&#39;s Most Difficult Problems</h2><p><p>There have been thousands of books written about prayer and millions of sermons preached about it, yet people continue to wonder: Why doesn&#x2019;t God answer me when I cry out to him? In light of all the problems we face in life, we want to know why God is often so &#x201c;silent&#x201d; when we pray to him. Anthony DeStefano, author of the bestselling<i> A Travel Guide to Heaven,</i> knew there had to be an answer to this mystery, so he set out on a quest to find prayers that God says yes to<i> all the time</i>. The result is an extraordinary new book that has the ability to dramatically change the lives of readers of all faiths.<br>Each short, powerful prayer in <i>Ten Prayers God Always Says Yes To</i> addresses a particular problem people commonly face in life&#x2014;from accepting the existence of God to trying to make ends meet; from getting through terrible suffering to coping with everyday stress; from overcoming fear to finding your God-given destiny. Presented with a certainty and vigor that are sure to pique the interest of even those who are not spiritually inclined, these prayers will help readers find solutions to life&#x2019;s most difficult situations and provide meaningful and inspiring answers to the vexing questions we have about the purpose of our time on earth.<br>In a world awash with superficial self-help books and deceptive gimmicks, <i>Ten Prayers God Always Says Yes To</i> is the real thing. Using hundreds of scriptural references to support his claims, DeStefano writes in a simple, straightforward, and uplifting manner that makes the most profound theological matters understandable to all. In the words of the author, &#x201c;This is a spiritual treasure chest that is available to everyone....This book is about prayers that work&#x2014;really, truly work.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Anthony DeStefano is the acclaimed author of<i> A Travel Guide to Heaven</i>. He lives in New York.</p><b>1<br>I Wish I Could Believe<br><i>God, Show Me That You Exist</i><br></b><br><br>Does God exist?<br><br>Can there be a simpler yet more important question in all the universe? Can there be one that has been the source of more mental anguish and emotional confusion in the history of mankind?<br><br>It&#x2019;s ironic that a question that so many people struggle with is also one that can be answered most easily by God when we put it in the form of a prayer. For when we lift our minds and hearts in humility and say to God: &#x201c;<i>Please show me that you exist...Give me some sign that you are really up there somewhere</i>&#x201d; he is only too happy to respond&#x2014;sometimes with a speed that can astound us.<br><br>And yet people often spend decades of their life going round in circles trying to debate God&#x2019;s existence. They analyze the problem, research it, turn it over and over in their minds, go back and forth a thousand times, and at the end of the whole process, they&#x2019;re still not sure.<br><br>Why do people get caught in the &#x201c;faith maze&#x201d; so often? Probably because so many corollary questions flow from that basic question: Are we alone in the universe? Is death the end of the story? Is there a meaning to suffering? Is there a heaven or hell? Is there an ultimate plan for my life? The problem is that none of these issues can be discussed intelligently if the answer to the first question&#x2014;&#x201c;<i>Does God exist?</i>&#x201d;&#x2014;is no. If there is no God, then any talk about Providence and eternity is absurd. The funeral really is the end of the story, and life has no meaning beyond the day to day. As one of my theology professors used to say, it&#x2019;s the &#x201c;Looney Tunes&#x201d; philosophy of life, because like the old Warner Brothers cartoons, the only way to accurately describe death is with the phrase &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all, folks!&#x201d;<br><br>On the other hand, if there is a God, then a world of possibilities opens up to us. With God, not only does every human being live forever, but all the actions we take and decisions we make have a significance that extends far beyond the present moment. In fact, everything that happens to us in our life&#x2014;down to the tiniest, most insignificant detail&#x2014;is mysteriously tied to God&#x2019;s &#x201c;plan.&#x201d; (1)<br><br>There isn&#x2019;t much room for compromise here. Either we&#x2019;re alone in the world or we&#x2019;re not. Either we came about by chance or we were created for a reason. Either death is the end or it&#x2019;s the beginning. Either our situation is ultimately hopeless or it&#x2019;s ultimately blissful. There really can&#x2019;t be two more different or diametrically opposed worldviews.<br><br>So how can we come to grips with this most profound question? One way is through simple logic. In the long history of philosophy, many arguments have been put forward concerning the existence of God. Some of the greatest geniuses the world has ever known&#x2014;Aristotle, Plato, Augustine, Aquinas, Spinoza, Pascal, Descartes, and Kant, to name a few&#x2014;have made the case that there <i>is</i> a God, and that he is a real, living being.<br><br>Some of these rational &#x201c;proofs&#x201d; are very famous. There is the so&#x2013;called cosmological argument, for instance, which asks the question &#x201c;Where did everything come from?&#x201d; There is the teleological argument, which points to the order and design of the universe and asserts that there must be a &#x201c;designer.&#x201d; There is the ontological argument, which is based on the concepts of perfection and existence. There are arguments from &#x201c;efficient causality,&#x201d; from &#x201c;contingency,&#x201d; from &#x201c;desire,&#x201d; from &#x201c;degrees of perfection,&#x201d; from &#x201c;miracles,&#x201d; from &#x201c;morality and conscience,&#x201d; and from &#x201c;reliable testimonies.&#x201d; The list goes on and on.<br><br>There isn&#x2019;t time to discuss these proofs here, but all of them are based on logic, observation of the physical world and our internal consciousness, and inductive or deductive reasoning. None is based on Scripture. None attempts to prove God&#x2019;s existence by asserting that &#x201c;the Bible says this or that.&#x201d;<br><br>These logical proofs can be extremely helpful, especially to someone who tends to think that it&#x2019;s not &#x201c;intelligent&#x201d; to believe in God or that religion somehow goes against science. But the problem is that sometimes people get so wrapped up in logic that they get <i>tied up</i> in it as well. They can forget that the solution they are looking for is right in front of their eyes and doesn&#x2019;t require any arguments at all.<br><br>In the case of faith, it&#x2019;s easy to overlook the most fundamental point of all, namely, that God is <i>not</i> an argument; he is <i>not</i> a syllogism; he is <i>not</i> even a concept. God is a living being. He has the ability to know things, to desire things, to create things, and to love things. He is fully aware and involved. He is <i>alive</i>.<br><br>Why is that so important? Because living beings don&#x2019;t have to be &#x201c;proved.&#x201d; They can be <i>shown</i>. If I want to prove to everyone that my uncle Frank exists, I don&#x2019;t have to mathematically demonstrate that fact. I don&#x2019;t have to produce his birth certificate, passport, driver&#x2019;s license, or Social Security card. I can if I wish, but I don&#x2019;t have to. There&#x2019;s a much simpler solution. If I want, I can just pick up the phone, give him a call, and say, &#x201c;Hi, Uncle Frank, how are you doing today?&#x201d; And if anyone had the audacity to doubt that my uncle was really a living, breathing person, and not just some figment of my imagination, all I&#x2019;d have to do is introduce them to him.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a similar situation when we discuss God. Yes, we can come up with all kinds of fancy arguments to prove his existence, but we don&#x2019;t have to. It&#x2019;s not a strict requirement. Because God is a living being, we can simply give him a &#x201c;call.&#x201d; Since he is really, truly alive, he is going to answer us and have a conversation with us&#x2014;maybe not in the exact same way as Uncle Frank would if we called him on the phone, but close.<br><br>Does that seem too easy? I promise it&#x2019;s not. It&#x2019;s just that most people who have questions about God&#x2019;s existence have never even tried to make contact with him. They&#x2019;ve never made a sincere effort to suspend their doubts for one second and say: &#x201c;God, I don&#x2019;t know if you&#x2019;re up there. In fact, I&#x2019;m having a big problem believing in you. But if you do exist, will you please do something to show me, so that I know for sure?&#x201d;<br><br>Do you know what will happen if you say this kind of prayer? God is going to answer you. He is going to say YES. He is going to show you that he exists. Why? Because God is not some cosmic joker. He is not interested in playing hide&#x2013;and&#x2013;seek with us. His goal is not to confound and confuse us for our entire lives. Yes, he wants us to have faith in something we can&#x2019;t see or touch, but he doesn&#x2019;t expect us to do the impossible. He doesn&#x2019;t expect us to believe in something or someone we can&#x2019;t even communicate with.<br><br>You see, communication is really the key to understanding the whole mystery of faith. In fact, the history of the world is really the history of God trying to communicate with mankind. (2) By creating the universe and the planets in the first place, God was essentially &#x201c;breaking the silence.&#x201d; By creating animals and human beings, he was making conversation possible. (3) By formulating covenants with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David, he was taking the step of actually speaking to us. (4) By sending great prophets like Elijah and Isaiah to his chosen people, he was deepening his bond with us and &#x201c;revealing&#x201d; himself to us even more clearly. (5) God&#x2019;s most direct act of communication was to become a man in the person of Jesus Christ. By actually walking among us in bodily form and speaking to us plainly in our own language, God was doing everything he could to &#x201c;talk to us.&#x201d; And by sending his Holy Spirit, first to the Apostles on Pentecost Sunday and then to the rest of the world, God continues to communicate with us to this very day. (6)<br><br>The fact is that we have a God who loves to communicate. And the reason is that communication is the starting point for any relationship. Everyone has heard it said that God wants to be able to have a relationship with us. There is no truer point in all theology. Indeed, the thrust of God&#x2019;s communication with mankind over the course of history has always been <i>relational</i> and not <i>conceptual</i>. That&#x2019;s why he actually prefers it when we come to have faith in him through prayer, instead of through logical arguments alone. God doesn&#x2019;t just want to satisfy a curiosity we have, he wants to enter into a friendship with us. (7) When we take the initiative by <i>asking</i> him a question, instead of <i>treating him as a question</i>, we have actually entered into a dialogue already&#x2014;whether we know it or not. And dialogue&#x2014;back&#x2013;and&#x2013;forth conversation&#x2014;is the heart and foundation of any relationship.<br><br>Now, we couldn&#x2019;t very well have a relationship with God if the communication was all one way. We couldn&#x2019;t hope to make a bit of progress in the spiritual life if God refused to talk back to us when we ask him the simplest question: &#x201c;Are you there?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s why God is always going to answer this question when we pray to him.<br><br>How, exactly, will he do that?<br><br>Before I attempt to answer that, let me first tell you what he is <i>not</i> going to do. If you ask God to show you that he exists, he is not going to hit you over the head with a hammer. He is not going to suddenly appear before your eyes in bodily form. He&#x2019;s not going to perform some tremendous miracle for you. Of course, he can if he wants. He has that option. And he has done that at various times in history with various people, but it&#x2019;s very rare. Chances are he&#x2019;s not going to do it in your case.<br><br>And believe me, you don&#x2019;t want him to! I know that it&#x2019;s very tempting to ask God to show you he exists by performing some miracle for you. But that&#x2019;s the <i>last</i> thing you want him to do. Why? Perhaps you remember the saying &#x201c;To whom much is given, much will be expected&#x201d;? (8) That rule applies here. Let me explain.<br><br>Having to believe in a God you can&#x2019;t see is one of the &#x201c;tests&#x201d; God gives us in this life. And while it&#x2019;s not always the easiest test in the world, it is certainly a test we can all pass. I remember playing a game with my friends when I was a boy in which we had to close our eyes and fall backward into the hands of another boy standing behind us. It was basically a game of trust. You had to believe that your friend was going to catch you. If he didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;if he wanted to play a nasty, cruel joke on you&#x2014;he could actually let you fall and hit the ground. The idea, of course, was that your friend would never do something like that to you. But you still had to trust him, because he could let you fall if he wanted. You were putting yourself in his hands. It wasn&#x2019;t a big risk you were taking, but it was still a scary feeling to be falling backward with your eyes closed and your arms folded in front of you.<br><br>This is similar to the kind of faith test God gives us in life. By being invisible, he is essentially asking us to close our eyes as we fall back. He is asking us to <i>trust</i> him. Now, we can pass the test by believing in him; we can fail it by becoming hardened atheists; or, in rare circumstances, we can have the test taken away from us completely. How so?<br><br>If God wishes to, he can always perform a great miracle for us or show us some kind of vision. If he were to do that, we would no longer need to believe in something we couldn&#x2019;t see. We&#x2019;d have demonstrative, &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; evidence instead. And that&#x2019;s exactly what some people ask God to do. They want a miracle. They want to hear the voice of God announcing his presence in a silent room. They want to see an angel appear before their eyes. They want a chair or a desk to move by itself across the floor. They don't want to close their eyes as they fall back into God's hands. They don&#x2019;t want to trust God.<br><br>But this is where we really have to be careful. Because if God takes away the test of faith from you, he's going to put another test in its place. And you can be sure that this other test won&#x2019;t be easy.<br><br>You see, the overwhelming majority of mankind has to go through life having faith in an invisible God. (9) If you, by some incredible act of God&#x2019;s mercy, are excused from that obligation, you can be certain that you will be expected to perform some pretty incredible feat later on, including even the possibility of giving your life.<br><br>Remember what happened to Moses? He was given the privilege of seeing the finger of God write the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai. But then he had to lead a life of hardship and sacrifice in the desert for fifty years and was denied access to the Promised Land. Similarly, Jesus&#x2019; apostles were given the honor of seeing the Lord perform many wondrous miracles before and after his Resurrection&#x2014;but all of them had to die horrible martyrs&#x2019; deaths at the hands of the Romans. (All except John, who was not killed but instead tortured by being dipped into a vat of boiling oil.) Saint Paul was struck blind on the road to Damascus and actually heard God&#x2019;s voice speak to him&#x2014;but after that he had to suffer greatly, was scourged countless times, shipwrecked twice, and finally beheaded in Rome. (10)<br><br>The pages of the Bible and the history of God&#x2019;s church on earth are filled with examples just like these. Like it or not, these are the kinds of tests God offers as <i>substitutions</i> for the faith test. Is that something you really want to chance?<br><br>I&#x2019;m not implying that miracles are &#x201c;bad&#x201d; or that asking God to perform a miracle for you is wrong. Miracles happen every day. When you are confronted with a problem you can&#x2019;t solve, it&#x2019;s only natural to ask God to intervene on your behalf in a supernatural manner. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with that. What I&#x2019;m talking about here are those miracles that are so clear, powerful, and indisputable that they essentially render &#x201c;faith&#x201d; in God unnecessary and superfluous. If you ask for that kind of miracle and actually receive one, watch out!<br><br>On the other hand, if you simply ask God to show you that he exists, without all the lightning and thunder, you can expect to be answered just as clearly but without the requisite heroic sacrifice. How so?<br><br>Very simply, God will give you a <i>sign</i> of his presence&#x2014;a real, genuine, bona fide sign. The exact nature of this sign will be up to him, of course. We always have to remember that God is sovereign and can do anything he likes. But you can be sure it will be something out of the ordinary. Something that&#x2014;to you, at least&#x2014;will border on the supernatural. It might be something &#x201c;big&#x201d; or something small; dramatic or quiet; profound or simple. It might come to you through the conversation of a friend or while you are at a church service. It might even come to you while you&#x2019;re at a baseball game! God speaks to different people in different ways and at different times.</p><h2>A Liaden Universe Constellation, Vol. 2</h2><p>BOOK 2&nbsp;in The First Liaden Universe � Collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen short tales of the Liaden Universe� brought together for the first time.

He is a Fellow of the British Academy, a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, and professor emeritus at London University.NO SIMPLE VICTORY is no simple book. Rather than chronicle WWII from beginning to end, the author explores hundreds of its skirmishes and principal characters in no seeming order. He throws out the names of battles, generals, and politicians without assignation, as though we know them all from a previous life. With an aristocratic British accent, Simon Vance does his best to turn a dry and confusing narrative into a pleasant experience. He performs well with French and Russian names but occasionally loses the last word of a sentence. After hearing Vance adopt the authors attitude and read his flight of opinions, the listener might mistake the narrator for Davies himself.

Looking for the killer, he discovers a city of faded loneliness, unexpected danger, and bewildering contradictions. His investigation introduces him to a beautiful Cuban policewoman; to the rituals of Santeria; to an American fugitive and a group of ruthless mercenaries. In this place where all things Russian are despised, where Hemingway fished and the KGB flourished, where the hint of music is always in the air, Arkady finds a trail of deceit that reaches halfway around the world&#x2013;and a reason to relish his own life again.</p><p>In this fourth book in Martin Cruz Smith's splendid series, an amiable Irish American gangster explains to Arkady Renko what he and the other 84 wanted Americans hiding out in Cuba do with themselves. "We try to stay alive. Useful. Tell me, Arkady, what are <i>you</i> doing here?" "The same," says Renko--and it's true. His life as a Russian cop has become so bleak and lonely that he takes any opportunity to shake things up, even spending his own savings to fly to Havana when an old colleague is found dead--floating inside an inner tube after night-fishing in Havana Bay. Renko sets out to make himself useful in this shabby, fascinating, haunted country whose inhabitants look on Russians with the cold disdain of survivors of a nasty divorce.<p> As he did so well in <i>Gorky Park</i>, Smith again makes Renko very much a classic Russian hero in temperament and tradition, but also the eternal outsider. He is at times close to the edge of despair--but his trip to Havana restores his natural curiosity and life force.</p><p> In this hot Havana, ripe with the fruity smell of sex, Renko keeps his Moscow overcoat on--until an equally idealistic and out-of-place young female cop gets him to loosen up. There's an unusually complex plot, even for the sly strand-spinner Smith. He raises baffling questions: Why would a group of military plotters order illegal lobsters in a fancy restaurant and then not eat them? And his descriptions of Cuban life are dead-on, reminding us on every page what a superb stylist he is. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>10 cds</p><h2>Continental Infantryman of the American Revolution (Warrior)</h2><p>America raised three distinct forces to win its revolution: untrained, short-service militiamen; state troops; and the regular Continentals.

The bond between the hunter and his hounds was one of deep trust and reliance, in a time when the changing landscape threatened to take it all. Trained by a Hound Dog recounts the legends of the hunt, in the authentic voice of the man who was there, told as if the reader were sitting with him around a campfire. The true stories he tells of his hounds and the lions and bears they caught in some of the country's toughest terrain and conditions are a glimpse into an era of Western History that has faded from view. "The old time way of hunting and peoples' views of country living was changing. Like it or not, it was coming. The old lion hunters that once roamed these hills, hunters like Jay Bruce, Charlie Leadshaw, or Howard Bilton, and others are now gone. All that's left of this, is knowing there was a time when they were here, and at that time there was only one way to get it done, and that was the hard way. Today they are only a part of history, a history that unfortunately cannot be duplicated."

McKillip </b>is a winner of the World Fantasy Award, and the author of numerous novels.Once the city of Berylon was benevolently ruled by Raven Tormalyne, until his rival, the ambitious Arioso Pellior, the Basilisk, burned Tormalyne Palace. Of all the family, only young Rook, cowering under the ashes in the fireplace, survived. Rook was sent to the remote island Luly, where he became a bard (poet/musician) and produced a son, Hollis, but could never bring himself to remember his heritage. Nearly 40 years later, young Griffin Tormalyne, a distant relative, arrives at Luly, forcing Rook to confront his past. So he travels into the magical hinterlands, where, after various adventures, he recovers his memory and some of his inherited magic powers. But when he returns to Luly, Griffin is dead and the school burned. The Basilisk, meantime, a master of subtle magics, trains his dragon-eyed daughter Luna to succeed him. Rook, arriving in Berylon, takes a job cataloguing old music manuscripts that the Basilisk recovered from ruined Tormalyne Palace, and acquires a magical pipe to use against the Basilisk. But there are further complications: relatives of Griffin are smuggling in weapons and plotting against the Basilisk; the Basilisk's plain, empty-headed daughter Damiet falls in love with Rook; Hollis shows up; and Rook finds himself strongly attracted to Luna, a magician more powerful than her father. Previous McKillip offerings (Winter Rose, 1996, etc.) have been charming, elegant wisps; this one, after a rather laborious start, presses forward with altogether more determination and substance: a significant improvement overall. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Born in Canada, she moved to Boston as a child, and lived in New England most of her life. After graduating from college, she made a career in advertising, writing copy for the Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Company before moving on to Boston firm N. H. Miller &amp; Co., where she rose to the rank of vice president. In her spare time, MacLeod wrote short stories, and in 1964 published her first novel, a children's book called Mystery of the White Knight.&nbsp;</p> <p></p>Another appearance by Sarah Kelling Bittersohn and her husband Max will please their many fans. This time they are out to find a missing 1927 New Phantom Rolls Royce, part of Nehemiah (Bill) Billingsgate's collection of antique cars housed on his baroque estate on the Massachusetts shore. The investigation begins at the Billingsgates's annual Renaissance Revel, featuring costumed revellers and appropriate food (frumenty and mock peacock), drink (mead) and entertainment (Morris dancers). Then old family retainer Rufus, set to the task of guarding the collection, is found hanged, and another Rolls, a Silver Ghost, is missing. While trying to patronize Max, the local police chief makes a hash of the investigation, but Sarah and Max forge ahead. Then a second body is found, that of Vercingetorix Ufford, a medieval and renaissance specialist who also serves as a consultant to Billinsgate's chain of radio stations. It appears that he's been soaked in honey and stung to death by the Billingsgates's bees (they make and sell mead as a hobby). A roster of prime suspects must be pursued and a good many complications unraveled before the villain is found. As usual, MacLeod (The Recycled Citizen) can be counted on for a witty, literate and charming mystery. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Eggnog Murder</h2><p><i>With the fireplace crackling, the tree twinkling, and the carols humming, few things in life are as picture perfect as Christmas in Maine&#x2014;until murder dampens the holiday spirit.

Galgut lives in Cape Town, South Africa.<b>ONE<br>THE FOLLOWER</b><br>It happens like this. He sets out in the afternoon on the track that has been shown to him and soon he leaves the little town behind. In an hour or so he is among low hills covered by olive trees and grey stones, from which there is a view out over a plain that gradually descends to the sea. He is intensely happy, which is possible for him when he is walking and alone.<br>&nbsp;<br>As the road rises and falls there are moments when he can see far ahead and other moments when he can see nothing at all. He keeps looking out for other people, but the huge landscape seems to be completely deserted. The only sign of human beings is the occasional house, tiny and distant, and the fact of the road itself.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then at some point, as he comes to the crest of a hill, he becomes aware of another figure far away. It could be male or female, it could be any age, it could be travelling in either direction, towards him or away. He watches until the road dips out of sight, and when he comes to the top of the next rise the figure is clearer, coming towards him. Now they are watching each other, while pretending they are not.<br>&nbsp;<br>When they draw even they stop. The figure is a man about his own age, dressed entirely in black. Black pants and shirt, black boots. Even his rucksack is black. What the first man is wearing I don&#x2019;t know, I forget.<br>&nbsp;<br>They nod hello, they smile.<br>&nbsp;<br>Where have you come from.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mycenae. He points back over his shoulder. And you.<br>&nbsp;<br>The man in black also points, vaguely, into the distance behind him. And where are you going to. He has an accent the first man cannot place, Scandinavian maybe, or German.<br>&nbsp;<br>To the ruins.<br>&nbsp;<br>I thought the ruins were that way.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yes. Not those ruins, I&#x2019;ve seen them.<br>&nbsp;<br>There are other ruins.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>How far.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think ten kilometres. That&#x2019;s what I was told.<br>&nbsp;<br>He nods. He has a sullen sort of beauty, with long silky hair that falls around his shoulders. He is smiling, though there is nothing to smile at. And where do you come from.<br>&nbsp;<br>South Africa. And you.<br>&nbsp;<br>I am from Germany. Where are you staying in Mycenae.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the youth hostel.<br>&nbsp;<br>There are a lot of people.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m the only one there. Are you staying.<br>&nbsp;<br>He shakes his head, the long tresses lift and float. I am taking the train tonight. To Athens.<br>&nbsp;<br>They have conducted this conversation with a curious formality, the width of the road between them, and yet there is something in the way they relate that is not quite intimate, but familiar. As if they have met somewhere before, long ago. But they have not.<br>&nbsp;<br>Enjoy the ruins, the German man smiles. The South African says that he will. Then they part again with a nod and draw slowly away from each other on the narrow white road, looking back now and then, until they are two tiny and separate points again, rising and falling with the undulations of the land.<br>&nbsp;<br>He gets to the ruins in the middle of the afternoon. I can&#x2019;t even remember now what they are, the remains of some big but obscure building, there was a fence that had to be climbed, there was a fear of dogs but no dogs appeared, he stumbles around among rocks and pillars and ledges, he tries to imagine how it was but history resists imagining. He sits on the edge of a raised stone floor and stares out unseeingly into the hills around him and now he is thinking of things that happened in the past. Looking back at him through time, I remember him remembering, and I am more present in the scene than he was. But memory has its own distances, in part he is me entirely, in part he is a stranger I am watching.<br>&nbsp;<br>By the time he comes to himself again, the sun is already low in the sky, the shadows of the mountains are stretched out across the plain. He walks back slowly in the blue coolness. The stars are seeding themselves in bright beds overhead, the earth is huge and old and black. It&#x2019;s long past suppertime when he arrives at the edge of the little village and goes up the deserted main street, the shops and restaurants shuttered and barred, all the windows unlit, through the open front door of the hostel, up the stairs, through passages, past rooms filled with row after row of unoccupied bunk beds, all dark and cold, nobody visiting at this time of year, to the last and highest room, in the middle of the roof, a white cube fixed to a plane. He is very tired now, and hungry, and wants to sleep.<br>&nbsp;<br>But inside the room the German is waiting. He is sitting on one of the beds, his hands between his knees, smiling.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hello.<br>&nbsp;<br>He goes in and closes the door behind him. What are you doing here.<br>&nbsp;<br>I missed the train tonight. There is another one in the morning. I decided to wait until then. I asked him to put me in your room.<br>&nbsp;<br>I see that.<br>&nbsp;<br>You don&#x2019;t mind.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m just surprised, I wasn&#x2019;t expecting, no, I don&#x2019;t mind.<br>&nbsp;<br>He doesn&#x2019;t mind, but he is also uneasy. He knows that the other man has delayed his journey not because of the train but because of him, because of the conversation they had in the road.<br>&nbsp;<br>He sits down on his own bed. They smile at each other again.<br>&nbsp;<br>How long are you here for.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m also going in the morning.<br>&nbsp;<br>Are you going to Athens.<br>&nbsp;<br>No. The other way. To Sparta.<br>&nbsp;<br>So you&#x2019;ve seen Mycenae already.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;ve been here two days.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ah.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is a silence now in which neither of them moves.<br>&nbsp;<br>I might stay another day. I&#x2019;m not in a rush. I like this place.<br>&nbsp;<br>The German considers. I thought I might also. I haven&#x2019;t seen Mycenae.<br>&nbsp;<br>You should see it.<br>&nbsp;<br>So you are staying.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yes. Then I am staying also. For a day.<br>&nbsp;<br>It feels as if they&#x2019;ve agreed to something more than this practical arrangement, but what exactly isn&#x2019;t clear. It is late and cold and the little room is raw and ugly in the fluorescent light. In a short while the South African gets into his sleeping bag. He is shy and though he would normally undress he doesn&#x2019;t do so tonight. He takes off his shoes and his watch and his two copper bracelets and gets in and lies on his back. He can see the metal slats of the bunk above him and disconnected images from the day come back to him, the ruins, the road, the gnarled shapes of the olive trees.<br>&nbsp;<br>The German also readies himself for bed. He lays out his sleeping bag on the bunk he&#x2019;s sitting on. Of course his sleeping bag is black.<br>&nbsp;<br>He unlaces his boots and takes them off, setting them side by side on the floor. Perhaps he too would normally undress but he doesn&#x2019;t tonight, there is no way to know what he would normally do. He doesn&#x2019;t wear a watch. In his black socks he goes to the door to switch off the light, then goes softly back to his bed and climbs in. He takes a few moments to settle.<br>&nbsp;<br>The South African says something.<br>&nbsp;<br>I can&#x2019;t hear you.<br>&nbsp;<br>What is your name.<br>&nbsp;<br>Reiner. And you.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m Damon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Damon. Good night.<br>&nbsp;<br>Good night, Reiner.<br>&nbsp;<br>Good night.</p><h2>Bible According To Spike Milligan</h2><p>The Bible According to Spike Milligan is an irreverent but very funny spoof of The Old Testament in which, in his own inimitable fashion, Spike Milligan gives his version of the best known biblical stories.

Will she ever lose her sense of humor about the goofy vicissitudes of the lesbian community? If this seventh book of her serial cartoon collection about Mo, the feminist bookseller everywoman and her cohorts, is any indication, I&#39;d have to say no. Bechdel here sets her wry and wonderful sights on the explosion of lesbian erotica.Bechdel's comic strip <i>Dykes to Watch Out For</i> resembles Armistead Maupin's prose-only serial <i>Tales of the City</i>, but Bechdel's all-lesbian main cast affords gays an in-group pleasure that Maupin's all-preferences cast doesn't, and her mock-soap-operatics are funnier and smarter than Maupin's. In the seventh <i>Dykes</i> collection, lesbian mom Toni and her lover Clarice move Clarice's suit to become legal coparent forward; a young lesbian-deconstructionist professor comes to town and antagonizes-attracts gay-left purist Mo; African American Ph.D. candidate Ginger finally writes that dissertation; and the strip's principal setting, Madwimmin Books, weathers financial crisis and an erotica-oriented fund-raiser that mortifies owner Jezanna no end ("`I'll open a bookstore' I thought. `The life of the mind,' I thought").

Rex.</i>&nbsp;He is also co-author of the&nbsp;picture book&nbsp;<i>Santa Knows.</i>&nbsp;Visit Greg at www.gregleitichsmith.com.Wrenching in its detail, this account of the author's final two years with his companion and "beloved friend" Roger Horwitz, who died of AIDS in 1986, personalizes the epidemic's appalling statistics with heartbreaking clarity. Poet and novelist Monette (Love Alone: 18 Elegies for Rog) applies admirable candor and control to the task of chronicling the suffering endured in the months between the diagnosis and death of the man with whom he had spent over 10 years. Monette brings to the narrative a poet's eye for the telling image or metaphor, and makes this far more than a simple compendium of medical disasters: the memoir transcends the particulars of the AIDS epidemic to stand as an eloquent testimonial to the power of love and the devastation of loss, the courage of the ill and the anger, fear and dedication of their loved ones. Despite its universal resonances, the book is perhaps most valuable as a vital addition to the literature of the AIDS epidemic. Affluent and exceptionally well connected in the L.A. gay elite, Horwitz was no typical AIDS patient: Monette maneuvered him into various experimental programs (he was the first AIDS patient west of the Mississippi to have access to AZT), and the firsthand glimpse of the "netherworld of the sick," negotiating the byzantine route to the next "magic bullet" offers vivid confirmation of the human cost of the government's initial policy of informed neglect. "A gay man seeks his history in mythic fragments, random as blocks of stone in the ruins covered in Greek characters, gradually being erased in the summer rain," the author writes of a trip to Greece he and Horwitz took shortly before the diagnosis. Monette's moving history is just such a fragment for future generations, a touchstone reference to a tragic time that we cannot allow to be erased. <br> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> )<br><br>"Why don't you write about this? Nobody else does." These words, from one of the doctors treating Monette's lover Roger Horwitz during his well-fought but losing battle with AIDS, prompted this book. Purged of the tendency toward jeremiad he displayed in Love Alone ( LJ 4/1/88), poems written during the last months of Rog's life, Monette has fused "unresolved rage" with eloquence to produce a gripping, accessible, and essential book. Monette captures the everyday minutiae and roller coaster emotions of living with AIDS, taking us from his first personal exposure to the epidemic via an old friend, through the 19 months between Rog's diagnosis and death. Monette's solipsistic dedication to a community of prosperous, white gay men can be annoying, but the book's strength is that it is always annoyingly, believably real.

Now he is moving them west again to Oregon: "I hear tell land out there is the finest a man could want." Although Rebecca longs to stay put, Mama explains that this is "Papa's dream." They set out in spring, and during the six-month journey, Papa nearly dies while crossing a river, little brother Harrison falls out of the wagon three times, and Rebecca makes friends with fellow travelers. She also starts to collect scraps of cloth for her quilt bag&#x2014;from Papa's torn shirt, Mama's apron, her old travel dress. When they finally arrive at their destination, she sews a quilt, and she and her siblings sleep under the snuggly blanket in their Oregon cabin. An author's note explains that the pattern of Rebecca's quilt was a popular mid-19th-century design called "Wandering Foot" in celebration of the pioneer spirit, but that quilters eventually changed the name to "Turkey Tracks." Bond's excellent illustrations, done in acrylics on watercolor paper, provide an ideal dreamy background for the story. The smooth first-person narrative, appealing dialogue, and sunny artwork vividly capture a child's experience in the early days of the United States.&#x2014;<i>Lee Bock, Glenbrook Elementary School, Pulaski, WI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In these pages Professor Coe distills a lifetime's scholarship for the general reader and student. Since the publication of the sixth edition of <em>The Maya</em>, new sites have been uncovered and further excavations in old sites have proceeded at an unprecedented pace. Among the many new discoveries is the chance find of extraordinary murals dating to ca. AD 100 at San Bartolo in the Peten. New epigraphic, archaeological, and osteological research has thrown light on the identity of the "founding fathers" of such great sites as Tikal and Copan, and their close affiliation with Teotihuacan in central Mexico. The previously little known center of Ek' Balam in northeastern Yucatan has turned out to be a regional kingdom of major importance, with extraordinary stucco reliefs and a plethora of painted inscriptions. It has now become apparent that the birth of Maya civilization lies not in the Classic but during the Preclassic period, above all in the Mirador Basin of northern Guatemala, where the builders of gigantic ancient cities (interconnected by causeways) erected the world's largest pyramid as early as 200 BC. All of these finds suggest that we must rethink what we mean by "Classic." The seventh edition also presents new evidence for the use of wetlands by the Classic Maya, and fresh perspectives on the catastrophic demise of Classic civilization by the close of the ninth century. 175 illustrations, 17 in color</p><p>Michael D. Coe is Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University. His books include The Maya, Mexico, Breaking the Maya Code, Angkor and the Khmer Civilization, and&nbsp;Reading the Maya Glyphs. He lives in New Haven, Connecticut.Because of the wealth of new archaeological data and breakthroughs in the translation of hieroglyphs, Coe's updating of his classic synthesis of Maya civilization provides a valuable service to both informed lay readers and specialists wishing to apprise themselves of the current state of understanding of this most intellectually sophisticated and aesthetically refined pre-Columbian culture. Although the vast majority of the text may be found in the prior edition, the work is transformed by significant interpolations and deletions and is augmented by a new section of color plates, a useful guide for travelers, and a listing of Maya rulers. As it now stands, this refreshed and renewed little masterpiece merits a place in collections serving students of ancient Mesoamerica. Continuing a tradition of massive exhibitions and concomitant exhibition catalogs, the Palazzo Grassi, Venice, has at last discovered the New World. This initial incursion wisely focuses on the most accessible of the great pre-Hispanic cultures, the Maya. In this daunting but unfocused potpourri, some 29 essayists broach nearly the full range of Maya historical, societal, intellectual, political, and artistic traditions with varying degrees of competence. As is common with collective efforts of this sort, one finds both a certain redundancy of elementary facts and a not infrequent inconsistency about the facts themselves. Crammed into the last hundred pages of the volume is the catalog of more than 500 well-illustrated but only perfunctorily documented and analyzed objects. Aside from its value as a remarkable gathering of some 1400 excellent color reproductions, this ill-balanced and ultimately superficial tome has little to recommend it.ARobert Cahn, Fashion Inst. of Technology, New York<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Oxford Book of Flowerless Plants: Ferns, Fungi Mosses and Liverworts, Lichens and Seaweeds</h2><p>Sm Quarto, 1966, PP.208, Companion To The Oxford Book Of Wild Flowers On Ferns, Fungi, Mosses And Liverworts, Lichens, And Seaweeds</p><p></p><h2>Sexy Cheeks</h2><p>Text in English, French &amp; German.

She and her husband, Bill, coauthor a series of Victorian-Edwardian mysteries under the name Robin Paige, which includes such titles as <i>Death at Glamis Castle </i>and <i>Death at Whitechapel</i>.In Albert's formulaic if still enjoyable 19th China Bayles mystery (after 2010's Holly Blues), the Pecan Springs, Tex., herbalist discovers a trailer on fire on a country road, but she's unable to rescue the unknown woman trapped inside before it explodes. Jessica Nelson, an ambitious intern at the local newspaper, the Pecan Springs Enterprise, has both professional and personal reasons for aggressively chasing an obvious arson homicide story. When Jessica disappears, a puzzled China retraces Jessica's steps, but is wise enough to keep police chief Sheila Dawson and Sheriff Blackie Blackwell in the loop. China's 11-year-old niece, Caitlin, and flamboyant friend Ruby Wilcox lend a hand. A serviceable plot keeps readers guessing about both victim and killer, while Albert provides a strong helping of botanical lore&#x2014;this time on psychoactive plants and their use&#x2014;and a handful of intriguing recipes.

The brilliant, breathtaking conclusion to J.K. Rowling's spellbinding series is not for the faint of heart--such revelations, battles, and betrayals await in <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> that no fan will make it to the end unscathed. Luckily, Rowling has prepped loyal readers for the end of her series by doling out increasingly dark and dangerous tales of magic and mystery, shot through with lessons about honor and contempt, love and loss, and right and wrong. Fear not, you will find no spoilers in our review--to tell the plot would ruin the journey, and <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> is an odyssey the likes of which Rowling's fans have not yet seen, and are not likely to forget. But we would be remiss if we did not offer one small suggestion before you embark on your final adventure with Harry--bring plenty of tissues. <p> The heart of Book 7 is a hero's mission--not just in Harry's quest for the Horcruxes, but in his journey from boy to man--and Harry faces more danger than that found in all six books combined, from the direct threat of the Death Eaters and you-know-who, to the subtle perils of losing faith in himself. Attentive readers would do well to remember Dumbledore's warning about making the choice between "what is right and what is easy," and know that Rowling applies the same difficult principle to the conclusion of her series. While fans will find the answers to hotly speculated questions about Dumbledore, Snape, and you-know-who, it is a testament to Rowling's skill as a storyteller that even the most astute and careful reader will be taken by surprise. </p><p> A spectacular finish to a phenomenal series, <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> is a bittersweet read for fans. The journey is hard, filled with events both tragic and triumphant, the battlefield littered with the bodies of the dearest and despised, but the final chapter is as brilliant and blinding as a phoenix's flame, and fans and skeptics alike will emerge from the confines of the story with full but heavy hearts, giddy and grateful for the experience. <i>--Daphne Durham</i> </p><p> <strong>Deluxe Edition Details</strong> <br>The Deluxe Edition includes an exclusive insert featuring near-scale reproductions of Mary GrandPr�'s interior art, as well as never-before-seen full-color frontispiece art on special paper.

Our list features favorite moments, characters, and artifacts from the first five books. Keep in mind that this list is by no means exhaustive (what we love about Harry could fill ten books!) and does not include any of the spectacular revelatory moments that would spoil the books for those (few) who have not read them. Enjoy. <p><strong><i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i></strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Harry's first trip to the zoo with the Dursleys, when a boa constrictor winks at him. <br>* When the Dursleys' house is suddenly besieged by letters for Harry from Hogwarts. Readers learn how much the Dursleys have been keeping from Harry. Rowling does a wonderful job in displaying the lengths to which Uncle Vernon will go to deny that magic exists. <br>* Harry's first visit to Diagon Alley with Hagrid. Full of curiosities and rich with magic and marvel, Harry's first trip includes a trip to Gringotts and Ollivanders, where Harry gets his wand (holly and phoenix feather) and discovers yet another connection to He-Who-Must-No-Be-Named. This moment is the reader's first full introduction to Rowling's world of witchcraft and wizards.<br>* Harry's experience with the Sorting Hat. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i></strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* The de-gnoming of the Weasleys' garden. Harry discovers that even wizards have chores--gnomes must be grabbed (ignoring angry protests "Gerroff me! Gerroff me!"), swung about (to make them too dizzy to come back), and tossed out of the garden--this delightful scene highlights Rowling's clever and witty genius. <br>* Harry's first experience with a Howler, sent to Ron by his mother. <br>* The Dueling Club battle between Harry and Malfoy. Gilderoy Lockhart starts the Dueling Club to help students practice spells on each other, but he is not prepared for the intensity of the animosity between Harry and Draco. Since they are still young, their minibattle is innocent enough, including tickling and dancing charms. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i></strong><br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Ron's attempt to use a telephone to call Harry at the Dursleys'. <br>* Harry's first encounter with a Dementor on the train (and just about any other encounter with Dementors). Harry's brush with the Dementors is terrifying and prepares Potter fans for a darker, scarier book. <br>* Harry, Ron, and Hermione's behavior in Professor Trelawney's Divination class. Some of the best moments in Rowling's books occur when she reminds us that the wizards-in-training at Hogwarts are, after all, just children. Clearly, even at a school of witchcraft and wizardry, classes can be boring and seem pointless to children. <br>* The Boggart lesson in Professor Lupin's classroom. <br>* Harry, Ron, and Hermione's knock-down confrontation with Snape. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i></strong><br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Hermione's disgust at the reception for the veela (Bulgarian National Team Mascots) at the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling's fourth book addresses issues about growing up--the dynamic between the boys and girls at Hogwarts starts to change. Nowhere is this more plain than the hilarious scene in which magical cheerleaders nearly convince Harry and Ron to jump from the stands to impress them. <br>* Viktor Krum's crush on Hermione--and Ron's objection to it. <br>* Malfoy's "Potter Stinks" badge. <br>* Hermione's creation of S.P.E.W., the intolerant bigotry of the Death Eaters, and the danger of the Triwizard Tournament. Add in the changing dynamics between girls and boys at Hogwarts, and suddenly Rowling's fourth book has a weight and seriousness not as present in early books in the series. Candy and tickle spells are left behind as the students tackle darker, more serious issues and take on larger responsibilities, including the knowledge of illegal curses.</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i></strong><br> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr><td> </td> <td>* Harry's outburst to his friends at No. 12 Grimmauld Place. A combination of frustration over being kept in the dark and fear that he will be expelled fuels much of Harry's anger, and it all comes out at once, directly aimed at Ron and Hermione. Rowling perfectly portrays Harry's frustration at being too old to shirk responsibility, but too young to be accepted as part of the fight that he knows is coming. <br>* Harry's detention with Professor Umbridge. Rowling shows her darker side, leading readers to believe that Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven for young wizards. Dolores represents a bureaucratic tyrant capable of real evil, and Harry is forced to endure their private battle of wills alone. <br>* Harry and Cho's painfully awkward interactions. Rowling clearly remembers what it was like to be a teenager. <br>* Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape. <br>* Dumbledore's confession to Harry.</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i></strong><br> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr><td> </td> <td>* The introduction of the Horcrux. <br>* Molly Weasley asking Arthur Weasley about his "dearest ambition." Rowling has always been great at revealing little intriguing bits about her characters at a time, and Arthur&#x2019;s answer "to find out how airplanes stay up" reminds us about his obsession with Muggles.<br>* Harry's private lessons with Dumbledore, and more time spent with the fascinating and dangerous pensieve, arguably one of Rowling&#x2019;s most ingenious inventions.<br>* Fred and George Weasley&#x2019;s Joke Shop, and the slogan: "Why Are You Worrying About You-Know-Who? You Should Be Worrying About U-NO-POO--the Constipation Sensation That's Gripping the Nation!"<br>* Luna's Quidditch commentary.

Is the feeling all in our head? And what about related phenomena, such as telepathy and premonitions? Are they merely subjective beliefs? In <b>The Sense of Being Stared At</b>, renowned biologist Rupert Sheldrake explores the intricacies of the mind and discovers that our perceptive abilities are stronger than many of us could have imagined.<br><br>Despite a traditional academic background, Sheldrake has devoted his notable career as a scientist and writer to challenging the boundaries of &#x201c;acceptable&#x201d; science. A firm believer in the power of an experiment to yield answers about nature, he has dedicated years of intense research to investigating our common beliefs about what he calls our &#x201c;seventh sense.&#x201d; After compiling a database of 4,000 case histories, 2,000 questionnaires, 1,500 telephone interviews, and the results of a decade of scientifically controlled experiments, Sheldrake argues persuasively in this compelling, innovative book that such phenomena are real. In fact, he rejects the label of &#x201c;paranormal&#x201d; and shows how these psychic occurrences are a normal part of human nature. <br><br>As an explanation for this more intimate connection with the external world, Sheldrake suggests that our minds are not limited to our brains, but rather stretch outward to touch the beings and objects that we perceive. Once this extended influence of the mind is taken into consideration, many puzzling phenomena begin to make sense, including telepathy and phantom limbs. <br><br>Sheldrake shows that telepathy depends on social bonds. He traces its evolution from the connections between members of animal groups such as flocks, schools, and packs. In the modern world, telepathy occurs most commonly just before telephone calls. <br><br>Sheldrake summarizes startling new experimental evidence for the reality of telephone telepathy, and shows how readers can do tests for themselves. Combining the tradition of pragmatic experimentation with a refusal to allow science to fall into dogmatism, Sheldrake pioneers an intriguing new inquiry into the mysteries of our deepest nature. Rigorously researched, yet completely accessible, this groundbreaking book provides a refreshing new way of thinking about ourselves and our relationships with other people, with animals, and with the world around us.</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Rupert Sheldrake continues to charter a new course in our understanding of the non-local mind that connects all of us. His scientific explorations and his elegant theories are bringing us to a closer and more experiential knowledge of the luminous mystery in which we are all bathed. The application of this understanding has the potential to heal our world.&#x201d; &#x2014;Deepak Chopra, M.D., author of <b>How to Know God</b> and <b>The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success<br></b>Dr Rupert Sheldrake is a biologist and author of more than sixty technical papers and nine books, including Dogs That Know When Their Owners are Coming Home.

In Shanower's latest installment of his monumental, Eisner award&#x2013;winning retelling of the Trojan War, the Achaean fleet finally arrives at the shore of Troy. Before the war can begin, the story's many vivid characters get another chance to display their natures, including Achilles impulsively pursuing glory, young Troilus yearning over Cressida, Hektor preaching reasonable compromise in an impossible situation, slippery Odysseus orating, and Helen and Paris so besotted with each other and themselves that they'll let kingdoms drift into ruin. Shanower's people are well drawn in more ways than one, so readers can enjoy picking out the postures and expressions of individuals in a crowd scene. Impressive as the black and white art is, some of the panels are crammed with details, just as the pages are filled with text as the characters have their say. Then, readers notice how cleverly Troilus's lovesick funk is treated in repetitious, mostly silent panels&#x2014;or how subtly the climactic appearance of an Achaean embassy to Trojan King Priam, the last chance to prevent the impending war, is managed with a mixture of closeups and long shots, open line work and encroaching shadows. On all levels, this is a brilliant work. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Grade 10 Up&#x2013;The many highlights of this book could read like movie credits: original camera placement and lighting; brisk direction and pacing. There is never a dull drawing, and each one carries the excitement and story forward. Shanower captures Helen's beauty in black-and-white images that are rich in design and fine in line. Helen's character, however, is not so lovingly drawn. Her vanity is matched only by the self-absorption of her second husband, Paris, son of Priam and architect of Troy's downfall. Shanower has a talent for drawing facial expressions, and the smug look on Paris's face has readers rooting for Troy's enemies as expressed by Odysseus's spit-spewing venom. The author skillfully weaves together many characters and story lines. Troilus and Cressida make an appearance in the midst of the oncoming war and are featured in an erotic dream tryst with naked breasts (male and female) and bottoms (male). <i>Betrayal</i> also offers a respectable balance of men loving men to go with the more traditional plotlines of men loving women and men killing men. Given the multitude of plots and characters, it is recommended to have the whole series, which is ongoing, available.<i>&#x2013;Will Marston, Berkeley Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Julian, with seasoned experience as a leadership management consultant for companies such as 3M, Honeywell, AT&amp;T and General Mills, provides solid answers for this troubling dilemma. He discusses 10 key principles that he deems essential for transforming workplace problems into both spiritual and bottom-line success stories. Each chapter poses an issue (such as developing patience, cultivating leadership by example, yielding control, making tough decisions and maintaining right priorities) followed by a solution. In a chapter on "integration," for example, Julian poses the bottom-line question: "How do I balance employee needs with profit obligations?" To explain his approach (to "integrate people and profits into win-win solutions"), Julian details the experiences of two business executives who have creatively solved this problem, and shares the underlying principles they implemented. Indeed, the personal stories of business leaders form the core of the book, tied together by Julian's practical steps and discussion questions at the close of each chapter. Readers will be especially intrigued by the trials and triumphs of such well-regarded business executives as S. Truett Cathy (Chick-Fil-A), Bob O. Naegele Jr. (Rollerblade), C. William Pollard (The ServiceMaster Company) and Marilyn Carlson Nelson (Carlson Companies). Many leaders, whether newly indoctrinated to the world of business or veteran executives, will find tools for the trade in this excellent guidebook to living out one's faith in a ruthless "bottom-line" world. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Friends for 350 Years: The History and Beliefs of the Society of Friends Since George Fox Started the Quaker Movement</h2><p>Friends For #00 Years.

But when she unexpectedly falls for a mysterious cosplayer, things become complicated. What do you do when you love someone who is going miles away from you in just a couple of days?! Web-comic vet Svetlana Chmakova gives us a funny, romantic, behind-the-scenes look at an anime convention-where sometimes even two is a crowd!</p><p>Set at a comic convention, this story shouldn't be as entertaining and fun as it is. But it's a little gem: the plot trips along, and though the art is good, not breathtaking, the Russian-born Canadian artist/author has clearly mastered the now international visual language of manga. The heroine is Chris, a self-willed girl who is taken for granted by her boyfriend, Derek. Chris meets the dark and mysterious Matt, who seems to understand her completely, and hijinks ensue. Sounds corny as hell, but the narrative is smart, witty and moving. The characters tap into the manga archetypes, which makes them breathe and have moments of being larger-than-life. Chris goes through self-doubt to self-knowledge and learns a bit of bravery along the way. It's astonishing to reflect that all the action takes place in the hotel rooms and convention floors where kids sell their homemade comics. Under the noses of adults, these "cons" have slipped into popular culture as a new land of rebels, mentors and wisdom&#x2014;what road trips and the Haight once were. They're a perfect place for a growing-up story. Using every visual manga convention to its fullest, this ripping little tale is strong and expressive enough to reveal real emotional depth. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Down by the river, there are the harvesters with their pitchforks, fanning out across the fields, some already at work.<br><br>A young boy looks down on them. They are far away, and he sees that they are talking quietly and seriously, eager to get on with a day&#x2019;s work. Over his shoulder is an empty leather bag; he is going for the water which the men will soon need when the sun rises higher. The stream is cool from the hills beyond, which mark the end of their world. He does not know what lies outside it. His entire universe is here, the few villages with their rivalries, the seasonal round of crops, animals and festivities.<br><br>He is about to leave it for ever.<br><br>His name is Jay. He is eleven years old and is an entirely normal boy apart from his tendency to bother people with questions. Why are you doing this? What is that for? What are these? His insatiable �curiosity&#x2014;�considered unseemly by his elders and tiresome by those of his own �age&#x2014;�means that he has few friends but, on the whole, he is, as his mother continually tells people, no trouble really.<br><br>Today the boy&#x2019;s mind is empty. It is too glorious, and he knows that the warmth on his back and the brilliant sunshine will not last much longer. Already the birds are gathering, preparing for their departure; he does not want to waste a moment in thought. He reaches the stream and kneels down to bathe, feeling the icy cold on his face and his neck, washing away the sweat. Then he bends over and drinks, cupping the water in his hands and slurping it up.<br><br>He sits back on his haunches, staring at the water as it reflects the sun in its path, listening to the birds and the gentle sound of the breeze in the trees on the other side of the stream. Then he hears an odd noise, low, even almost melodic. It stops, and Jay shakes his head, then unslings the leather bag to begin filling it.<br><br>The noise starts up again, the same tone, like the wind humming through a gap in a window board in winter. It is coming from the other side of a great outcrop of rock which forces the stream to curve in its path down the hill. He gets up, dusts the earth from his bare knees, and wades through the water to where he thinks the sound is coming from.<br><br>There is an overhang in the rock, and under it an indentation which forms a small cave. It is dark inside, with the faint, but not unpleasant, smell of rotting vegetation. He peers intently, but sees nothing. It is very perplexing, but no more than that. He is not afraid.<br><br>He remembers he has a job to do and is about to go back across the stream to the water bag when he sees a sudden slice of light inside the cave. He starts, and blinks, but he has made no mistake. The light is getting larger. Not bright, just brighter than the surrounding darkness, sufficient only to illuminate the gloom; he can see the ferns, with drops of water hanging off the fronds, the shape of the rocks at the back, the moss and lichen growing over everything.<br><br>Then he sees a figure in the light. Hazy, difficult to make out, but definitely a person of some sort. He knows all the stories about the creatures of the woods; the devils and demons, the fairies and the monsters. It is why no one goes there alone, not even in a cold winter when fuel is short. The woods are dangerous to anyone who ventures in unprotected.<br><br>Now he realises all the stories were true; his feet and legs are under a mysterious power which stops them obeying his commands to run. He tries to �sing&#x2014;�the other way of deterring �evil&#x2014;�but no sound comes from his mouth. It is too late.<br><br>The figure steps forward and stops. It has seen him. Jay feels he should go down on his knees and beg for mercy, but he can&#x2019;t do that either. He just stands, mute, trembling and helpless.<br><br>He instinctively casts his eyes down to the earth, but still sneaks a glance through his eyelashes. What he sees gives him hope. It is a fairy, that is certain. It has the form of a girl, scarcely bigger than he is, but its face is �gentle&#x2014;�although all the world knows that could change in an instant.<br><br>He puts his fingertips together and brings them to his lips as he bows, then looks up. The fairy smiles, and he relaxes a little. He got that right, at least. Fairies are sticklers for politeness, and once you have been polite to them and they have accepted the courtesy, they are bound to be peaceable back. So he has heard.<br><br>Better still, it then repeats his gesture, and bows back to him! He almost laughs out loud in relief and astonishment, but this unexpected response gesture robs him of any notion of what to do next. So he makes a mistake, stepping out of the rules which the stories have handed down. He speaks.<br><br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;<br><br>The creature looks angry, and he regrets his words bitterly.<br><br>&#x201c;I apologise, my lady,&#x201d; he blurts out in the old language, the words of respect he has heard in tales. &#x201c;How may I serve you?&#x201d;<br><br>It smiles once more, a radiant, celestial smile that brings the warmth back to his body. It raises its hands in what he takes to be a gesture of �peace&#x2014;�and is gone.<br><br>...<br><br>Henry Lytten laid down the manuscript he had been reading and peered over his glasses at his audience. He always did that. It was an affected, donnish sort of mannerism, but nobody minded or even noticed. They all had their own affectations and they were long used to his.<br><br>&#x201c;Bit of Ovid in there,&#x201d; one said, screwing up his eyes and examining the ceiling. &#x201c;Amores 3, if I recall. You&#x2019;re plagiarising again.&#x201d; He never looked directly at people when he spoke.<br><br>&#x201c;So I am,&#x201d; Lytten said. &#x201c;Consider it a subtle allusion to the pastoral tradition.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If I must.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that all?&#x201d; another asked, beer mug in one hand, pipe in the other, a trail of tobacco ash falling onto the old wooden table as he spoke. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a bit short for twenty years&#x2019; work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Lytten replied. &#x201c;Do you want more?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where are the dragons? A whole chapter, and not a single dragon?&#x201d;<br><br>Lytten scowled. &#x201c;There are no dragons.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No dragons?&#x201d; said the other in mock astonishment. &#x201c;What about �wizards?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Trolls?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Nothing of the sort.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank God for that. Go on.&#x201d;<br><br>It was a very small pub, and shortly after noon on a Saturday. The tiny windows let in little light even at the front; in the room at the back it was almost totally dark, the occasional shaft of illumination from the back door cutting a beam through the thick tobacco smoke which already filled the room. All around were bare walls decorated only with small mirrors, the �once-�white paint stained yellow by years of smoke. The four men occupied the entire area; occasionally someone else would stick a head through and be met with frowns. The landlord discouraged such interruptions. The group had the back room on a Saturday. They came every week for a few hours of masculine conversation, none of them even thinking of being at home with their wives and families. They were more used to the company of other men, and if asked why they had married in the first place, many of Lytten&#x2019;s friends and colleagues would have had difficulty coming up with an answer.<br><br>Lytten, who had paused so that he could make sure that the �others really did want to hear what he had written and weren&#x2019;t just being polite, sipped his beer, then picked up his pile of paper once more. &#x201c;Very well. You can&#x2019;t say I didn&#x2019;t give you a choice. Pay attention now.&#x201d;<br><br>Jay was trembling and in tears by the time he got back to the fields; he headed for the women working away from the men, instinctively thinking they would be more understanding. With a surge of relief, he saw his mother, the brown scarf knotted around her head to keep off the sun. He shouted and ran, buried himself into her warm and comforting body, shaking and sobbing uncontrollably.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it? Jay, what&#x2019;s happened?&#x201d;<br><br>She examined him quickly, checking for injuries. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; She bent down level with his face and scrutinised him, holding him by the shoulders. The other women gathered round. &#x201c;Had a fright,&#x201d; said an old woman there to supervise the younger ones.<br><br>Jay was sure they wouldn&#x2019;t believe him. Who would? They would think he was just trying to get out of work. His mother would be ashamed of him, would say he was letting the family down.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; his mother said more urgently.<br><br>&#x201c;I saw . . . I saw a . . . I don&#x2019;t know. I saw someone. Something. Up there. It just appeared in a cave. Out of nothing. Then vanished again.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a titter of nervous laughter; his mother looked alarmed and annoyed at the same time.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean? Where?&#x201d;<br><br>He pointed back up the hill. &#x201c;Beyond the stream,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;In the woods?&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to go there. But I heard a strange noise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s making it up,&#x201d; a woman said: Dell, a gossip who never had a good word to say for anyone. She&#x2019;d once been beautiful, it was said, but the hardness in her face had long since covered any loveliness. Her scorn was enough to make Jay&#x2019;s mother straighten up with defiance.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go and look,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Come on, Jay. I&#x2019;m sure it was just a trick of the light. You had a fright, but don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d;<br><br>Her kindness was reassuring and, ignoring the others who clearly now thought this was some sort of childish joke, Jay&#x2019;s mother took him by the hand. Only one other woman came as well, the eldest of them, who thought it her duty to be present at every disturbance, however minor. Everyone else got back to work.<br><br>Jay retraced his steps to the stream, then over it and into the woods. The old widow bowed and muttered to herself to ward off the spirits until they all stood once more, looking into the cave. There was nothing. No sound, no light, and certainly no fairy.<br><br>&#x201c;It was just here. It really was,&#x201d; he said, looking to see whether they were angry or dismissive. He got no hint, though; their expressions were completely unreadable.<br><br>&#x201c;What did this fairy look like?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A girl,&#x201d; Jay said. &#x201c;She had dark hair. She smiled at me. She was so �beautiful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How was she dressed?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, like nothing you have ever seen! A red robe, shiny and glittering, like it was made of rubies.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve never seen a ruby,&#x201d; the old widow said. &#x201c;How would you know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It shone in the light, dazzlingly bright,&#x201d; he insisted. &#x201c;It was wonderful. Then she just disappeared.&#x201d;<br><br>The women looked at each other, then shrugged helplessly. &#x201c;Well, there&#x2019;s nothing here now,&#x201d; his mother said. &#x201c;So I think it would be best to forget about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Listen, Jay. This is important,&#x201d; said the old widow. She bent down and looked him firmly in the eyes. &#x201c;Not a word. You understand? The sooner this is forgotten the better. You don&#x2019;t want a reputation for being mad, or a trickster, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>He shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;Good. Now, if I hear that you&#x2019;ve been talking about this, then I&#x2019;ll give you the biggest beating of your life, and I&#x2019;m a strong old woman. Now, get your water, and let&#x2019;s go back to work.&#x201d;<br><br>There was an atmosphere for the rest of the day, an odd div�ision between the men, who knew nothing, worked cheerfully and well, and the women, whose mood was subdued, almost fearful. Jay himself remained shaken; he knew, or rather he hoped, that he had not been dreaming. But he also realised that it was unlikely anyone would ever believe him.<br><br>Lytten glanced at his companions and smiled briefly. Most were, like him, men in their fifties; all had the �care-�worn, slightly shabby look of their type. None cared much for elegant clothes, preferring battered tweeds and comfortable, solid shoes. The collars of their shirts were frayed, except for those whose wives turned their shirts before admitting they were beyond repair. The jackets had leather patches sewn onto the elbows to prolong their life; most had socks that had been carefully, and repeatedly, darned. They were, he supposed, his closest friends, people he had known in some cases for decades. Yet he didn&#x2019;t really think of them as friends, or even as colleagues. He didn&#x2019;t really know what they were. Just part of his life; the people he spent Saturday with, after some had been in the library and others had worked on the business of teaching for an hour or two.<br><br>All of them had a secret passion, which they hid carefully from most of the world. They liked stories. Some had a weakness for detective tales, and had volumes of �green-�backed Penguins stacked out of sight behind the �leather-�bound books on �Anglo-�Saxon history or classical philosophy. Others had an equally fervent and illicit love of science fiction, and adored nothing better than curling up with a tale of interstellar exploration in between lectures on the evolution and reception of the �nineteenth-�century Russian novel. Others preferred spy stories and adventures, whether Rider Haggard or Buchan or (for the more raffish) James Bond.<br><br>Lytten had a weakness for fantastical tales of imaginary lands, peopled (if that was the word) by dragons and trolls and goblins. It was what had drawn him, many years before, into the company of Lewis and Tolkien.<br><br>It was an enthusiasm which had taken possession of him when he was thirteen, packed off to bed for four months with measles, then mumps, then chicken pox. So he read. And read, and read. There was nothing else to do; there wasn&#x2019;t yet even a wireless set to listen to. While his mother kept on bringing him worthy and improving works to read, his father would smuggle in nonsense. Tales of knights and fair maidens, of gods and goddesses, of quests and adventures. He would read, then lie back and dream, improving the stories where he thought the authors had gone wrong. The dragons would become nastier, the women cleverer, the men less boringly virtuous.<br><br>Eventually he had started penning such stories himself, but was always too reticent to show them to anyone. He went to war, then became a scholar, a man of intellectual distinction, and the stories were left unfinished. Besides, it was all very well to criticise the works of others, but in fact it was quite hard, he discovered, to tell a story. His first efforts were not that much better than those he so easily faulted.<br><br>Gradually he formed a new ambition, and it was this that he was now, on a quiet Saturday in October 1960, going to reveal in all its as yet unfinished glory to his friends in the pub. He had spent years discussing the efforts of others; now, after much prodding, it was his turn.<br><br>He hoped they would be responsive; members had come and gone over the years, and the best had �disappeared&#x2014;�Lewis sick in Cambridge, Tolkien in retirement, becoming too famous and too old to write much any more. He missed them; he would have enjoyed watching Lewis&#x2019;s face.<br><br>&#x201c;Very well, gentlemen, if you could put your drinks down and pay attention, then I will explain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;About time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In brief . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Surely not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In brief, I am creating the world.&#x201d;<br><br>He stopped and looked around.

When the family is forced by the newly formed State of Israel to leave their ancestral home, only Nazmiyeh and her brother survive the long road to Gaza.

It draws on the latest findings in archaeology and history to explain the meanings of rituals, rites, auspices, and oracles, to describe the uses of temples and sacred ground, and to evoke the daily patterns of religious life and observance within the city of Rome and its environs. The text is usefully organized around major themes, such as the origins of Roman religion, the importance of the religious calendar, the structure of religious space, the forms of religious services and rituals, and the gods, priests, and core theologies that shaped religious observance. In addition to its clear and accessible presentation, Roman Religion includes quotations from primary sources, a chronology of religious and historical events from 750 B.C. to A.D. 494, a full glossary, and an annotated guide to further reading.</p><p><p>"Lacking (apparently) a native mythology or images of its gods, Roman religion has always seemed barren to scholars. Without anything much to interpret, interpretation has regularly fallen into minutely descriptive lists of gods and rituals. Among recent efforts, Beard, North, and Price's Religions of Rome (CH, Feb'99) offers both sources and interpretations, but is essentially a reference book. Robert Turcan's The Gods of Ancient Rome (2000) offers an innovative and historically grounded interpretation (without the lists), while Valerie Warrior's Roman Religion (2002) sticks to sources without the history. Scheid (ancient history, �cole (Ecole) Pratiques des Hautes �tudes (Etudes), Paris), one of the most distinguished scholars of Roman religion, now offers a brilliant, historically grounded interpretation that will interest scholars as well as the students (French, originally) for whom it was written. The theme of each chapter--methodology, structure, rituals, actors, interpretations of Roman religion--is carefully developed. A chronology and bibliography support the whole. Lists of facts, questions (with concise, informative answers), and original sources are inset at appropriate places in the main text. Scheid is insightful, concise, and original.

Robert Hughes called the second volume "a masterpiece in the making, the most illuminating biography yet written on a twentieth-century visual artist and the only one that can sustain comparison with Painter on Proust, Ellman on Joyce, or Edel on Henry James"; he also praised Richardson's "crispness of writing" and "impressive eye for the offbeat or scandalous detail." All these qualities conspire to make <b>The Sorcerer's Apprentice</b> a brilliant and fascinating chronicle.<br><br>This book is a sharply etched portrait of Douglas Cooper, the colorful Evelyn Waugh-like figure who single-handedly assembled the world's most important private cubist collection. It is also the story of Cooper and Richardson's association, which began in 1949 and came to fruition -- and ultimately disaster -- at the Chateau de Castille, the eighteenth-century colonnaded folly in Provence that they restored and filled with masterpieces by Picasso, Braque, Leger, and Juan Gris. Besides these artists and the women in their lives, Jean Cocteau, W. H. Auden, Cyril Connolly, Marie-Laure de Noailles, Helena Rubenstein, Peggy Guggenheim, and Anthony Blunt are just some of the figures who, through Richardson's insightful prose, leap off the page to appear before us in an entirely new light. A major revelation of the book is its portrait of Picasso in private; Richardson's friendship with the artist coincided with a period of dramatic change in the artist's life. Not since Gertrude Stein's <b>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</b> has anyone given so intimate a picture of leading modern artists and their circle at work and play, or with such insight and understanding.<br><br>The flawless style, highly tuned sensitivity, and incisive wit of <b>The Sorcerer's Apprentice</b> make it one of the most entertaining and captivating memoirs of one of the great periods of artistic activity in this century.</p><p>Two quotations from Francis Bacon bookend this curious, exasperatedly affectionate memoir by John Richardson, distinguished art historian and 1991 Whitbread Award-winning biographer of Picasso: the prophetic "she'll try to lure you to bed, and then she'll turn on you. She always does," finds its uncanny conclusion in "Didn't I warn you she was a thoroughly treacherous woman?" The sorcerer (art collector Douglas Cooper) and his apprentice (Richardson) lived for 10 years in the grandiose "folly" Ch�teau de Castille in Provence, where they entertained a circle that included Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Angus Wilson, Tennessee Williams, and a range of other usual suspects from that period's artistic fraternity. When Richardson left Cooper for the lights of New York, Cooper, in the great tradition of spurned lovers, burned Richardson's remaining possessions, stole his paintings, denounced him to friends and employers, and even attempted to arrange his arrest by Interpol. Cooper was a duplicitous, sadistic bully (among his more outrageous acts was loudly booing the queen outside Westminster Abbey at her coronation). But his deep knowledge of art history and classical cubism and his pioneering collecting of the works of Picasso, Braque, L�ger, and Gris were an essential counterpoint to the staid policy of the Tate Gallery and its director, Sir John Rothenstein, for whom he held a deteriorating scorn. Richardson's delight in reviewing this formative period reignites the fire in Cooper flaring nostrils and borrows some of its flame to stoke what is arguably an enriching addendum to his Picasso magnum opus, which, appropriately, bears a dedication to his old sorcerer. <i>--David Vincent, Amazon.co.uk</i>Praise for John Richardson's <b>A Life of Picasso</b><br><br>"As I read it, my education simply advanced by one great step.

Chronicling the story of New York from its establishment as a Dutch trading post in 1624 to its global preeminence today, the book is at once the biography of a great city and a vivid exploration of the myriad forces -- commercial, cultural, demographic -- that converged in New York to usher in the contemporary world.<br><br>Weaving the strands of the city's sweeping history into a single compelling narrative, New York carries us through nearly four centuries of turbulent growth and change -- from the first settlement on the tip of "Manna-hata" Island to the destruction wrought by the Revolutionary War; to the city's stunning emergence in the nineteenth century as the nation's premier industrial metropolis; to the waves of early-twentieth-century immigration that forever transformed the city and the nation; to New York's transfiguration as the world's first modern city -- pioneering skyscrapers, apartment houses, subways, and highways -- and its role as the birthplace of so much of American popular culture. Along the way, we witness the building of the city's celebrated landmarks and neighborhoods, from the Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of Liberty to the Empire State Building and the United Nations; from Wall Street and Times Square to the Lower East Side, Harlem, and SoHo.<br><br>The book brims with vibrant illustrations, including hundreds of rare photographs, paintings, lithographs, prints, and period maps.

P. Morgan, Al Smith, F. Scott Fitzgerald, George Gershwin, Fiorello La Guardia, Robert Moses, and Jane Jacobs.<br><br>Accompanying the book's narrative are interviews with Robert A. Caro, David Levering Lewis, and Robert A. M. Stern, and essays by a group of distinguished New York historians and critics -- Kenneth T. Jackson, Mike Wallace, Marshall Berman, Phillip Lopate, Carol Berkin, and Daniel Czitrom -- who add their insights about the city to this splendid history.</p><p>There are a million stories in the wicked city, and <i>New York: An Illustrated History</i> contains hundreds of them. From its 17th-century beginnings as a small Dutch colony on the far edge of an empire to its late-20th-century status as one of the world's greatest cities, New York has been home to millions of fascinating people. Take, for example, Edward Hyde, royal governor of New York from 1702 to 1708. Hyde, cousin of Queen Anne, was heartily disliked by the colonists--in part because he was reputed to dress in women's clothing ("I represent a woman, and ought in all respects to resemble her as faithfully as I can," Hyde was reported to have said). Or Al Smith, son of immigrants, a day laborer, who worked his way up the political ladder and eventually became Governor of New York. Or Rosie Safran, a seamstress who survived the horrible fire that claimed 146 of her coworkers at the Triangle shirtwaist factory.<p> PBS darling Ric Burns (brother of Ken) teamed up with James Sanders and Lisa Ades to produce this spectacular volume and the accompanying 12-hour series. Some 500 illustrations enhance the narrative, while essays by and interviews with prominent New Yorkers-- Robert A. Caro, Carol Berkin, and David Levering Lewis among them--highlight their visions of the metropolis, past and present. New Yorkers or not, readers will enjoy stories of how the city grew and changed over time--such as in 1699, when the old Dutch city wall was torn down and a later-to-be-famous street laid out in its place; or in a 10-day period in 1930, when 14 new floors of the Empire State Building were erected. Along the way, the authors debunk a few myths: the Dutch didn't really pay only $24 for Manhattan, and no immigrant's name was known to have been changed by the Ellis Island inspectors--though the ships' manifests they were consulting may have been incorrect.</p><p> Burns and company are clearly enamored of New York, seeing it as "the ultimate city of dreaming and desire, a place of passage and transformation, of possibility and exchange, of mingled cultures and identities." They also see New York, with all its ups, downs, problems, and triumphs, as a microcosm of the modern world. Lavish, thorough, and pleasantly warm, <i>New York: An Illustrated History</i> reminds us that, yes, it's a wonderful town. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>&#x201c;This book combines striking illustrations with scintillating essays to produce <br>a superb history of the world&#x2019;s first city.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;Arthur Schlesinger Jr.<br>&#x201c;A ravishing book . . .

The Life of Saint Louis, by Joinville, was inspired by the author&#39;s close attachment to the pious King Louis, and focuses on the years between 1226 and 1270.

That&#x2019;s not just a children&#x2019;s fairy tale&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a good description of many of the most amazing people I&#x2019;ve encountered.</p><p>And while they may live and work in different countries and in different fields, they all share the same core giving philosophy. This book captures that philosophy and shows that it is more than a fable, a parable, or a pipe dream. It&#x2019;s real&#x2014;a path that people can follow in their daily lives.</p><p>People want to believe that this is the way the world <i>can</i> work: that living with a focus on others isn&#x2019;t just a nice goal but that it can be a way of life, and can lead to a life that is full, rich and fulfilling. But then, too often, we feel pressured by the voices (both external and internal) of cynicism and resignation, telling us, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a dog-eat-dog world out there&#x2014;you&#x2019;ve got to look out for #1.&#x201d;</p><p>Too many people think, &#x201c;Oh, sure, once you&#x2019;ve achieved success and financial stability, <i>then</i> you can afford to be a giving person!&#x201d; But in this book, Bob Burg and John David Mann&#x2014;who, among other things, have given us the term <i>go-giver</i>&#x2014;tell us that, in fact, being a giving person is how you achieve success in the first place, however you define success.</p><p>Too often people hear &#x201c;be a giver&#x201d; and think of charities and writing checks, of &#x201c;giving back&#x201d; once we have already done well for ourselves. But that&#x2019;s only one very specific facet of giving. By &#x201c;be a giver,&#x201d; Bob and John mean be a giving person, <i>period:</i> one who gives thought, gives attention, gives care, gives focus, gives time and energy&#x2014;gives <i>value</i> to others.</p><p>Not as a quid pro quo, not as a strategy to get ahead, but because it is, in and of itself, a satisfying and fulfilling way to be.</p><p>Arianna Huffington</p><p></p><p></p><p>Introduction to the Revised Edition</p><p>Not long after <i>The Go-Giver </i>first appeared, we got a letter from a man named Arlin Sorensen. The CEO of an Iowa IT firm, Arlin had organized a Go-Giver&#x2013;themed summer retreat for more than two hundred peer-group companies. Inspired by the ideas in the book, several conference participants flew out to another state, on their own dime, to help brainstorm solutions for a colleague whose company was on the verge of closure. The firm pulled back from the brink and saw banner profits the following quarter&#x2014;and the two men who&#x2019;d done the consulting were surprised to find that what they learned in the process helped boost growth in their <i>own </i>companies, too.</p><p>All of which, Arlin told us, was a result of his reading our &#x201c;little story about a powerful business idea.&#x201d;</p><p>And Arlin wasn&#x2019;t the only one sending us reports like this. People in all sorts of businesses started telling us that our story was changing the way they did things. Chambers of Commerce told us they were adopting Go-Giver precepts as part of their professional code and giving copies of the book to their members to help their businesses become more successful. A fitness club challenged its staff to continually come up with creative improvements in the business based on the book&#x2019;s core principles. A legal firm reported using the book to help more effectively negotiate matrimonial disputes.</p><p><i>The Go-Giver </i>started as a book but soon became a movement. Our hero Joe&#x2019;s struggle to gain an advantage in his business (some &#x201c;clout and leverage,&#x201d; as he put it) and his encounters with his mentor&#x2019;s counterintuitive principles describing how the world <i>really</i> works (&#x201c;the more you give, the more you have&#x201d;) seemed to strike a chord&#x2014;and not only in the world of business. Before long we were hearing from parents, teachers, pastors and counselors who were using the book in their work, and in their lives, too.</p><p>� A high school teacher in Indiana told us he was taking his school&#x2019;s senior class through the book because he found it &#x201c;better equipped them to do well in the world.&#x201d; He has done it with every graduating class since.</p><p>� An executive chef at an exclusive Houston country club started using it to train his management team to reach even higher levels of excellence and member satisfaction.</p><p>� A Lithuanian expat in London moved back to her homeland and started her own publishing company just so she could share the book with her compatriots in their own language. &#x201c;Your book will change our country,&#x201d; she told us.</p><p>From book clubs to executive councils, law firms to prayer groups, energy conglomerates to nursing homes, pizza shop managers to graduate school professors, people wrote to tell us how they were using the book. And it wasn&#x2019;t that they were saying they liked it. They were saying something better than that.</p><p>They were saying it <i>worked</i>.</p><p>Business owners told us the book helped them make their businesses more successful. In some cases, struggling businesses experienced a complete turnaround after implementing the &#x201c;Five Laws of Stratospheric Success&#x201d; Joe learns in these pages. Companies large and small started using it to train their sales and customer service teams to generate both more sales <i>and </i>happier customers. People reported using the Five Laws to great effect in their marriages and approach to parenting.</p><p>All of the foregoing might seem to suggest that the &#x201c;secrets&#x201d; in <i>The Go-Giver </i>must be startlingly new and original. They aren&#x2019;t, of course. The ideas here are as old as humanity. One of the messages we hear most often is some variation of &#x201c;This is how I always <i>thought </i>(or always <i>hoped</i>) things worked.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I just never quite knew how to put it into words.&#x201d; When these readers crack open the pages of Joe&#x2019;s adventure, they tell us, they discover something they always knew somewhere inside themselves: that while the world may at times appear to be a dog-eat-dog place, there is actually a set of much kinder and vastly more powerful principles operating beneath the surface of casual appearances.</p><p>But don&#x2019;t take our word for it.</p><p>After reading what Joe and his mentor Pindar have to say, we invite you to take the next step and explore it for yourself. Follow Pindar&#x2019;s Condition: test every law you read here and see what happens. &#x201c;Not by thinking about it,&#x201d; as Pindar tells Joe in chapter 2, &#x201c;not by talking about it, but by applying it in your life.&#x201d;</p><p>Enjoy&#x2014;and our best wishes for your <i>stratospheric success</i>.</p><p>Bob Burg and John David Mann</p><p>October 2015</p><p></p><p></p><p>1: The Go-Getter</p><p>If there was anyone at the Clason-Hill Trust Corporation who was a go-getter, it was Joe. He worked hard, worked fast, and was headed for the top. At least, that was his plan. Joe was an ambitious young man, aiming for the stars.</p><p>Still, sometimes it felt as if the harder and faster he worked, the further away his goals appeared. For such a dedicated go-getter, it seemed like he was doing a lot of <i>going</i> but not a lot of <i>getting</i>.</p><p>Work being as busy as it was, though, Joe didn&#x2019;t have much time to think about that. Especially on a day like today&#x2014;a Friday, with only a week left in the quarter and a critical deadline to meet. A deadline he couldn&#x2019;t afford <i>not</i> to meet.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Today, in the waning hours of the afternoon, Joe decided it was time to call in a favor, so he placed a phone call&#x2014;but the conversation wasn&#x2019;t going well.</p><p>&#x201c;Carl, tell me you&#x2019;re not telling me this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Joe took a breath to keep the desperation out of his voice. &#x201c;Neil Hansen?! Who the heck is Neil Hansen?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well I don&#x2019;t care what he&#x2019;s offering, we can meet those specs&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wait&#x2014;c&#x2019;mon, Carl, you owe me one! You know you do! Hey, who saved your bacon on the Hodges account? Carl, hang on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Carl!&#x201d;</p><p>Joe clicked off the TALK button on his cordless phone and made himself calmly set down the instrument. He took a deep breath.</p><p>Joe was desperately trying to land a large account, an account he felt he richly deserved&#x2014;one he <i>needed</i>, if he wanted to make his third-quarter quota. Joe had just missed his quota in the first quarter, and again in the second. Two strikes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Joe didn&#x2019;t even want to think about a third.</p><p>&#x201c;Joe? You okay?&#x201d; a voice asked. Joe looked up into the concerned face of his coworker Melanie Matthews. Melanie was a well-meaning, genuinely nice person. Which was exactly why Joe doubted she would survive long in a competitive environment like the seventh floor, where they both worked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Was that Carl Kellerman on the phone? About the BK account?&#x201d;</p><p>Joe sighed. &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t need to explain. Everyone on the floor knew who Carl Kellerman was. He was a corporate broker looking for the right firm to handle an account Joe had nicknamed the Big Kahuna, or BK for short.</p><p>According to Carl, the boss at Big Kahuna didn&#x2019;t think Joe&#x2019;s firm had the &#x201c;clout and leverage&#x201d; to put the deal together. Now some character he&#x2019;d never heard of had underbid and outperformed him. Carl claimed there was nothing he could do about it.</p><p>&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t get it,&#x201d; Joe said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry, Joe,&#x201d; said Melanie.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, sometimes you eat the bear&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He flashed a confident grin, but all he could think about was what Carl had said. As Melanie walked back to her desk, Joe sat lost in thought. <i>Clout and leverage</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Moments later he leaped up and walked over to Melanie&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;Hey, Mel?&#x201d;</p><p>She looked up.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you remember talking with Gus the other day, something about a big wheel consultant giving a talk somewhere next month? You called him the Captain or something?&#x201d;</p><p>Melanie smiled. &#x201c;Pindar. The Chairman.&#x201d;</p><p>Joe snapped his fingers. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it! That&#x2019;s the guy. What&#x2019;s his last name?&#x201d;</p><p>Melanie frowned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She shrugged. &#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever heard it mentioned. Everyone calls him the Chairman, or just Pindar. Why? You want to go hear the talk?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe.&#x201d; But Joe was not interested in some lecture happening a month away. He was interested in only one thing&#x2014;and that one thing needed to happen by the following Friday, when the third quarter came to an end.</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking, this guy is a real heavy hitter, right? Charges huge consulting fees, works only for the biggest and best firms? <i>Major</i> clout. I know we could handle the BK account, but I&#x2019;m gonna need some big guns to win the deal back. I need <i>leverage</i>. Any idea how I can get a line to this Chairman guy&#x2019;s office?&#x201d;</p><p>Melanie looked at Joe as if he were proposing to wrestle a grizzly bear. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just going to call him up?!&#x201d;</p><p>Joe shrugged. &#x201c;Sure. Why not?&#x201d;</p><p>Melanie shook her head. &#x201c;I have no idea how to contact him. Why don&#x2019;t you ask Gus?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>As Joe headed back to his desk, he wondered how Gus had managed to survive this long at Clason-Hill Trust. He never saw him do any actual <i>work</i>. Yet Gus had an enclosed office, while Joe, Melanie and a dozen others shared the open space of the seventh floor. Some said Gus had gotten his office because of seniority. Others said he&#x2019;d earned it on merit.</p><p></p></p><h2>Metals and How to Weld Them</h2><p>Metals and How to Weld Them</p><p></p><h2>The Magic of Fire: Hearth Cooking: One Hundred Recipes for the Fireplace or Campfire</h2><p>2003 James Beard Award NomineeThe open hearth is where American colonials baked their beans, English families took their tea, French country families prepared their pot au feu, and Italian mothers stirred their polenta. THE MAGIC OF FIRE explores both the techniques of hearth cooking and the poetry of hearth and flame through the ages. The recipe collection offers a fascinating glimpse into the past with authentic renditions of Brisket Baked under Ashes, Pot Roast, String-Roasted Turkey, Stockfish Stew, Chocolat Ancienne, and Tarte Tatin. With its evocative and erudite narrative and extraordinary paintings by master realist Ian Everard, THE MAGIC OF FIRE is the definitive work on open-hearth cooking. &#x201a;Ģ The first book to cover the complete range of open-hearth cooking techniques, including ash baking, ember roasting, hearthside grilling, string- and spit-roasting, and hearthside Dutch oven baking.&#x201a;Ģ Features 100 extraordinary illustrations of food and fire by master realist Ian Everard.&#x201a;Ģ Many of the recipes require no special equipment. Simply open the book, light a fire, and cook.Reviews"Definitive book on cooking." &#x201a;��Paula Wolfert, author of Mediterranean Grains and Greens, The Cooking of Southwest France"THE MAGIC OF FIRE is the most thoughtful and thorough study of hearth cooking I know of. His book is full of practical information (the section All about the Fireplace is a masterpiece), unconventional recipes, and fascinating historical references that link his modern perspective to this primitive art. It will inspire professionals as well as serious home cooks to recover the taste that only hearth cooking can deliver. " &#x201a;��Paul Bertolli, chef and owner, Oliveto Cafe &amp; Restaurant, author of Chez Panisse Cooking"There is something fundamental about cooking over an open fire. I love the flames, I love the smells, and of course, I love the taste. William Rubel's THE MAGIC OF FIRE, is an indispensable guide to this lost art." &#x201a;��Alice Waters, chef and owner, Chez Panisse"THE MAGIC OF FIRE is a fabulous book! It's about flames and ashes; tripods and spider pots; campfires, hearths, and fireplaces. It's about ember-roasted vegetables, flat breads, stews, steamed puddings, salt cod&#x201a;��deeply fundamental foods that will make you see the possibilities of your fireplace in a new light. Passion, experience, and good writing have met in a book that's good reading, with instructions that are clear as a bell." &#x201a;��Deborah Madison"It's a fun read, particularly for those who have always been fascinated by early American history." &#x201a;��The Baltimore Sun "The bible of hearth cooking." &#x201a;��House &amp; Garden "[An] enchanting, step-by-step, illustrated field guide." &#x201a;��The Philadelphia Inquirer "A seemingly romantic concept that the author insists is quite practical." &#x201a;��Sarasota Herald Tribune "If you're looking for something totally different, I'd dare say you probably won't find another book like this one." &#x201a;��National Barbecue News The best instruction of skillful cooking on the hearth now in print.&#x201a;�� &#x201a;��The Journal of Antiques and Collectibles"</p><p>Why cook by the hearth when our modern stoves offer such convenience? William Rubel's remarkable <i>The Magic of Fire</i> provides unexpected answers to the question, not immediately apparent to those interested in pursuing live-fire cooking and the intense flavors it produces. To be sure, the book is definitive in its exploration of open-hearth technique; readers learn everything they need to know about equipment, methods (including ash baking, ember roasting, and hearthside grilling, among others), and even about fire itself (it has various life stages, each best for a particular cooking task). Rubel also provides 100 delicious hearthside recipes for fundamental foods like roasted red peppers, ember-baked fish, pot roasts, and desserts, including bread pudding and baked apples--formulas he conscientiously walks us through.<p>But the book's greatest--and most exciting--virtue lies in its presentation of fire cooking not merely as a "hobbyist" project but as a means for understanding cooking itself. It does this by revealing the relationship of fire to the things it cooks; in learning, for example, that a hearthside frittata requires "a moderately mature fire with gentle to moderate flames" to cook while simple toast needs "a new to moderately mature fire with moderate to high flames," we begin to see just how cooking works. For anyone interested in this everyday but still magical feat, this is thrilling stuff. With over 100 color illustrations of the required fires (whose preparation is thoroughly detailed); a discussion of alternative cooking "venues," including campsites; and a useful food glossary, this guide, both practical and illuminating, is an unexpected treasure. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>�The first book to cover the complete range of open-hearth cooking techniques, including ash baking, ember roasting, hearthside grilling, string- and spit-roasting, and hearthside Dutch oven baking. <p>�Features 100 extraordinary illustrations of food and fire by master realist Ian Everard. </p><p>�Many of the recipes require no special equipment.

But I wasn't too weary to type the date line firmly as if I'd been writing date lines all my life:<br><b>from the front at iwo jima march 5--</b><br> Then I remembered and added two words.<br><b>under fire--</b><br> They looked great."<br> In 1965, Wisconsin native Georgette "Dickey" Chapelle became the first female American war correspondent to be killed in action. Now, "Dickey Chapelle Under Fire" shares her remarkable story and offers readers the chance to experience Dickey's wide-ranging photography, including several photographs taken during her final patrol in Vietnam.<br> Dickey Chapelle fought to be taken seriously as a war correspondent and broke down gender barriers for future generations of female journalists. She embedded herself with military units on front lines around the globe, including Iwo Jima and Okinawa, the Dominican Republic, and Vietnam. Dickey sometimes risked her life to tell the story--after smuggling aid to refugees fleeing Hungary, she spent almost two months in a Hungarian prison. For twenty-five years, Dickey's photographs graced the pages of "National Geographic," the "National Observer," "Life," and others. Her tenacity, courage, and compassion shine through in her work, highlighting the human impact of war while telling the bigger story beyond the battlefield.<br> In "Dickey Chapelle Under Fire," the American public can see the world through Dickey's lens for the first time in almost fifty years, with a foreword by Jackie Spinner, former war correspondent for "The Washington Post."<br> &nbsp;</p><p><p><b>John Garofolo</b> is a former entertainment industry executive and veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The Wisconsin native's love of aviation and photography led her to abandon her studies at MIT and hang around military bases instead. She flunked out, married, and persuaded the Navy&#x2014;despite her Navy husband's objections&#x2014;to let her cover the front lines in the Pacific. Chapelle eagerly went on to cover events in Hungary, Algeria, Cuba, Lebanon, the Dominican Republic, and, fatefully, Vietnam. Despite winning awards for her work, she struggled for assignments; when she got them, she earned less pay than her male counterparts. Her arresting black and white photos capture lasting scenes: grotesquely wounded soldiers, children caught in conflict, and summary executions of combatants. But it's a colleague's photo that haunts this book: the 47-year-old Chapelle laying mortally wounded after being hit by shrapnel while on patrol with Marines in South Vietnam. The commandant of the Marine Corps called Chapelle "one of us," and her body of work surely deserves the wider recognition this book provides. 153 b&amp;w photos. <b>(Publisher's Weekly Starred review, Sept. 2015)</b><br><br> John Garofolo's work is not only a fine read, it is a must for any who have experienced combat, especially those of us who continue to tell the Marine Corps story. <b>(Capt Jack T.

For decades, she has traveled the length and breadth of the country, seeking out the home cooks, local ingredients, and traditional recipes that make Mexican cuisines some of the most varied and flavorful in the world. Kennedy has published eight classic Mexican cookbooks, including the James Beard Award-winning Oaxaca al Gusto. But her most personal book is My Mexico, a labor of love filled with more than three hundred recipes and stories that capture the essence of Mexican food culture as Kennedy has discovered and lived it. First published in 1998, My Mexico is now back in print with a fresh design and photographs&#x2014;ready to lead a new generation of gastronomes on an unforgettable journey through the foods of this fascinating and complex country.</p></p><p>A British citizen, Diana Southwood went to Mexico in 1957 to marry Paul P. Kennedy of the New York Times. Today she is widely considered the foremost researcher, teacher, and writer on the regional foods of Mexico and has written eight books on the subject, including The Cuisines of Mexico (now included in The Essential Cuisines of Mexico), The Art of Mexican Cooking, and From My Mexican Kitchen. She has been bestowed the highest honor given to foreigners by the Mexican government, the Order of the Aztec Eagle, for her work of disseminating Mexican culture through its foods. She has also received numerous awards from many other Mexican gastronomic institutions and was decorated with an MBE by Queen Elizabeth for her work in strengthening cultural relations between Mexico and the United Kingdom, as well as for her work for the environment, which is always reflected in her texts. Since 1980, her studies have been centered around her ecological house in the state of Michoac�n."My Mexico is a masterwork. I am thrilled to see it being republished. No other writer has come close to Diana Kennedy in communicating the variety, richness, and delights of the cuisines of Mexico. Reading the book, for it&#x2019;s a great read, is like watching a layered lively video, as images unspool in the mind&#x2019;s eye. Cooking from it is also a pleasure, for directions are clear and results exceptional, in my experience." (Naomi Duguid, author of Burma: Rivers of Flavor)<br><br>"Diana Kennedy stands in the canon of outstanding people like Fanny Calder�n de la Barca, Malcolm Lowry, and Leonora Carrington, who came to Mexico and made the country their own. The uniqueness of Diana Kennedy&#x2019;s journey and brilliant body of work is that she also gave Mexico to itself."

Linenthal is professor of religious studies at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh. He is the author of <i>The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory </i>and <i>Sacred Ground: Americans and their Battlefields.</i></p>President Carter created the President's Commission on the Holocaust in 1978. It then took 15 years of bitter and emotional debate to design and build the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. Linenthal, author of <i>Sacred Grounds: Americans and Their Battlefields</i> (1991), chronicles all that went on during those painful and acrimonious years as Holocaust survivors, politicians, museum professionals, historians, and architects struggled to define "the boundaries of Holocaust memory." Linenthal deftly summarizes all the complex issues that had to be resolved. Jews believed that they should be the focus, but members of other groups victimized by the Holocaust demanded equal representation. Some felt the memorial should be in New York; others fretted over whether Washington, D.C., was an appropriate location. And what an agonizing task it was to create a memorial that both eulogized and educated without simplifying, sensationalizing, or offending. Linenthal portrays major players, including Elie Wiesel, Yaffa Eliach, and architect James Ingo Freed, who was finally able to visualize a building "expressive of the event" after traveling to Auschwitz. A sobering, yet fascinating, testament to the value of preserving memories with respect and creativity. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Finding the Still Point (Book and CD): A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Zen Meditation (Dharma Communications)</h2><p>Through Zen meditation it is possible to find stillness of mind, even amidst our everyday activities&#x2014;and this practical book-and-CD set reveals how. John Daido Loori, one of America's leading Zen teachers, offers everything needed to begin a meditation practice. He covers the basics of where to sit (on a cushion, bench, or chair), how to posture the body (complete with instructional photographs), and how to practice Zen meditation to discover the freedom of a peaceful mind.</p><p>John Daido Loori (1931&#x2013;2009) was one of the West's leading Zen masters. He was the founder and spiritual leader of the Mountains and Rivers Order and abbot of Zen Mountain Monastery. His work has been most noted for its unique adaptation of traditional Asian Buddhism into an American context, particularly with regard to the arts, the environment, social action, and the use of modern media as a vehicle of spiritual training and social change. Loori was an award-winning photographer and videographer. His art and wildlife photography formed the core of a unique teaching program that integrated art and wilderness training by cultivating a deep appreciation of the relationship of Zen to our natural environment. He was a dharma heir of the influential Japanese Zen master Taizan Maezumi Roshi and he authored many books.<i>Starred Review.</i> Loori, the revered and celebrated founder and abbot of Zen Mountain Monastery in New York, has authored numerous books on Zen Buddhist practice (<i>The Eight Gates of Zen</i>). In this ultraslim illustrated primer, Loori distills that experience and wisdom into a resolute and economical guide for beginners. It will likely become a classic. Part One addresses the Zen basics such as meditation positions, hara focus, breathing, walking meditation and home practice. This section is particularly friendly for beginners with its concise instructional essays, most under 1,000 words. Loori's deceptively simple prose, arising from decades of practice and teaching, hits its mark as an arrow hits center target: the means and results are evident, but the flight is elegantly invisible. Part Two, a dharma talk on The Great Way, effectively imparts a direct expression of the spirit of Zen by the teacher to his... students. Tools such as an appropriately short glossary and suggested reading list are complemented by a 70-minute CD (not heard by <i>PW</i>). The CD offers timed zazen sessions of 10 and 30 minutes, plus a brief talk by Loori on the benefits of meditation. This book-and-CD package promises to be a graceful gem in the legendary cosmic Diamond Net. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

So I decided to talk to women about their vaginas, to do vagina interviews, which became vagina monologues. I talked with over two hundred women. I talked to old women, young women, married women, single women, lesbians, college professors, actors, corporate professionals, sex workers, African American women, Hispanic women, Asian American women, Native American women, Caucasian women, Jewish women. At first women were reluctant to talk. They were a little shy.

Adapted from the award-winning one-woman show that's rocked audiences around the world, this groundbreaking book gives voice to a chorus of lusty, outrageous, poignant, and thoroughly human stories, transforming the question mark hovering over the female anatomy into a permanent victory sign. With laughter and compassion, Ensler transports her audiences to a world we've never dared to know, guaranteeing that no one who reads The Vagina Monologues will ever look at a woman's body the same way again.</p><p>"I say vagina because I want people to respond," says playwright Eve Ensler, creator of the hilarious, disturbing soliloquies in <i>The Vagina Monologues</i>, a book based on her one-woman play. And respond they do--with horror, anger, censure, and sparks of wonder and pleasure. Ensler is on a fervent mission to elevate and celebrate this much mumbled-about body part. She asked hundreds of women of all ages a series of questions about their vaginas (What do you call it? How would you dress it?) that prompt some wondrous answers. Standouts among the euphemisms are tamale, split knish, choochi snorcher, Gladys Siegelman-- <i>Gladys Siegelman?</i>--and, of course, that old standby "down there." "Down there?" asks a composite character springing from several older women. "I haven't been down there since 1953. No, it had nothing to do with [American president] Eisenhower." Two of the most powerful pieces include a jagged poem stitched together from the memories of a Bosnian woman raped by soldiers and an American woman sexually abused as a child who reclaims her vagina as a place of wild joy.A poignant and hilarious tour of the last frontier, the ultimate forbidden zone, <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> is a celebration of female sexuality in all its complexity and mystery.

"They speak so strangely," he whispers to his father. His father, a translator and scribe who works in the caliph's library, the House of Wisdom, replies sagely, "You may not understand them, but that does not mean they have nothing to say."<p> Mother-and-daughter team Florence Parry Heide and Judith Heide Gilliland weave a beautiful, timeless, and true-life tale, recounting how the House of Wisdom in Baghdad (the then capital of the Islamic Empire) gathered and preserved manuscripts from all around the known world--at a time when Europe languished in the Dark Ages. Ishaq grows up in this vast library with his father, knowing how prized these ancient books are (the caliph gives his father a manuscript's weight in gold for translating it!) but not fully grasping the importance of the legacy they represent.

Florence Parry Heide lives in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Judith Hede Gilliland lives in Amherst, New Hampshire. <p>Mary GrandPr� has always been interested in faraway places and ancient times. For Mary, the experience of traveling to Nepal, Bangkok, and Hong Kong, on a trip several years ago opened up a whole new appreciation of the color, pattern, design, and the richness of architecture from these cultures. This inspired her to take on the challenge of illustrating The House of Wisdom. Trying to be both historically authentic and creative was a challenge for her, as she re-created the Arabic mosaic patterns and the elaborate mosques in her own unique style. From this project she came away with a new appreciation of the perfect geometry and painstakingly beautiful design. The human, emotional element kept her grounded during the process of creating the illustrations for The House of Wisdom. In her own words she explained that "I think we all hope to be like Ishaq in some way-leaving a piece of ourselves for others to learn from." Mary GrandPr�'s award-winning picture books include Chin Yu Min and the Ginger Cats and Pockets by Jennifer Armstrong, Batwings and the Curtain of Night by Marguerite Davol, and most recently the Harry Potter series by J.K.

It is the draft of a lost metapsychological paper, one of twelve essays written during World War I at the peak of the master's powers. Freud intended to publish all twelve in book form, under the title <i>Preliminaries to a Metapsychology</i>, and thereby set out the theoretical foundations of psychoanalysis. Scholars have long lamented the disappearance without a trace of seven of these important essays. </p><p> Only in 1983 did Ilse Grubrich-Simitis happen upon this draft, in Freud's handwriting, in an old trunk containing papers and documents of his Hungarian collaborator S�ndor Ferenczi. With the help of a brief letter Freud had written on the back of the last page, she soon realized that the manuscript she had found was the draft of the final paper in the series. That draft is published here in facsimile, together with a transcription in German of the facsimile and the English translation. </p><p> In the first part of the draft, which is written in a kind of shorthand, Freud contrasts the three classic transference neuroses: anxiety hysteria, conversion hysteria, and obsessional neurosis. In the second part, which is written in complete sentences, Freud undertakes a daringly speculative "phylogenetic fantasy" He explores whether the debilitating illnesses of the neurotic and the psychotic today might have originated long ago as adaptive responses of the entire species to threatening environmental changes or to traumatic events in the prehistory of mankind. </p><p> In the draft "Fantasy" Freud modifies and expands the line of reasoning he began in <i>Totem and Taboo</i> (1912-13) after an intensely productive exchange with Ferenczi about Lamarckian concepts, making this recovered draft of major significance to students not only of psychoanalysis but also of the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences. </p><p> Ilse Grubrich-Simitis has contributed a detailed essay, setting the overview in the context of Freud's life, his work, and his historical and scientific prominence. She quotes from relevant letters of Freud and Ferenczi, some published here for the first time. </p></p><p>A practicing and teaching psychoanalyst, <b>Ilse Grubrich-Simitis</b> is the editor responsible for all Freud editions at S.

"Knee Deep in Grace" presents the life story of Dipa Ma Barua, along with the essential spiritual teachings that make her a towering figure in contemporary Buddhism. While she experienced fame in her lifetime and had a following of many Burmese, Indian, and American students, she was like the women saints of the Vedas, "remarkable women...from the dawn of history...who achieved realization while cleaning their homes and raising their children" ("Daughters of the Goddess, Women Saints of India"). Dipa Ma was remarkable in her ordinariness, astounding in her natural grounding in the reality of the present moment. <p>Dipa Ma was a primary teacher of Sharon Salzberg, Jack Kornfield, and Joseph Goldstein, who have been among the most influential "importers" of Buddhism to America. Through the centers they founded and the teachers trained in them (the author among them), the example and teaching of Dipa Ma reach multitudes. Jack Kornfield described the power of Ma's influence: "Without anything said or done, just the impact of meeting a person so developed can be enough to change one's whole way of life." </p><p>"Knee Deep in Grace" is filled with intimate stories collected over a period of ten years, not only from prominent meditation teachers in the West but from Dipa Ma's daughter and grandson and her Calcutta students. Dipa Ma addressed her teaching to ordinary people in her apartment complex and her extended family, and her iconoclastic style of daily life "immersion" practice brought many of her students to awakening. And as this book testifies, her old students as well as new ones find that Dipa Ma continues to guide and inspire their meditation practice.</p></p><p>Amy Schmidt is a resident teacher at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, MA.

As a genre, it brims with possibility. Often dismissed as a frivolous style of entertainment, the musical can actually be the most powerful and affecting of theatrical forms.'<br><br>So begins Paul Harvard's impassioned and invaluable guide for actors and students of musical theatre. But he quickly diagnoses a problem with much of the acting he sees in drama schools, where he teaches, and on the professional stage, where he has worked. Self-consciousness creeps in, singing and dancing take precedence, so that when performers open their mouths to sing, the acting stops.<br><br>Acting Through Song directly addresses this challenge. Harvard takes the techniques of modern actor training including the theories of Stanislavsky, Brecht, Meisner and Laban, amongst others and applies them to the fundamental component of musical theatre: singing.<br><br>With dozens of exercises to put these theories into practice, and numerous examples from a broad range of musicals, the result is a comprehensive and rigorous acting course for those training in musical theatre or already performing, whether amateur or professional, to realise their potential and act better.</p><p>The most methodical, thorough and practical book on the subject that I've ever read. --Daniel Evans<br><br>If you want to maximise your potential in our tough profession, this is not just a must-read, it's your bible. --Stuart Barr.

Little kids love counting books, too. And little kids also love manipulatives- tactile objects disguised as educational tools that are pleasing to the touch and a joy to play with. Now add them together, and the result is the all-but irresistible 10 Button Book.<p> Created by celebrated folk artist William Accorsi, 10 Button Book is the gutsiest, most interactive of counting books. Ingeniously designed, it combines a double-thick board book with ten colorful, government safety-tested plastic buttons attached by ten strong colorful ribbons, all bound into the spine. The object is simple. On spread one - One button Billy kids take one of the buttons and snap it into the die-cut holes, in this case filling out the "eyes" of a character's face. And so on, up to Ten buttons on his nose, where kids fill in the inverted pyramid of buttons over a juggler's head. The rhyming text is simple and energetic; the illustrations are dynamic collages made of cut felt. Little kids learning to count (and those who already know their one-to-tens) will be popping the buttons in and out, again and again. And undoubtedly there to help in the fun will be the kids who are their parents.</p><p></p></p><p>Do You Know Your One-to-Ten?<p> Snap in the Buttons and Count Again!</p><p> From one button Billy's belly to the ten buttons balanced on the juggler's nose, this really really big diecut board book comes chock-full of beribboned buttons, buttonholes, and silly rhymes.</p><p></p><p></p>William Accorsi is the author of <i>10 Button Book</i> and <i>10 Color Book</i>.

The Honored Matres -a violent offshoot of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood-have destroyed Arrakis, of Dune, searing all life from the desert planet. Sweeping across the galaxy, they relentlessly hunt down and destroy every Bene Gesserit stronghold they can find, always searching for Chapterhoursem the most powerful of all Bene Gesserit worlds. Meanwhile, the Sisterhood, led by Mother Superior Odrade, slowly transforms the green planet into a scorching desert in order to grow melange, the psychotropic spice they need for their existance. Through billions of sisters have died on worlds the Honored Matres control, Odrade has a plan for the Bene Gesserit&#39;s ultimate survival. One weapon in her arsenal is the wormrider Sheeana, an Atreides descendant whom Odrade is secretly grooming as the sacred heart of a religious cult-and who may be the key to controlling the desert ecology of Chapterhouse. Another is the ghola-child or clone, of the military mastermind Miles Teg, who demonstrates the uncanny speed of the Honored Matres themselves. Most valuable of all may be the captive Honored Matre Murbella. During the Scattering of humanity through the galaxy, the dark sisterhood learned the secret of sexual addiction. Odrade has used the technique to bond Murbella to the ghola of Duncan Idaho, whose suspected Mentat abilities would make him another Kwizatz Haderach, as dangerously uncontrollable as Paul Muad&#39;Dib. But the Bene Gesserit are running out of time, for the enemy is drawing closer, and a supreme sacrifice must be made...</p><p></p><h2>Shadow Warrior: The CIA Hero of a Hundred Unknown Battles</h2><p>A dedicated anti-Communist and CIA operative describes his work for the Central Intelligence Agency, from the Bay of Pigs invasion, to his wartime service in Vietnam, to his roles in the capture of Che Guevara and the Iran-Contra operation</p><p>Cuban emigre Rodriguez was a participant in many of the key political events of the past three decades, ranging from the Bay of Pigs invasion to the Iran-Contra affair. His autobiography effectively captures the idealism and anti-Communist fervor of the early 1960s, and is marked by an obsession with Fidel Castro ("I considered myself at war with Fidel."). Much of this book is a series of descriptions of Rodriguez's intelligence operations in Latin America and Vietnam. He devotes two chapters to his search for Che Guevara in Bolivia, and he provides an unexpectedly moving account of Che's death. Students of American foreign policy will find many scintillating insights on these pages, and the book has an easy narrative flow which will appeal to general readers. Rodriguez's frequent superpatriotic flourishes may bother some readers, but this account is a useful addition to the literature of the Cold War.<br><i>- Thomas Karel, Franklin &amp; Marshall Coll. Lib., Lancaster, Pa.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.A CIA undercover agent in Cuba before the Bay of Pigs debacle, Cuban-born Rodriguez also ran a communications network in Nicaragua, took part in the capture of Che Guevara in Bolivia, led a strike force during the Vietnam war and, more recently, served as Oliver North's liaison to the Salvadorian government. He was roughly handled by a Senate subcommittee investigating ties between the contras and drug smuggling in Central America--its chairman, Senator John Kerry, later apologized to him publicly. Rodriguez's personal adventures, written with freelancer Weisman, make for exciting reading, but of broader historical interest are his comments on Che Guevara's final hours, the dissension within Miami's Cuban community and its various anti-Castro movements and his informed indictment of U.S. operational blunders in Central America.

The exhibit began when Michael Shulan taped a photograph of the towers in a vacant Soho shop window. A friend encouraged him to post more photos and on September 25 the gallery opened for a supposed three-week run. Months and thousands of pictures later, the project included a Web site and the publication of this book. Like the show itself, this book contains pages of uncaptioned photographs, almost 1000 of the more than 5000 photos submitted by some 3000 photographers. "Anybody and everybody" brought photos; those chosen for publication were selected "to give the most coherent sense of the whole." The book opens with approximately 170 black-and-white photos; the hundreds that follow are in color. The pictures vary in composition, in viewpoint, and both in camera angle and type of equipment used. Some are macabre, some eerie, some border on the tasteless, and a few are beautiful. The book concludes with the most breathtaking and evocative piece in the entire collection-a two-page color photo of the upper reaches of the Twin Towers thrusting upward through a sea of clouds.<br><i>Dori DeSpain, Fairfax County Public Library, VA</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.On September 25, 2001, an exhibition opened in a previously vacant storefront in SoHo, perhaps 20 blocks from Ground Zero. Photographer Peress, who had been photographing the city for the New Yorker, Michael Shulan (who owned the building where the exhibit started) and two friends decided to hang pictures of the city by anybody and everybody who submitted them. The exhibition attracted thousands of submissions, and many thousands more visitors, and has toured in the U.S. and Europe, including stops at New York's Museum of Modern Art and Washington, D.C.'s Corcoran Gallery. The slip-cased, 12" 8 1/4" book presents 720 color and 160 duotone (and mostly full-page) portraits of the city in crisis, with crisp printing and no captions. While many of the images may resemble those seen repeatedly over the past year, this assemblage feels direct without being voyeuristic. If it is heavy on the flags, it is because the city was festooned at the time, and the pictures convey an array of different responses, personal and political, to the tragedy. This book really does, in Whitman's words, contain multitudes.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Get Motivated!: Overcome Any Obstacle, Achieve Any Goal, and Accelerate Your Success with Motivational DNA</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i> and <i>Wall Street Journal</i> Bestseller</b><br><br>Motivated people advance further and faster in their careers, earn more money, are more productive, experience more satisfying relationships and are happier than the less- motivated people around them.

Rogers, M.D. It contains the ultimate healing plan that people have successfully used to beat cancer when they were given 2 weeks, some even 2 days to live by some of the top medical centers. These people have exhausted all that medicine has to offer, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and bone marrow transplants. Some had even been macrobiotic failures. And one of the most unbelievable things is that the plan cost practically nothing to implement and most of it can be done at home with non-prescription items. Of course, in keeping with the other works and going far beyond, this contains the mechanisms of how these principles heal and is complete with the scientific references for physicians. Did you know, for example, that there are vitamins that actually cure some cancers, and over 50 papers in the best medical journals to prove it? Likewise, did you know that there are non-prescription enzymes that dissolve cancer, arteriosclerotic plaque, and auto-antibodies like lupus and rheumatoid? Did you know that there is a simple inexpensive, but highly effective way to detoxify the body at home to stop the toxic side effects of chemotherapy within minutes? Did you know that this procedure can also reduce chemical sensitivity reactions (from accidental chemical exposures) from 4 days to 20 minutes? Did you know that there are many hidden causes for &#34;undiagnosable&#34; symptoms that are never looked for, because it is easier and quicker to prescribe a pill than find (and fix) the cause?</p><p></p><h2>The Rarest Blue: The Remarkable Story of an Ancient Color Lost to History and Rediscovered</h2><p><p></p><p>For centuries, blue and purple dyed fabrics ranked among the ancient world&#x2019;s most desirable objects, commanding many times their weight in gold. Few people knew their secrets, carefully&nbsp;guarding the valuable knowledge, and strict laws regulated their production and use. <i>The Rarest Blue</i> tells the incredible story of <i>tekhelet</i>, the elusive sky-blue color mentioned throughout the Bible. Minoans discovered it; Phoenicians stole it; Roman emperors revered it; and Jews&#x2014;obeying a commandment to affix a thread of it to their garments&#x2014;risked their lives for it. But as the Roman Empire dissolved, the color vanished. Then, in the nineteenth century, a marine biologist marveled as yellow snail guts smeared on a fisherman&#x2019;s&nbsp;shirt turned blue. But what had caused this incredible transformation? Meanwhile, a Hasidic master obsessed with the ancient technique posited that the source of the dye was no snail but a squid. Bitter controversy divided European Jews until a brilliant rabbi proved one side wrong. But had an unscrupulous chemist deceived them? In this richly illustrated book, Baruch Sterman brilliantly recounts the amazing story of this sacred dye that changed the color of history.</p><p></p></p><p><i>"I have known about the biblical blue for years, but </i>The Rarest Blue<i>&nbsp;had a revelation for me on every page.

Popular historians would have us believe that a few heroic individuals, possessing superhuman talents, lead an unselfish quest to better the human condition. But as renowned Yale surgeon and medical historian Sherwin B. Nuland shows in this brilliant collection of linked life portraits, the theory bears little resemblance to the truth.<br><br>Through the centuries, the men and women Who have shaped the world of medicine have been not only very human people but also very much the products of their own times and places. Presenting compelling studies of great medical innovators and pioneers, Doctors gives us the extraordinary story of the development of modern medicine -- told through the lives of the physician-scientists whose deeds and determination paved the way. Ranging from the legendary Father of Medicine, Hippocrates, to Andreas Vesalius, whose Renaissance masterwork on anatomy offered invaluable new insight into the human body, to Helen Taussig, founder of pediatric cardiology and co-inventor of the original "blue baby" operation, here is a volume filled with the spirit of ideas and the thrill of discovery. Says The New York Times, "Doctors can be warmly recommended. Dr. Nuland succeeds in bringing his subjects vividly to life, and he leaves you with a much better understanding of what they achieved."<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Sherwin B. Nuland, M.D., was&nbsp;a clinical professor of surgery at Yale University and&nbsp;the author of numerous books, including&nbsp;<i>How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter</i>, which won the National Book Award, <i>Lost in America: A Journey with My Father,</i>&nbsp;<i>Maimonides,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Leonardo da Vinci</i>. In addition to his numerous articles for medical publications, he wrote for <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The New Republic</i>, <i>Time</i>, and <i>The New York Review of Books</i>. Dr. Nuland died in 2014.To tell the story of medicine since Hippocrates and Galen, Nuland, a surgeon and faculty member of the Yale School of Medicine, focuses on the personalities and careers of medical innovators since the 16th century who epitomized the scientific climate and culture of their period. His enthusiastic and anecdote-rich narrative ranges from Vesalius, whose magnificently illustrated text on anatomy reflected the Renaissance rediscovery of the human body, to Barnard's high-tech heart transplants and other organ-replacement surgery of today. Medical landmarks include Harvey's charting of the circulatory system, Laennec's invention of the diagnostic stethoscope, and the discovery of germs and antisepsis by Pasteur and Lister. Nuland also notes contributions by Americans (Halsted and Cushing among them), as well as advances in transfusions, anesthesia, medical training and surgery. Having documented the transition of doctors from personal healers to reductionist technicians concerned primarily with disease, he welcomes efforts by today's physicians to return to a more humanistic approach. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Flying Close to the Sun: My Life and Times as a Weatherman</h2><p>Flying Close to the Sun is the stunning memoir of a white middle-class girl from Connecticut who became a member of the Weather Underground, one of the most notorious groups of the 1960s. Cathy Wilkerson, who famously escaped the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, here wrestles with the<br>legacy of the movement, at times finding contradictions that many others have avoided: the absence of women&#x2019;s voices then, and in the retelling; the incompetence and the egos; the hundreds of bombs detonated in protest which caused little loss of life but which were also ineffective in fomenting revolution. In searching for new paradigms for change, Wilkerson asserts with brave humanity and confessional honesty an assessment of her past&#x2014;of those heady, iconic times&#x2014;and somehow finds hope and faith in a world that at times seems to offer neither.</p><p>CATHY WILKERSON was active in the civil rights movement, Students for a Democratic Society, and the Weathermen.

Brennan (The Food and Flavors of Haute Provence) divides the recipes into appetizers, entr es, vegetables and desserts, and each dish is derived from a specific region: Pissaladi re from Provence, Gratin ed Mussels on the Half Shell from Languedoc and Fondue from Franche-Comt and the Alps. Meat entr es tend to be grilled (Grilled Lamb chops with Fresh Thyme, Grilled Eel) or roasted (Duck with Lavender Honey, Roasted Veal with Whole Garlic). Some of the most appealing fare can be found in the chapter on vegetable dishes, many of which, such as Saut ed Asparagus and Artichokes with Black Olives and Parmesan and Stuffed Turnips filled with sausage, hazelnuts and currants, could be served as main courses. Desserts, such as Cherry Custard Cake, are generally fruit-based. The glossary is admirably thorough, the photography is lovely throughout and Brennan's sidebars (on topics such as foraging for mushrooms) are certainly competent, but the large format and full-color presentation may make this a cookbook destined for the coffee table rather than the kitchen counter.

After Hoover&#39;s death, Mark Felt found himself in the cross fire of one of Washington&#39;s historic contests, as Nixon and his men tried to dominate the Bureau and cover up the crimes of the administration. This book illuminates the ongoing clash between temporary political power and the permanent bureaucracy of government. Woodward explores Felt&#39;s conflicts and motives as he became Deep Throat, not only secretly confirming Woodward and Bernstein&#39;s findings from dozens of other sources, but giving a sense of the staggering sweep of Nixon&#39;s criminal abuses.In this volume, part memoir, part morality tale, part political and journalistic history, Woodward provides context and detail about The Washington Post&#39;s expose of Watergate. He examines his later, tense relationship with Felt, when the FBI man stood charged with authorizing FBI burglaries. (Not knowing Felt&#39;s secret role in the demise of his own presidency, Nixon testified at Felt&#39;s trial, and Ronald Reagan later pardoned him.) Woodward lays bare his own personal struggles as he tries to define his relationship, his obligations, and his gratitude to this extraordinary confidential source.The Secret Man is an intense, 33-year journey, providing a one-of-a-kind study of trust, deception, pressures, alliances, doubts and a lifetime of secrets. Woodward has spent more than three decades asking himself why Mark Felt became Deep Throat. Now the world can see what happened and why, bringing to a close one of the last chapters of Watergate.</p><p>Bob Woodward's secret man is no longer a secret, now that former FBI assistant director W. Mark Felt and his family have revealed that he was Deep Throat, Woodward's legendary anonymous source for his Watergate reporting. Soon after Felt made his identity known, Woodward, who "is prone to complete his homework before it is due or even assigned," according to the afterword by his reporting partner Carl Bernstein, himself revealed that he had been working on a manuscript in preparation for that moment, one that would after 30 years tell the inside story of their mysterious, and history-changing, relationship.<p> Certainly you get in <i>The Secret Man</i> the cloak-and-dagger details you'd expect--and are likely already familiar with from both the book and the superb movie of <i>All the President's Men</i>: the late-night garage meetings, the red flag in the flower pot, the whispered warning that lives were in danger. Woodward retells the still-riveting story of his and Bernstein's unearthing of the scandal with efficiency and with the last puzzle piece in place. And he is able both to explain some of Felt's motivations, as an FBI loyalist disgusted by Nixon staffers trying to run roughshod over his agency, and to trace some of his remarkable bureaucratic tactics, including commissioning an FBI leak inquiry and deflecting it away from himself. Most fascinatingly, he gives a warts-and-all account of his shameless youthful cultivation of Felt, beginning with their first encounter when Woodward was a bored Navy lieutenant on the make, just three years before being assigned to cover the arraignment of five men in business suits arrested in the offices of the Democratic National Committee. But in a crucial way this doesn't seem to be the book that Woodward had wanted to write, for Felt remains a mystery. A shadowy father figure during the Watergate period, Felt soon distanced himself from Woodward after running into legal trouble of his own, and they fell out of touch in the intervening years. When Woodward finally reestablished contact in 2000, Felt had lost most of his memory, and any understanding with his former source, with whom he was so closely tied in both his private and public lives, remained poignantly but frustratingly unreachable. <i>--Tom Nissley</i></p>Bob Woodward has been a reporter and editor at The Washington Post since 1971.</p><h2>The End of the Certain World: The Life and Science of Max Born</h2><p>In 1920, Albert Einstein wrote to Max Born, Theoretical physics will flourish wherever you happen to be; there is no other Born to be found in Germany today.&#x201d; <i>The End of the Certain World</i> presents for the first time Born's full story: Nobel physicist, a discoverer of quantum theory, exile from Hitler's Germany, teacher of nine Nobel physicists. Born's role in the Golden Age of Physics&#x201d; helped to shape the science of the twentieth century and open the door to the modern era. Robert Oppenheimer, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner, among others, flocked to G�ttingen, Germany in the 1920's to work with Born, the physicist who had discovered one of the most profound principles of the century - the physics of indeterminacy. In a cruel twist of fate Born, a pacifist who loved science for its beauty, had educated these renowned scientists who developed the atom bomb. Not everyone embraced Born's revolutionary quantum principle. Throughout much of his forty year friendship with Einstein, the two debated the nature of the universe - deterministic versus non-deterministic - with Einstein declaring God does not play dice&#x201d;, even though the Nobel Committee supported Born's position when they awarded him the 1954 Prize. A social history and a history of science as well as an intimate biography, <i>The End of the Certain World</i> reveals the story of a great physicist and humanitarian and his struggle with the forces of religion, politics, and war during the upheavals of the twentieth century.</p><p>&#x201c; The world is not ruled by reason; even less by love,&#x201d; Max Born wrote to his close friend Albert Einstein in 1921. Twelve years later, as the Nazis forced him to emigrate to Great Britain, he felt the personal impact of that statement. Even after the defeat of the Nazis, the explosion of the atom bomb inflicted a further blow. It was a cruel twist of fate that Born, a pacifist who loved science for its beauty, had educated the developers of the atom bomb. Robert Oppenheimer, Edward Teller, Eugene Wigner and John von Neumann, among others, had flocked to G�ttingen, Germany, to work with Born, the physicist who had discovered one of the most profound principles of the century &#x2013; the physics of indeterminacy. <p><i>The End of the Certain World</i> presents for the first time Born&#x2019;s full story: Nobel physicist, a discoverer of quantum theory, exile from Hitler&#x2019;s Germany, teacher of nine Nobel physicists. Born&#x2019;s role in the &#x201c;Golden Age of Physics&#x201d; in the 1920s helped to shape the science of the twentieth century and open the door to the modern era. Together with his <i>Wunderkinder</i> &#x2013; including his assistant Werner Heisenberg &#x2013; Born solved the Quantum puzzle. But whereas Heisenberg received his Nobel Prize in 1933, Born was overlooked; he had to wait more than twenty years to receive one.</p> <p>When Born finally did win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954, it was awarded for his theory of the indeterminate nature of the atomic world. It was a validation on more than one level. He had a long&nbsp; standing debate with Einstein on the subject, and Born&#x2019;s position &#x2013; that God <i>does</i> play dice &#x2013; had been recognized; we indeed live in a world of uncertainty.</p> <p><i>The End of the Certain World</i> is a social history and a history of science as well as an intimate biography. Nancy Thorndike Greenspan unfolds the story of a great physicist and humanitarian, to reveal his struggle with the forces of religion, politics, and war.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>"This is an insightful, moving, and beautifully written portrait of Max Born, a deeply sensitive man who in his long life experienced familial happiness and discord, professional success and injustice, political tranquility and upheaval, and through it all made his mark as one of the leading theoretical physicists of the twentieth century." -Roger H. Stuewer, emeritus professor of physics, University of Minnesota <p> "I am so proud of my grandfather. Nancy Greenspan has written an incredible book! I learned how much my grandfather influenced the science and history of the twentieth century-from saving his fellow scientists from Hitler to debating Einstein on the uncertainty in the structure of the universe.

To myself, personally, it brings nothing but increasing drudgery and daily loss of friends.&#34; An American president must ultimately take responsibility for the direction of the country, an ideal succinctly expressed by Harry S. Truman, who told his fellow citizens that &#34;the buck stops here.&#34; Embracing that sense of responsibility may have been easier for some presidents--Calvin Coolidge and William Jefferson Clinton, for instance, both held the office during economic booms--than for others, who served during more trying times. But even presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt, who occupied the White House at a time of war, nonetheless resolutely took up the gauntlet of protecting and improving the social and economic welfare of the American people. Of course, hard times test the mettle of every president, however golden the age in which he serves, because the problems of the country--and the world--are often left at the president&#39;s feet. And though he can rely on the counsel of his Cabinet as well as the Congress and Senate, the burden of making each decision, not to mention accepting the consequences, rests squarely on his shoulders alone. As John F. Kennedy remarked, &#34;No easy problem ever comes to the President of the United States. If they are easy to solve, somebody elsehas solved them.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Great Swindle</h2><p>The year is 1918, the war on the Western Front all but over. An ambitious officer, Lieutenant Henry D'Aulnay-Pradelle, sends two soldiers over the top and then surreptitiously shoots them in the back to incite his men to attack the German lines. <br> When another of D'Aulnay-Pradelle's soldiers, Albert Maillard, reaches the bodies and discovers how they died, the lieutenant shoves him into a shell hole to silence him. Albert is rescued by fellow soldier, the artist Edouard P�ricourt, who takes a bullet in the face. The war ends and both men recover, but Edouard is permanently disfigured, and fakes his death to prevent his family from seeing him as a cripple. In gratitude for Edouard's rescue, Albert becomes the injured man's companion and caregiver. <br> Finding that the postwar gratitude for the soldiers' service is nothing more than lip-service to an empty idea, the two men scramble to survive, ultimately devising a scam to take money for never-to-be-built war memorials from small towns. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Pradelle has married Edouard's sister Madeline and is running a scam of his own that involves the exhumation of war victims. <br> In this sorrowful, heart-searching novel, the interwoven lives of these three men create a tapestry of the human condition as seen through the lens of war, revealing brutality and compassion, heroism and cowardice, in equal measure.</p><p><b>Pierre Lemaitre </b>was born in Paris in 1956.

Cooper: The Real McCoy</h2><p>Looks at the investigation into the two airplane hijackings in which Richard McCoy, also known as D.B. Cooper, parachuted from the planes with the ransom money</p><p>The hijacking of a Northwest Orient Airlines flight in 1971 by one Dan (D. B.) Cooper, who parachuted from the plane and escaped with $200,000, is the only unsolved crime of its kind in U.S. history. The following year a United Airlines flight was hijacked by a man who parachuted from the aircraft with $500,000. Identified as Richard McCoy, a Mormon Sunday School teacher and criminal justice student at Brigham Young University, the hijacker was convicted and sentenced to 45 years, but he escaped and was killed in a shoot-out with law enforcement officials in 1974. Both Rhodes and Calame were federal agents in Utah who worked on the McCoy case and believe that Cooper and McCoy were one and the same, a contention buttressed by the criminals' identical MOs and physical evidence. The argument is convincing, the book dramatic.

Edmund Wilson, for example, memorably labeled him "a vain and pushing diarist." Boswell can even be seen as someone unconsciously intent on undermining his idol in sonorous, balanced sentences. Early on in his massive <i>Life</i>, he puts all manner of ideas into our heads with his boobish attempts to clear the youthful Johnson of potential impropriety: "His juvenile attachments to the fair sex were, however, very transient; and it is certain that he formed no criminal connection whatsoever." And while it's often tempting to ignore Boswell's more personal intrusions and delight solely in the melancholic master's words and deeds, there are suchdelightful admissions as, "I was at this time so occupied, shall I call it? or so dissipated, by the amusements of London that our next meeting was not till Saturday, June 25..." <p> Samuel Johnson was born in 1709 and died in 1784--a long life, though one marred by depression and fear of death. On April 20, 1764, for example, he declared, "I would consent to have a limb amputated to recover my spirits." Many of the quotes Boswell includes are a sort of greatest hits: Johnson's definitions of oats and lexicographer, his love for his cat Hodge, as well as thousands of bon, and mal, mots. ("Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel"; "Sir, a woman's preaching is like a dog's walking on his hinder legs. It is not done well; but you are surprized to find it done at all.") But there are also many unfamiliar pleasures--Boswell's accounts of Johnson's literary industry, including the <i>Dictionary,</i> <i>The Rambler</i>, and <i>Lives of the Poets</i>; Johnson's singular loathing for Scotland and France; and the surprising hints of revelry. Awakened at 3 AM by friends, he greets them with, "What, is it you, you dogs! I'll have a frisk with you." This at age 42. Johnson's final years were marked by pain and loneliness but certainly no loss of wit.</p><br>"I don't need to tell you what a splendid service Oxford performs by having the complete <em>Life</em> available inexpensively and with Chapman's deft annotations and Rogers's smart and useful introduction."--Alexander Poffit, <em>University of North Texas</em><p></p><br>"...An elegant study of currents and of undercurrents in the travellers' separate accounts of their journey to the Western Islands.

From this vantage point, Anne Willan -- long known as an authority on French regional cuisine, on food history, and on classic French cooking -- has written a personal book, elegantly interweaving chapters on her life in the chateau with journeys out into the surrounding landscape. She examines the work of the people of Chateau du Fey and its surrounding quarters: the gardeners, farmers, vintners, and restaurateurs who live and breathe French cuisine, and who contribute to the character and flavors of the Burgundian table.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Foremost in the cast of characters in <b>Anne Willan From My Chateau Kitchen</b> is M. Milbert, gardien and gardener, who will pick no vegetable before its time. But there is also Claude the water man, who looks after pipes and plumbing for both village and chateau, and who figures prominently in the group of local hunters who follow the age-old rules of la chasse. We are introduced to M. Simon, the blacksmith with a network of cellars under a nearby cathedral, where he makes ratafia. And M. Haumonte teaches traditional bread and croissant making using the chateau's wood-fired oven. There is the lady from Morvan who makes 500 varieties of jam, the beekeeper, and the father and son with the traveling cider press. Anne Willan takes us through the countryside, to markets in Sens, to the makers of mustard and spice bread in Dijon, to Villeneuve-sur-Yonne, where Leslie Caron presides over an establishment serving Burgundian fare, and to Joigny, where Lorain father and son reign in 3-star splendor.<br><br>Anne has chosen to share recipes for the dishes she cooks and eats at home, including such classics as Leek Quiche, Oeufs en Meurette, and Jambon Chablisien. There are also recipes that cope with the garden's staggering bounty, such as Spiced Red Currant Jelly and Gratin of Summer Vegetables in Herb Pesto. Other recipes are brought by the chefs who cook at the La Varenne school -- including Snail and Mushroom Ravioli with Parsley Sauce and Dried Fig and Marc Ice Cream.<br><br>In almost 300 color photographs and with more than 160 recipes, Anne Willan renders an intimate appreciation of both the food and the culture of Burgundy. As this beautiful and personal book proves, Anne Willan has succeeded marvelously in her chosen (and enviable) task of exploring, understanding, and teaching the art of French cuisine as it manifests itself in one of France's most food-oriented provinces. Which just happens to be her back -- and front -- yard.</p><p><i>From My Ch�teau Kitchen</i> revolves around three subjects: the author's life in the 17th-century Burgundian ch�teau she and her husband own; the work of the farmers, vintners, restaurateurs, and others who live in the area and define its spirit; and Burgundian food, the glorious regional <i>plats</i> that represent a time-honored yet ever-evolving cuisine. Anne Willan, founder and president of La Varenne cooking school (now headquartered at the ch�teau), skillfully weaves these strands into a romantic but down-to-earth memoir. With more than 300 color photos and 160 adroitly selected recipes, the book offers both armchair excitement and practical kitchen direction. Those drawn to French regional cooking and the life that anchors it will embrace the book. <p> In chapters such as "The Adventure Begins," "On Burgundian Tables," and "The Wider Scene," Willan comes, sees, and is conquered--repeatedly. Best of all are her shrewdly drawn human portraits. We meet, among others, the ch�teau gardener who picks vegetables only at maximum size, a blacksmith who guards his homemade ratafia in a cathedral cellar, and a father-son pair who operate a traveling cider press. Willan's recipes--all meticulously written--accompany the discussions. Traditional Beef Bourguignon (a definitive formula), Warm Wild Mushroom Mousse, Madame Milbert's Rabbit Terrine, and Apple G�teau Le Fey are just some of the dishes that illustrate a time, place, or person. Closing with a chapter that presents the ch�teau wedding of Willan's daughter (and includes the wedding cake recipe), the book comes full circle; it returns readers to a beginning and reminds them that food, which is the life of the Burgundian land, is without break, beginning or end. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Anne Willan blends the romantic and the level-headed in a unique way. She appreciates the sensuous delights of life as only a reformed puritan can. She tells the story of her love affair with France and French food in terms of real people and places: the cooking classes in Paris, the run-down chateau, the growing friendships with local farmers and shopkeepers, the cheese-makers and truffle-hunters, the fascinating neighbors -- all this is a showcase in which Anne sets out her favorite recipes. This is food in context, and a context to make Francophiles everywhere rejoice.<br>-- Hugh Johnson<br><br>In this tender and thrilling book, Anne Willan invites us to share her love affair with Chateau du Fey and Burgundy. Between the delicious recipes she offers an insight into a region with a rich past and long-rooted traditions. The affectionate eye she casts on the local characters and their stories provides an intimate portrait of the not-quite-vanished world of rural France.<br>-- Claudia Roden</p><h2>Can You See What I See?

And just when mouths are watering, the family sits down, holds hands, and says a prayer of thanks to God for &#39;food and fun and family, all the wonderful things we see.&#39; Young readers will delight in each tender rhyme as they learn to appreciate their own many blessings in this full-color picture book for kids.

In her double-page spread illustrations, Bates creates a winning personality for the narrator of the story, an unnamed little boy with a big smile. He greets his arriving relatives, plays outside in the leaves with his cousins and enjoys a traditional turkey dinner with pumpkin pie. The boy is followed everywhere by his friendly golden retriever, whose coloring blends in with the fall palette, and Bates adds comical touches such as a close-up view of the child during the dinner with black olives stuck on each finger....The religious aspect of the text includes a prayer before dinner and a repeated refrain, based on a phrase from a Psalm, expressing thanks to God. Adults who prefer a Christian focus for a Thanksgiving story will find this volume useful.' -- Kirkus Reviews <br><br> (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>Noted picture-book scribe Wilson again teams with Bates---the pair also created I Will Rejoice: Celebrating Psalm 118---for a follow-up project that spotlights a biblical psalm. This time around, Wilson ties in references to the titular refrain from Psalm 92 with an account of a family's Thanksgiving Day celebration. In rhyming text, a child recounts all the sounds, sights and smells of the November holiday, citing the joys of family, food and fun. Playing in piles of leaves, warming up with apple cider and settling on the couch post-feast with a full belly are among the experiences for which the child expresses thanks to God. Bates's wispy lined pencil-and-watercolor illustrations exude a warmth that is sure to be especially welcome on chilly autumn days, and a joyful spirit appreciated any time of year. Ages 4-8. -- Publishers Weekly <br><br> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>'In rhyming stanzas, this cheerful picture book, told from a young boy's perspective, celebrates family, faith, and the idea that there's much to be thankful for. From the family members and friends who visit to playing in fall leaves to enjoying pumpkin pie, a boy relates and appreciates every aspect of his Thanksgiving Day experience. At last it's time for goodbyes, a good-night kiss, and prayers: 'It is good, so good to give thanks to the LORD.' The verse is sweet and earnest, describing lively moments as well as serene ones, such as saying mealtime grace, and the expressive watercolor-and-pencil artwork is done in a warm, bright palette. Psalm 92 inspires the book, and the familiar words are referenced at the beginning and end, and also used as a refrain.

As we know now, the elder composer was to live for almost two decades more; Mozart, a single year. It was to be a year in which he wrote <i>The Magic Flute</i>, <i>La Clemenza di Tito</i>, and the Clarinet Concerto, as well as most of the Requiem; it was also a year of mounting disappointment in his career as part of the Viennese musical establishment, and a year of growing debt. Robbins Landon is keen to debunk the myths: Mozart was not poisoned ,but died of progressive kidney failure, and Salieri was innocent of his death, though not of promoting his own career at Mozart's expense. Landon defends Mozart's wife, Constanze, against the libels of biographers, though at times his portrait of comfortable bourgeois monogamy sounds like special pleading and overlaps with hints of conscientious bohemian racketiness. This is a wonderful portrait of a great artist and the city where he lived; in passing, Landon tells us everything we need to know about musical life, Masonry, and the truth about that pauper's grave. <i>--Roz Kaveney</i>" Amadeus , the play and film, popularized the many legends about Mozart's 'decline and fall.' In this factual account of the composer's last year, musicologist Landon gathers authentic contemporary documents to 'bring us nearer to Mozart and his wife, Constanze, than does fiction, even at its most inspired,' " reported PW.

Boles frequently lectures at design centers, museums, and show houses around the country.<br>Foreword by Alexa Hampton<br><br>There is only one guaranteed way to become a master at any discipline: to be a master, you must master the material. As a perpetual student of design, I am always amazed by how much good design has been pioneered in the past and I love lingering on the work of<br>the greats and relearning the lessons visible in their practices. I love, equally, perusing the work of present-day designers, especially those whose mastery of their profession and of the subject is obvious. Perhaps the one thing that has worried me over the years is how to sort through the growing glut of images and information out there in this digital age, where everything is to be had and to be seen. How could anyone ever begin to cull and share all of the important images in the hope of showing their examples and exemplars? And how are we to capture and advocate for our historical trove of images, so that it doesn&#x2019;t drown in the swell of current work?<br><br>Well I, for one, thank the heavens above for <i>The Peak of Chic</i>&#x2019;s Jennifer Boles. She is now my design historian and my design information curator. With her editorial eye, love of the past, and incredible ability to extract knowledge from images full of cacophonous data&#x2014;and her transparent joy for her work&#x2014;Boles has become both the author and the guardian of the new interior design canon. In anyone&#x2019;s opinion, this is no small feat. And her accomplishments inspire many heartfelt responses. Sometimes my love for her eye is pure: she introduces me to designs I have never seen, that are pristine, and from which she concludes ideas that are profound. Sometimes my love for her eye is profane, when I vainly congratulate myself for having a shared love for an interior designer whose praises she is extolling. No matter which response she evokes, though, I am always engaged by what she has to say. <br><br>The most remarkable aspect of Boles's ability to assemble and analyze her garden of earthly delights is that as she does it she takes her reader much further into an experience than can be simply explained by displaying images and describing what they show. This book is a rare treasure. On every page Boles invites you to submerge yourself into the era in which these designs thrived, to observe and absorb the customs of the days of their creation. Her writing brings you into the world of her subjects and their milieu, as well draws attention to all of the details. As a result, she creates an almost tangible experience that triggers a sense memory&#x2014;if you&#x2019;ve never lived with chintz or upholstered doors, after reading <i>In with the Old</i>, at the very least you&#x2019;ll feel that perhaps you should.<br><br>Boles teaches us about design, but she also teaches us history, fashion, manners, and style. And, by example, Boles shows us how to love learning about design. Her passion for the topic and her vast store of exhaustive knowledge have made her an ultimate master of her domain. <br><br>&#x2014;Alexa Hampton, author of <i>Alexa Hampton: The Language of Interior Design </i>and <i>Decorating in Detail</i></p><h2>Golden Secrets of Mystic Oils: Over 300 Oils and 1000 Spells by Anna Riva</h2><p>An A-Z listing of over 550 Magical Oils with over 1300 Spells and ritual uses.</p><p></p><h2>Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter: A Novel</h2><p><p> In the 1970s, Larry Ott and Silas "32" Jones were boyhood pals in a small town in rural Mississippi.

How did you come up with the title? </p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> Title's a pneumonic device used to teach children (mostly southern children) how to spell Mississippi. M, I, crooked-letter, crooked-letter, I, crooked-letter, crooked-letter, I, humpback, humback, I.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <i>Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter</i> is a bit of a departure from your previous two novels&#x2014;<i>Smonk</i> and <i>Hell at the Breech</i>&#x2014;in that it is set in contemporary times and the story line is a bit less dark. What inspired the premise for this novel and the departure from a more historical setting? </p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> I'd been wanting to write about a small town police officer, and I'd long had the image of a loner mechanic in my mind. When I put the two together, the story began to form. I used a lot of autobiographical stuff for Larry, the mechanic. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> A review in <i>USA Today</i> (for <i>Hell at the Breech</i>) stated that, &#x201c;he also makes his characters rise up from the pages as if they were there with you.&#x201d; ...and this is certainly true in your latest novel. How do you approach the task of developing your characters and bringing them to life? Are the characters in <i>Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter</i> based on anyone in particular?</p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> They're both a combination of different facets of different people, a conglomeration of fact and fiction. I usually try to just let them begin to do what they want to do, just put them in a situation and see what they do. When they begin to surprise me, do things I hadn't anticipated, that's when it's working.<br><br> But the character of Silas "32" Jones is very loosely based on the sole police officer of the hamlet of Dickinson, Alabama, where I grew up. This guy was actually the law in a nearby mill town, and my hamlet of Dickinson fell in his tiny jurisdiction. I've always loved the idea of small town cops, especially one who might be a kind of underdog to the police forces of nearby larger towns.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> In <i>Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter</i> your two main characters are anything but stereotypical&#x2014;the young black boy goes off to college to play baseball and comes back to be the town constable and the young white boy is the accused murderer and the town outcast. What, if anything, prompted you to portray these characters this way? </p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> No real person is a stereotype, and I try to make my characters as real as I can. We're all a mess of contradictions and secrets, strangenesses and desires, and nobody's all good or all bad. We're all somewhere in the spectrum between absolute good and absolute evil. So I just try to find a character who's fairly normal, and put him or her in a fix and see how he or she negotiates it to see, as Kurt Vonnegut says, what he or she is made of. In this case, the story as I came to understand it called for Larry to stay home and Silas to leave. If it had been the other way around, I'd still work to make the characters unstereotypical. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Without giving away too much of the story, what is one thing (emotion, thought) that readers can expect to walk away with after reading this book? </p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> It's a sad book, but it's full of hope. Hope is what I want a reader to leave with.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Historically the South has not always had a positive image in other parts of the country. How has your experience growing up and living in the rural South shaped your talent as a writer? And have you ever felt the need to justify or redeem the South&#x2019;s past in any of your works?</p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> I think growing up in the south made me the person I am, and the writer I am comes from that. So, yes, the south's made me the writer I am. It taught me to listen to the cadences and rhythms of speech, and to notice the landscape. It also has this defeated feel, a lingering of old sin, that makes it sweet in a rotting kind of way. Much of it is poor, much is rural, and that's an interesting combination, a deep well for stories.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Did you always know that you wanted to be a writer? Who are some writers, past and present, that you admire or have inspired you? </p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> I always knew I wanted to tell stories, one way or another. If I'd had a video camera in the mid 1970s I'm sure I'd be a filmmaker now. But I just had a portable typewriter, and so the stories I could tell were ones on paper.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You are one of the most celebrated writers in the field, and have been compared to the likes of Harper Lee, William Faulkner, and Elmore Leonard. What do you believe is the one thing that sets you apart from other contemporary writers in your genre? </p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> What sets me apart? I honestly don't know that I&#x2019;m more "apart" from other writers of my generation. Landscape plays a large role in what I write, but that's true of many other writers. My stuff is set in the south, but that's true of others as well. I don't know, honestly.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> As a professor of English, what is one piece of advice that you would share with aspiring writers?</p> <p><strong>Franklin:</strong> Read, starting with the classics. Read all the time. If you don't read, you won't ever be a writer. Also, write. This seems obvious, but it's amazing how many "writers" don't write very much.</p><p></p><p>Tom Franklin's extraordinary talent has been hailed by the leading lights of contemporary literature&#x2014;Philip Roth, Richard Ford, Lee Smith, and Dennis Lehane. Reviewers have called his fiction "ingenious" (<em>USA Today</em>) and "compulsively readable" (<em>Memphis Commercial Appeal</em>). His narrative power and flair for character-ization have been compared to the likes of Harper Lee, Flannery O'Connor, Elmore Leonard, and Cormac McCarthy.</p><p>Now the Edgar Award-winning author returns with his most accomplished and resonant novel so far&#x2014;an atmospheric drama set in rural Mississippi.

Her days are filled with art and ballet. Then the Nazis march into Austria, and Lily's life is shattered overnight. Suddenly, her own country is no longer safe for her or her family. To survive, Lily leaves her parents behind and travels alone to England. <br><br>Escaping the Nazis is only the start of Lily's journey. She must escape many more times--from servitude, hardship, and danger. Will she find a way to have her own sort of revenge on the Nazis? Follow the story of a brave girl who becomes an artist of heroes and a true pioneer in comic books.</p><p>Writer and feminist herstorian Trina Robbins has been writing books, comics, and graphic novels for over 30 years. Her most recent books are <i>The Brinkley Girls</i> (Fantagraphics) and <i>Forbidden City: the Golden Age of Chinese Nightclubs </i>(Hampton Press). Her newest graphic novel is the three-part YA series <b>Chicagoland Detective Agency</b> for Graphic Universe(tm).<p>"When the Nazis march into Austria in 1938, Lily Renee's life changes forever. Although the Kindertransport allows Lily to escape the persecution she faces as a Jew living in Vienna, it means she must leave her parents and travel to England alone. As she embarks on this journey, she continues to face tremendous hardship and is repeatedly treated as an outsider. From being made a servant to taking a job as a nurse's assistant, Lily faces danger again and again until she is finally reunited with her parents in New York City. Inspired by everything she had to overcome, Lily grows up to illustrate comic books filled with powerful women, using her art to pursue her own kind of revenge against the Nazis. Effectively using a graphic novel format to tell a moving historical story, <em>Lily Renee, Escape Artist</em> puts a face to a brave teenager who survives tremendous tragedy to emerge a comic book pioneer. Although at times the simplistic narrative and colorful illustrations limit the poignancy of Lily's experience during a horrifying time in history, the positive message and historical detail make this graphic narrative a valuable resource that will appeal to young readers. Furthermore, the text also provides an extended appendix detailing some of the story&#x2019;s unique cultural and historic influences. <strong>A distinctive and useful visual portrayal of an inspirational true story, this graphic novel offers a great deal as an educational tool." </strong>--<em>VOYA</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Lily Ren�e Wilhelm was fourteen in 1938, a Jewish girl from a privileged Vienna home whose world was about to be turned upside down by the war.

With her father at the helm of the Holland America Steamship Company, money was clearly not an issue&#x2015;until the Nazis drove their tanks into town. After Kristallnacht, Lily's parents asked the family of Lily's pen pal, Molly, to sponsor their daughter to move to England. In 1939, Lily's escape from Austria on the Kindertransport likely saved her life. We know about the concentration camps, the death camps and the hardships of the Holocaust. Lily Renee, Escape Artist does not revisit these subjects. Instead, it shows us how Lily's life changed in England. Treated with disdain by her friend's mother, she was expected to do the work of a domestic servant and was denied sufficient food. Her misery was exacerbated by the fact that she could barely speak English at the time. She tried hard to find sponsors for her parents so they, too, could escape Austria. Instead of assistance, she was offered "more tea." Fed up with her sponsors, Lily left the house, moved to the countryside and became a nanny. Later she worked as a nurses' assistant. At one point, she was classified as an enemy alien. Ultimately, she was reunited with her parents in America where she found work creating a comic book series with women as the central protagonists. She built a successful life for herself and her family and lived happily ever after. <strong>This is a book about determination, hardship, and overcoming adversity. There aren't many Holocaust-themed books that have a happy ending, which makes this one all the more pleasurable to read.</strong>" --<em>Jewish Book World</em></p> (<i>Magazine</i>)<br><br><p>"<strong>Renowned comics historian Robbins pens this biography of Lily Ren�e, an artist who was one of only a few women to work in the comic book industry in the 1940s.</strong> Raised in a wealthy Jewish family in Vienna, Ren�e escaped to England from Nazi-occupied Austria when she was 14 years old. Most of the book recounts Ren�e's time in England as she's turned into an unpaid servant by her host family, works as a nanny and nurse's assistant, and endures the blitz. When she is finally able to join her parents in the United States, she uses her drawing skills to find work, eventually landing in comics and drawing pulp comics featuring bold, beautiful heroines. The story is told in a less than dramatic fashion, however. More space is given to Ren�e attempting to mop a kitchen floor than finding shelter during the blitz and being witness to its aftermath, for example. Characters' expressions and body language are kept simple. Extras include a German glossary, a brief history of the time in which Ren�e's story takes place, explanations of period details, and photographs of Ren�e and her family, which provide needed real-world texture." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"This graphic biography, illustrated in a retro comic book style that befits its subject, describes the life of Lily Ren�e Wilheim, a Jewish Kindertransport refugee who became a graphic artist of superwomen comic books in New York. Raised in a well-off family in Vienna in the '30s, Lily saw her idyllic childhood descend into one of prejudice, tragedy, Kristallnacht and, finally, escape. <strong>This is a smart little biography that will appeal to history buffs, comic book fans and anyone who likes a gutsy, pioneering heroine.</strong>" --<em>The New York Times Book Review</em></p> (<i>Newspaper</i>)<br><br><p>"Lily Ren�e Wilheim, born and raised in a secular Jewish family in Austria between World Wars, was just young enough to find sanctuary in the Kindertransport arranged with England in 1939. After an unhappy period spent with the family of her girlhood pen pal, she found work as a domestic and was able to join her parents in the U.S. after the war. There she found employment as a cartoonist, working on such projects as the Nazi-fighting Se�orita Rio. Throughout, Lily Ren�e is presented as a girl with understandable concerns for both her physical and emotional safety, and in relatively few pages, readers learn about aspects of postwar life including how displaced persons found work. Timmons and Oh's brightly colored art is well detailed, showing period dress and scenes in all three countries. Back matter fleshes out historical context, such as how women became the heroines in many wartime comics. <strong>With this graphic biography, Robbins, who has worked hard to bring attention to women cartoonists, offers a Holocaust survivor story that few will find familiar.</strong>" --<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"<strong>Like the comic books that Lily Ren�e Wilheim drew in the 1940s as a pioneer woman in a male-dominated industry, this biography is a tale of peril and suspense.</strong> Lily, an affluent Austrian Jewish girl, was one of the last children to be transported safely to England in 1939. After a few years with a sponsor family, she got a series of jobs caring for children and in a maternity hospital. After England entered the war, she lost contact with her parents and was later classified as an enemy alien. The tale of her reconciliation with her family in America and subsequent success as a graphic artist is classically upbeat. The book is drawn in a style that seems to imitate Wilheim's wartime comics&#x2013;gestures and expressions are stylized and formal; characters stand or move stiffly. Think <em>Brenda Starr, Girl Reporter</em>. Add to this drawing style a tendency toward melodrama and few named characters except the subject and this book might be a tough sell. Improving its odds is back matter that includes a gallery of photographs of the charismatic Lily and brief essays on subjects as diverse as the British monetary system and the Automat." --<em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"<strong>This comic-book biography of a Jewish girl's life under the Nazi jackboot and then as a refugee is low key and that much more profound for it. The panels are brightly lit, and the narrative is crisp, both of which serve to chillingly amplify the everyday banality of evil</strong><strong>.</strong> Robbins fashions Lily Ren�e Wilhelm as a young woman who simply must make the best of being shuttled from home to home as a Kindertransport refugee in England, thankful for the kindnesses while cognizant of the inequities, hopeful but not delusional. Her parents, still in Austria, haven't vanished, but they are thwarted at every turn. Bile rises, teeth clench&#x2015;it is all so quotidian. Lily toils in this and that occupation, and then comes the wholly satisfying conclusion: Lily becomes a graphic artist of superwomen stories in the United States, so fitting that it closes her tale like the thunk of a Rolls Royce door. Robbins adds a glossary and a number of short, expository pages on concentration camps, internment camps, high tea, English currency, Queen Wilhelmina, the Holland-America Line and Horn and Hardart automats to flesh out Lily's life.

Over an entire year, the author and her husband-experienced farmers themselves-took a sabbatical and traveled the length and breadth of the United States to live and work alongside some of the nation's most innovative farmers. Along the way they learned about best practices, and a whole lot about what doesn't work.<br> <br> <em>Farms with a Future</em> shares this collective wisdom in an inspirational yet practical manner; it will help beginners avoid many of the common mistakes that first-time farmers make. Just as importantly, it discusses positive ideas that can help make any farm enterprise vibrant and financially profitable. Profiles of more than a dozen representative farms help round out the invaluable information and encourage farmers to embrace their inner entrepreneur. Younger growers, in particular, will benefit by learning about "the right stuff" from both their peers and longtime experts.This book provides a useful reference for beginning and experienced farmers alike. While many other books address agricultural production, there are very few that talk about business management for long-term sustainability. <em>Farms with a Future</em> offers an approachable, colorful take on building a triple-bottom-line farming business.</p></p><p><p>Rebecca Thistlethwaite is the author of <em>Farms with a Future</em> (Chelsea Green, 2012).

The stories of innovative farmers who have embraced their 'inner entrepreneur' fill this collection and serve as ample inspiration for readers who are dreaming of their own farming ventures, as well as those who are searching for new approaches. With chapters organized around specific principles such as &#x201c;Identifying Your Market Niche&#x201d; and &#x201c;Harvesting and Processing,&#x201d; the emphasis of Thistlethwaite&#x2019;s book is incorporating necessary tools for survival and profit in a family-based business. Each chapter contains photographs of the farms and farmers, which helps drive home for the reader that these are real people who have&#x2014;through sacrifice, planning, and hard work&#x2014;found ways to farm that supports their values. Additionally, each chapter ends with 'Take-Home Messages,' a bulleted summary of dos and don&#x2019;ts that affirm much of what each family farm story demonstrates.

Most of us will not have heard of Maeve Brennan before opening this volume, yet the quality of her stories is cause for wonder. The first several are autobiographical sketches of her childhood in 1920s Dublin. In one, she takes her brother with her to the Poor Clare nuns, a closed order. Because the little boy is only 2, he gets to see the hidden lives about which his older sister is so curious: "I imagined them, silent and swift, of all ages, descending upon Robert from every part of the convent." In another, following the treaty that turned Ireland into a free state, "some unfriendly men" twice come looking for her father, a Republican. One raider even thrusts his head up the fireplace, only to cover himself and the living room in soot. Despite the disarray, her mother rejoices. "And with us chattering a delighted, incredulous accompaniment, she laughed as though her heart might break." <p> In Brennan's acute hands, this proverbial phrase has more sorrow than joy about it, and in the collection's two other sequences, the emotions are far more raw. Husbands and wives are deadlocked in loveless marriages--the men longing for escape, the women desperate for contact. These are visions of powerful feelings, powerfully quelled, and there are some heart-freezing juxtapositions. One story ends with a young couple coming together; in the very next, 27 years later, ill will is everywhere. </p><p> But Brennan, whose life seems to have been even more tragic than that of any of her characters, can also anatomize peace, or at least respite. In "The Carpet with the Big Pink Roses on It," Mrs. Bagot and her child and pets (also on the shakiest of ground with Mr. Bagot) fall into an afternoon slumber. "They all slept safely. There wasn't a sound in the house. Nobody came to the door. Nobody saw them. There on the bed they might all have been invisible, or enchanted, or, as they were for that time, forgotten." Alas, such states of grace are momentary in Brennan's houses. According to William Maxwell, the title novella--a brilliant anatomy of envy and hate--"belongs with the great short stories of this century." So do several other pieces in <i>The Springs of Affection</i>.</p>Maeve Brennan came to America from Ireland in 1934, when she was seventeen. From 1949 through the mid-1970s, she was on the staff of The New Yorker, where she made memorable contributions to &#34;The Talk of the Town&#34; under the pen name &#34;The Long-Winded Lady.&#34; She died in New York in 1993.</p><h2>The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism</h2><p><p>Gay. Straight. Or lying. It�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s as simple and straightforward as black or white, right? Or is there a gray area, where the definitions of sex and gender become blurred or entirely refocused with the deft and practiced use of a surgeon�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s knife? For some, the concept of gender �&#x20ac;" the very idea we have of ourselves as either male or female beings �&#x20ac;" is neither simple nor straightforward.<br> <br> Written by cutting-edge researcher and sex expert J. Michael Bailey, <b>The Man Who Would Be Queen</b> is a frankly controversial, intensely poignant, and boldly forthright book about sex and gender. Based on his original research, Bailey�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s book is grounded firmly in science. But as he demonstrates, science doesn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t always deliver predictable or even comfortable answers. Indeed, much of what he has to say will be sure to generate as many questions as it does answers.<br> <br> Are gay men genuinely more feminine than other men? And do they really prefer to be hairdressers rather than lumberjacks? Are all male transsexuals women trapped in men�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s bodies �&#x20ac;" or are some of them men who are just plain turned on by the idea of becoming a woman? And how much of a role do biology and genetics play in sexual orientation?<br> <br> But while Bailey�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s science is provocative, it is the portraits of the boys and men who struggle with these questions �&#x20ac;" and often with anger, fear, and hurt feelings �&#x20ac;" that will move you. You will meet Danny, an eight-year old boy whose favorite game is playing house and who yearns to dress up as a princess for Halloween. And Martin, an expert makeup artist who was plagued by inner turmoil as a youth but is now openly homosexual and has had many men as sex partners. And Kim, a strikingly sexy transsexual who still has a penis and works as a dancer and a call girl for men who like she-males while she awaits sex reassignment surgery.<br> <br> These and other stories make it clear that there are men �&#x20ac;" and men who become women �&#x20ac;" who want only to understand themselves and the society that makes them feel like outsiders. That there are parents, friends, and families that seek answers to confusing and complicated questions. And that there are researchers who hope one day to grasp the very nature of human sexuality. As the striking cover image �&#x20ac;" a distinctly muscular and obviously male pair of legs posed in a pair of low-heeled pumps �&#x20ac;" makes clear, the concept of gender, the very idea we have of ourselves as either male or female beings, is neither simple nor straightforward for some.<br> <br></p> Table of Contents<br><ul><li>Front Matter</li><li><b>PART 1 THE BOY WHO WOULD BE PRINCESS:</b> 1 Princess Danny</li><li>2 Growing Pains</li><li>3 The Boy Who Would Not Be a Girl</li><li><b>PART II THE MAN HE MIGHT BECOME:</b> 4 Gay Femininity</li><li>5 Gay Masculinity</li><li>6 Danny's Uncle</li><li>7 Is Homosexuality a Recent Invention?</li><li><b>PART III WOMEN WHO ONCE WERE BOYS:</b> 8 Terese and Cher</li><li>9 Men Trapped in Men's Bodies</li><li>10 In Search of Womanhood and Men--Autogynephilic and Homosexual Transsexuals: How To Tell Them Apart</li><li>11 Becoming a Woman</li><li>Epilogue</li><li>Further Reading</li><li>Index</li></ul></p><p>I have written a book that I knew would be controversial for several very different reasons. For example, I argue that extreme femininity in men is tightly linked with homosexuality; that it is likely to have a biological cause; that many stereotypes about gay men are true. These assertions are based on the best available scientific data, summarized in my book. <p>But I knew that the most controversial section would be the third, on transsexualism. In this section I review the evidence, which I believe is convincing, that there are two (and most likely only two) types of male-to-female transsexuals. One is the type that most people think about, comprised of males who have been overtly feminine from birth and who are unambiguously and strongly attracted to men. The other type has been unknown (or perhaps more accurately, misunderstood) by almost everyone until recently. This type is motivated something akin to a sexual fetish, and it is the image of themselves as women. That is, these are males who fantasize sexually about wearing women&#x2019;s clothes, having female anatomy, and doing feminine things. Some of them want to become women so badly that they do so. </p><p>My book has provoked a fierce negative reaction among some transsexuals. This reaction was predictable, but the controversy is too complicated to do justice to in the "reviews" section of Amazon. These hostile critics do not want you to read my book. You can only understand the controversy&#x2014;and you can only understand transsexualism&#x2014;if you do read it. </p><p>Other transsexuals have experienced satisfying self discovery and peace of mind after reading my account, which suddenly made their predicaments comprehensible to them. Transgendered people looking for answers, especially, should take the intellectual risk.</p>"Absolutely splendid." <br>-- Simon LeVay, Ph.D., author of Queer Science <p>"This is a wonderful book on an important subject." <br>-- Anne Lawrence, M.D., Ph.D., sexual medicine and transgender medicine practitioner </p><p>"With a mixture science, humanity, and fine writing, J. Michael Bailey illuminates the mysteries of sexual orientation and identity in the best book yet written on the subject. The Man Who Would Be Queen may upset the guardians of political correctness on both the left and the right, but it will be welcomed by intellectually curious people of all sexes and sexual orientations. A truly fascinating book." <br>-- Steven Pinker, Peter de Florez Professor, MIT, and author of How the Mind Works and The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature </p><p>"Bailey is one of a rare breed of writers who manages to combine first-rate science with deep psychological understanding, resulting in great breadth of vision. He takes us on an unforgettable journey into the minds and lives of feminine men. Bailey skillfully interweaves vivid case studies with cutting-edge scientific findings, placing both in a deep historical context from the sexual playground of ancient Greece to the dilemmas of gender in the modern world. Refreshingly candid, remarkably free of ideology, this book is destined to become a modern classic in the field. But readers should be prepared to have some cherished assumptions about human nature shattered." <br>-- David M.

In a narrative tour de force, Louis Crompton chronicles the lives and achievements of homosexual men and women alongside a darker history of persecution, as he compares the Christian West with the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome, Arab Spain, imperial China, and pre-Meiji Japan. </p><p> Ancient Greek culture celebrated same-sex love in history, literature, and art, making high claims for its moral influence. By contrast, Jewish religious leaders in the sixth century B.C.E. branded male homosexuality as a capital offense and, later, blamed it for the destruction of the biblical city of Sodom. When these two traditions collided in Christian Rome during the late empire, the tragic repercussions were felt throughout Europe and the New World. </p><p> Louis Crompton traces Church-inspired mutilation, torture, and burning of "sodomites" in sixth-century Byzantium, medieval France, Renaissance Italy, and in Spain under the Inquisition. But Protestant authorities were equally committed to the execution of homosexuals in the Netherlands, Calvin's Geneva, and Georgian England. The root cause was religious superstition, abetted by political ambition and sheer greed. Yet from this cauldron of fears and desires, homoerotic themes surfaced in the art of the Renaissance masters--Donatello, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Sodoma, Cellini, and Caravaggio--often intertwined with Christian motifs.

It was the world&#x2019;s first atlas. Brainchild of Abraham Ortelius, the Theatrum reflected the enormous vitality of the era, the prevailing zest for exploration and discovery, and the linked activities of international commerce and mapmaking. Paul Binding has immersed himself in the Antwerp that produced Ortelius and his atlas, and he draws on a mass of letters, personal documents, maps, and pictures to bring it vividly to life.

In 2008 the EFCA adopted a newly revised Statement of Faith. This book seeks to give clarity to the theological convictions contained in that Statement-spelling out what is affirmed and what is denied (and what is not addressed). Beyond that, it expounds these convictions-helping the reader understand and appreciate the wonderful truth contained in this brief and concise confession. Quite simply, the goal in formulating this new Statement of Faith was to set forth &#34;sound doctrine that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God,&#34; which he has now entrusted to us (1 Tim. 1:10-11). The EFCA believes that our essential theological convictions are vitally connected to this gospel, the evangel, as that gospel message has come to us through the biblical and historic stream of Evangelical Christianity. As an exposition of Evangelical convictions this book will be useful both in the EFCA and in the broader Evangelical world. This theological exposition speaks clearly but, as much as possible, without technical theological terms so that it can be profitable for all believers who need to be grounded in the essentials of the faith. Moreover, the theology set forth in this exposition is doxological-that is, it ought to lead us to exalt the greatness and grace of our God. As Paul instructs Timothy, &#34;What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus. Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you-guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us&#34; (2 Tim. 1:13-14). Evangelical Convictions was written with the prayer that it may be an instrument of the Spirit to help those in the EFCA, and faithful believers everywhere, to guard, and to bear witness to, the good deposit of the gospel.</p><p></p><h2>Crude Chronicles: Indigenous Politics, Multinational Oil, and Neoliberalism in Ecuador (American Encounters/Global Interactions)</h2><p>Ecuador is the third-largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the western United States. As the source of this oil, the Ecuadorian Amazon has borne the far-reaching social and environmental consequences of a growing U.S. demand for petroleum and the dynamics of economic globalization it necessitates.<i> Crude Chronicles</i> traces the emergence during the 1990s of a highly organized indigenous movement and its struggles against a U.S. oil company and Ecuadorian neoliberal policies. Against the backdrop of mounting government attempts to privatize and liberalize the national economy, Suzana Sawyer shows how neoliberal reforms in Ecuador led to a crisis of governance, accountability, and representation that spurred one of twentieth-century Latin America&#x2019;s strongest indigenous movements.<p></p><p>Through her rich ethnography of indigenous marches, demonstrations, occupations, and negotiations, Sawyer tracks the growing sophistication of indigenous politics as Indians subverted, re-deployed, and, at times, capitulated to the dictates and desires of a transnational neoliberal logic. At the same time, she follows the multiple maneuvers and discourses that the multinational corporation and the Ecuadorian state used to circumscribe and contain indigenous opposition. Ultimately, Sawyer reveals that indigenous struggles over land and oil operations in Ecuador were as much about reconfiguring national and transnational inequality&#x2014;that is, rupturing the silence around racial injustice, exacting spaces of accountability, and rewriting narratives of national belonging&#x2014;as they were about the material use and extraction of rain-forest resources.</p></p><p>&#34;&#34;Crude Chronicles &#34;seamlessly weaves the compelling richness of an exceptional ethnographic account with the power of a story well told. By chronicling the history of the ongoing contest that has characterized the politics of petroleum in the Ecuadorian Amazon, Sawyer brilliantly illustrates the imbricated process by which indigenous and neoliberal geophraphies are configured and reconfigured in the process of making nature, nation, and citizens. &#34;Crude Chronicles&#34; will surely become a key reference point in future debates about the cultural politics of nature.&#34;--Peter Brosius, University of Georgia<p>Suzana Sawyer is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Davis.</p></p><h2>Noisy Baby Animals (My First)</h2><p>Touch, feel, and hear the baby animals on every page of this interactive, sturdy board book, packed with appealing pictures, tactile textures, and adorable baby animal sounds.</p><p>Patricia Hegarty began working in children&#39;s publishing more years ago than she cares to remember!

Only four of the <i>Fortune</i> 500 company CEOs are women, and it's only been in the last few years that even half of the <i>Fortune</i> 500 companies have more than one female officer.<br><br>A major reason for this? Most women were never taught how to play the game of business. <br><br>Throughout her career in the supercompetitive, male-dominated media industry, Gail Evans, one of the country's most powerful executives, has met innumerable women who tell her that they feel lost in the workplace, almost as if they were playing a game without knowing the directions.<br><br>She tells them that's exactly the case: Business is indeed a game, and like any game, there are rules to playing well. For the most part, Gail has discovered, women don't know them.<br><br>Men know these rules because they wrote them, but women often feel shut out of the process because they don't know when to speak up, when to ask for responsibility, what to say at an interview, and a lot of other key moves that can make or break a career.<br><br>Now, in her book <b>Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman</b>, Gail Evans reveals the secrets to the playbook of success and teaches women at all levels of the organization--from assistant to vice president--how to play the game of business to their advantage.<br><br>Sharing with humor and candor her years of lessons from corporate life, Gail Evans gives readers practical tools for making the right decisions at work. Among the rules you will learn are:<br><br>� How to Keep Score at Work<br>� When to Take a Risk<br>� How to Deal with the Imposter Syndrome<br>� Ten Vocabulary Words That Mean Different Things to Men and Women<br>� Why Men Can be Ugly, and You Can't<br>� When to Quit Your Job<br><br>Evans is not saying that every woman has to play exactly by men's rules--not at all. Women bring many inherent traits to the workplace that can provide them with a potential advantage over men, such as a woman's ability to form relationships, or her intuition. But women do need to know the basic rules so that they can understand the full consequences of their every action and how it makes an impact on their career.<br><br>An honest and practical handbook that reveals important insights into relationships between men and women and work, <b>Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman</b>, is a must-read for every woman who wants to leverage her power in the workplace.</p><p>The fact that there are few women occupying top-level positions in corporate America has, for a long time, been blamed on a ubiquitous "glass ceiling." But according to Gail Evans, this is a tired myth implying a woman is a "person-who's-done-to instead of a person-who's-doing." In <i>Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman</i>, CNN's ebullient--and successful--executive vice president puts forth a new thesis: women are not in star positions because they haven't yet learned how to play the game.<p> The game of business is played on a field where males have been comfortable since they were very young, says Evans. It's a game where winning is the obvious (and only) objective and where aggression, self-promotion, a tough skin, and an effective display of power are the signs of a winner. Women, on the other hand, enter the game disadvantaged, having been taught to be cooperative rather than competitive, to enjoy the process rather than simply the result, and to seek approval rather than assume success. In her entertaining, informative, and practical book, Evans sets out to level the playing field by providing instructions on how men play and by teaching women to play smarter and win on their own terms. In one section, where she offers such advice as "Toot Your Own Horn," "Accept Uncertainty," and "Be an Imposter," Evans presents a common business scenario. She shows the typical male and female responses to it, analyzes the problem with the woman's reaction, and offers advice on what to do differently. Writing in light, accessible prose, Evans supports her observations with both personal and professional anecdotes and covers the gamut of women's experiences on the corporate path. Evans's message is inspiring: women can learn to play the game as well as any man <i>and</i> bring with them a unique set of skills and experiences. </p><p>It's impossible to ignore a woman who has reached the top of her profession in a tough business and is still prepared to claim that "everything I ever needed to know about business I learned driving the car pool." --<i>S. Ketchum</i></p>"I want to let you women in on a secret I've learned through my years in the corporate world: There is a set of unwritten rules in business and, while you may not choose to follow all of them, if you don't know what they are, you might as well be playing the game with both hands tied behind your back."<br>--Gail Evans<br><br>Praise for<b> Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman</b>:<br><br>"[This] book is perfect for any woman looking for a step-by-step guide to becoming just as ruthless&#x2013;and successful&#x2013;as her boss."<br>--<i>USA Today</i><br><br>"It's...<i>The Rules</i> for women on the corporate ladder, a no-nonsense look at what isn&#x2019;t fair and how to get beyond it."<br>--<i>Palm Beach Post-Cox News Service</i><br><br>"Gail Evans...has put together a practical, honest, often humorous playbook for career success that every woman (and a few men) should read...

In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of 'advanced' democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought.</p><p> In <i>Laches, Charmides,</i> and <i>Lysis,</i> Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. <i>Protagoras, Ion,</i> and <i>Meno</i> discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In <i>Gorgias,</i> Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The <i>Apology</i> (not a dialogue), <i>Crito, Euthyphro,</i> and the unforgettable <i>Phaedo</i> relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous <i>Symposium</i> and <i>Phaedrus,</i> written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. <i>Cratylus</i> discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the <i>Republic,</i> concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues <i>Euthydemus</i> deals with philosophy; metaphysical <i>Parmenides</i> is about general concepts and absolute being; <i>Theaetetus</i> reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, <i>Sophist</i> deals with not-being; <i>Politicus</i> with good and bad statesmanship and governments; <i>Philebus</i> with what is good. The <i>Timaeus</i> seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished <i>Critias</i> treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of <i>Laws</i> (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept.</p><p> The Loeb Classical Library edition of Plato is in twelve volumes.</p></p><p></p><h2>Odds Against</h2><p>"One of the greatest living suspense wirters."<br>CBS RADIO''<br>After a fall from a racehorse that permanently crippled a hand, Sid Halley joined a detective agency.

Mayer begins with the familiar poem "A Visit from St. Nicholas" and offers a brief historical overview explaining how his name became synonymous with Christmas. She then turns to the man who inspired the tradition, introducing him to her audience in precise, well-chosen words and magnificent art, primarily Italian paintings from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Nicholas, who lived 17 centuries ago in what is now Turkey, became the bishop of Myra and performed a series of miracles. He became the patron saint of children, maidens, and travelers, among others. This handsome volume, with its pages often bordered in gold, has the elegance of a book on Renaissance art, yet it is certainly accessible to children. Many of the paintings have a narrative quality that becomes more powerful for a modern audience in the context of Mayer's text, which tells the dramatic stories of Nicholas' miracles. Appendixes include an author's note linking Santa Claus with St. Nicholas, a bibliography of sources, and a list of illustrations. A well written and beautifully illustrated book about Saint Nicholas. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>Gr 3 Up-This handsome biography of Saint Nicholas is going to be more useful for saint assignments than as a Christmas book as many parents and their children will be most unhappy to be told right up front that "those longed-for gifts found under the Christmas tree are not after all left by him." Mayer starts with Clement Moore's poem "A Visit from St. Nicholas" and then leaves the Christmas holiday to provide a brief biography of the saint who died in A.D. 343. The prose is readable and direct. While some might question the author's matter-of-fact portrayal of miracles, children using this book for a report probably won't have a problem with it. Utilizing reproductions (a few of which are quite blurry) of religious art, dominated by stiff and formal works by artists from the Middle Ages, this offering probably holds more appeal for adults than it does for children. A list of illustrations cites page numbers, but, unfortunately, the text is unpaged.-A.

That&#x2019;s the question at the heart of Philip K. Dick&#x2019;s futuristic novel about political oppression, the show business of politics and the sinister potential of the military industrial complex. This wry, paranoid thriller imagines a future in which the earth has been ravaged, and cities are burnt-out wastelands too dangerous for human life. Americans have been shipped underground, where they toil in crowded industrial ant hills and receive a steady diet of inspiring speeches from a President who never seems to age.

Cooke. Summer was displaying its usual symptoms: immaculate blue sky, trace of freshly mown grass in the breeze, gen�eral feeling that all was well with the world, etc. There was a growing restlessness among the students of Public School 141, like inmates finally up for parole. Not only was June&#x2019;s thermostat set to perfection, but it was the last day of school and a Friday, to boot. Any way you cut it, Addison knew this was not a day to be spent in detention. <br> &nbsp;<br> And yet here he was. He&#x2014;Addison Cooke! The same Addison Cooke who had crossed the Amazon, outwitted cartel criminals, and rescued an Incan treasure was now standing at humble attention in the school principal&#x2019;s office, Kangol cap in hand. &#x201c;Touching on this business of skipping class,&#x201d; he began, &#x201c;this is all just a simple misun�der standing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How?&#x201d; asked the principal.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I misunderstood that you would find out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The principal leaned his elbows on the giant oak desk. He was scarcely tall enough to see over his own name plaque: Principal Ronald W. Stern. But what he lacked in stature he made up for in eyebrows. &#x201c;You mind telling me why you were skipping gym class?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not at all, I&#x2019;d be happy to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I was reading a book, that&#x2019;s the true story. I mean, the book was fiction. But the fact that I was reading the book is true.&#x201d; Addison bit his lip; it was not his best opening salvo. He clarified, &#x201c;The fact that I was reading fiction is not fiction.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Reading a book is no excuse for missing out on your education.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Addison sighed. He had only himself to blame. After escaping Incan deathtraps in the jungles of Peru, he had a hard time convincing himself that seventh-grade gym class was of any real consequence. He had figured the administration wouldn&#x2019;t mind him skipping one measly gym class on a Friday afternoon on the last day of school. He had figured wrong.<br> &nbsp;<br> Addison tried a different tack. The key to any hostage negotiation was simply to keep the kidnappers talking. &#x201c;When Gertrude Stein studied at Harvard, she turned in a final exam paper to her philosophy professor. She wrote one sentence: &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t feel like taking an exam today; it&#x2019;s too nice out.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did she get a detention?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. Her professor wrote back, &#x2018;Miss Stein, you truly understand the nature of philosophy,&#x2019; and he gave her an A.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is that true?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In philosophy, anything can be true.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The principal frowned.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The point isn&#x2019;t whether it&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; Addison continued quickly. &#x201c;The point is to believe in the bigger picture.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not giving you an A for skipping class.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I will settle for a B.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I would give you more detentions,&#x201d; said Principal Stern, &#x201c;but the school year is only so long.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Addison recognized it was time to improve his tactics. His aunt Delia and uncle Nigel had promised to take him on their summer archaeological dig in China if he could soldier through the last dregs of the school year with perfect behavior. Now here he was, staring down the barrel of a detention. It was like running a twenty-six-mile marathon, limping up to the finish line, and slipping on a banana peel.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m writing out your detention slip now. You know the drill. The pink copy is for your aunt or uncle&#x2019;s signature.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Addison realized things were getting way out of hand. He made a T with his hands, signaling a time-out. He realized, as he did it, that this proved he actually had learned something in gym class.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Time-out?&#x201d; asked Principal Stern, confused. No student had ever called a time-out on him before.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. I&#x2019;ll take off my &#x2018;student&#x2019; hat and you take off your &#x2018;principal&#x2019; hat, and we&#x2019;ll just talk to each other like two human beings. Okay?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Principal Stern slowly nodded, not sure where any of this was going.<br> &nbsp;<br> Addison sat down in the button-tufted leather chair opposite the principal&#x2019;s oak desk. He crossed his legs urbanely, picking a speck of lint off the smooth crease of his trouser leg. He favored Principal Stern with his most frank and disarming smile. &#x201c;A few million years ago, some monkeys climbed down out of trees, and now we have schools and principals and I have a detention.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are you blaming your detention on evolution?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m saying there are larger forces at work here. Here&#x2019;s the thing, Ron. May I call you Ron?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You may not call me Ron.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ronald, then.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You may not address me by my first name.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, I can&#x2014;we are in a time-out.&#x201d; Addison spoke quickly before the principal could retort. &#x201c;Ronald, what did you want to do before you became a principal?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Principal Stern decided to play along. It was, after all, a beautiful afternoon, and he had nowhere pressing to be. Besides, the detention slip was already written. &#x201c;I was a teacher. Principal seemed like a smart career move. Although in this present moment, I am regretting that choice.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How long were you a teacher?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Longer than you&#x2019;ve been alive.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And what do teachers do, Ronald?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Principal Stern puckered his eyebrows, searching for a trap in the question. &#x201c;Teach?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Precisely. They teach.&#x201d; Addison finally felt he was getting somewhere. He just needed to build the &#x201c;yes ladder.&#x201d; &#x201c;Do you value education, Ronald?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you value the pursuit of knowledge?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you value the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and human reason?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Look me in my eyes, Ron. Really look at me.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Principal Ronald Stern hoisted his eyebrows and really looked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If reading a book is wrong, I don&#x2019;t want to be right. Did you become an educator so you could punish stu�dents for reading books?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, not exactly. I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes or no, Ron! Tell me to my face: are you going to stop punishing students for trying to learn?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, I won&#x2019;t. I mean, yes, I will. Wait, what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Addison stood and crossed to the American flag that stood in the corner of the principal&#x2019;s office. The Stars and Stripes rippled proudly in the breeze of the open window. &#x201c;Ronald, if you give me a detention for learning, you will be turning your back on education, on your life&#x2019;s work, and on America. You will be spitting in the face of prog�ress, of science, and of your own dreams!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Addison tilted his chin resolutely in the air as the flag fluttered behind him. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t punish me for skipping gym class, you should pin a medal on me.&#x201d; He returned to his chair and crossed his legs. &#x201c;Time in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ronald Stern sat back in his chair, unsure what to do. &#x201c;Mr. Cooke, truancy is a crime in the state of New York. I can&#x2019;t have you skip class without consequences.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mr. Stern, if you punish me for this, the consequences will be only to the integrity of America&#x2019;s education system.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Principal Stern had heard enough. He suddenly felt exhausted, like a boxer in the twelfth round, praying for the bell.<br> &nbsp;<br> Addison knew he had the man against the ropes. He threw his widow-maker. &#x201c;If you give me a detention, you will have to see me for three more hours. If you let me go, you won&#x2019;t have to see me again for three whole months.&#x201d; Addison watched the blow land.<br> &nbsp;<br> The principal&#x2019;s eyebrows shot up to his hairline before settling back down to roost on his forehead. He crumpled the detention slip in his hand and sighed. &#x201c;Addison, you are free to go.&#x201d;</p><h2>Book of Insects, Reader</h2><p>The Book of Insects Reader</p><p></p><h2>Cro-Magnon: How the Ice Age Gave Birth to the First Modern Humans</h2><p><br>Cro-Magnons were the first fully modern Europeans?not only the creators of the stunning cave paintings at Lascaux and elsewhere, but the most adaptable and technologically inventive people that had yet lived on earth. The prolonged encounter between the Cro-Magnons and the archaic Neanderthals and between 45,000 and 30,000 years ago was one of the defining moments of history. The Neanderthals survived for some 15,000 years in the face of the newcomers, but were finally pushed aside by the Cro-Magnons' vastly superior intellectual abilities and cutting-edge technologies, which allowed them to thrive in the intensely challenging climate of the Ice Age.<br>What do we know about this remarkable takeover? Who were the first modern Europeans and what were they like? How did they manage to thrive in such an extreme environment? And what legacy did they leave behind them after the cold millennia? The age of the Cro-Magnons lasted some 30,000 years?longer than all of recorded history. <i>Cro-Magnon</i> is the story of a little known, yet seminal, chapter of human experience. <br></p><p><br>Brian Fagan was born in England and spent several years doing fieldwork in Africa. He is Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is the author of <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Great Warming</i> and many other books, including<i> Fish on Friday: Feasting, Fasting, and the Discovery of the New World,</i> and several books on climate history, including <i>The Little Ice Age</i> and <i>The Long Summer</i>.<br>Fagan&#39;s history of the emergence of modern humans spans tens of thousands of years, but his perspective is personal and immediate. His work is based on decades of study of ancient artifacts and visits to archaeological sites around the world. James Langton, who surely possesses one of the most listenable voices in audiobooks today, fits easily into the persona Fagan has defined, creating a narrative perspective that is attentive, observant, factual, open to speculation, and never dogmatic in tone. Langton&#39;s perfectly articulated rendering keeps the narrative line clear, even when its dates and names might be crowding the listener&#39;s mind. One misses the illustrations and maps contained in the book. (The book and audiobook are best experienced together.) But Fagan excels in powers of description, and he receives his due here with a narrator as engaged and as discerning as he is. D.A.W.

A separate chapter features valuable advice for evaluating one's own photographs. </p><p> Extended captions include valuable technical information and personal commentary reflective of the superb craftsmanship and stunning photography from one of the most celebrated photographers worldwide. The second edition is updated to include technical guidelines adapted for both digital and film photographers. </p></p><p><p> <b>Freeman Patterson</b> began to work in photography in 1965. He co-founded the Namaqualand Photographic Workshops in southern Africa and has given numerous workshops in the United States, Israel, England, New Zealand, and Australia. He has published eleven books and has written for many national magazines. In 2001, Patterson received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the North American Nature Photography Association. </p><p><b> Learning to explore </b></p><p> This book about observing and photographing the world around you is a gift to you from my students -- hundreds and hundreds of photographers who have attended workshops over the years, contributed their own ideas, and tackled assignments with enthusiasm, imagination, and determination. They have inspired me with their remarkable images of everyday things and given me the direct impetus for this project by encouraging me to consider an assignment--oriented book on the subject. </p><p> As much as possible, I have based the structure of the book on the week-long workshops I conduct with teaching partners in both New Brunswick Canada, and Namaqualand, South Africa. Enrolment in these is limited to 15 or 16 participants, and in the last 30 years women and men of all ages -- from 10 to 91 -- and levels of expertise have taken part. The only assumption I have made here is that readers have a basic knowledge of how cameras -- film or digital -- and lenses work. </p><p> Most workshop days include three distinct instructional components: 1/ an illustrated lecture or two; 2/ a field trip or assignment; and 3/ evaluation of photographs made by the students on the previous day. </p><p> I begin my classroom teaching the first day with informal remarks about barriers to seeing and ways to demolish them, and with a comparison of linguistic design (the ways in which we arrange and use words) and visual design. Light is the raw material of photography, and I discuss how the two kinds of contrasts it produces -- those of tone and those of color -- are the primary visual elements of any composition, actually creating the lines, shapes, textures, and perspective (the secondary visual elements) on which all visual expression depends. On subsequent days, as in the next two chapters of this book, I consider each of these building blocks in turn and then present methods of arranging them in picture space for the clear expression of facts, ideas, and feelings. Near the end of the week I consolidate and review everything by showing students images I've made in a wide variety of situations and discussing how I applied the principles described in my lectures. </p><p> Since I can't accompany you on your field trips, in the evaluation and assignment sections of this book I offer you a selection of my own photographs made in the field, with the same kinds of suggestions I offer workshop students -- key opportunities for dealing with particular subject matter, playing with design, trying different lenses, and ways of overcoming potential difficulties with technical derails like lighting and exposure. My intention is to open up possibilities you might not think of on your own, to help you discard old habits of seeing. </p><p> After many years of teaching photography and visual design, I've come to realize that most participants regard photography workshops, consciously or unconsciously, as a passport, an opportunity to gain access to something far more important than the medium itself -- their creative selves. Sometimes their desire to grow is so deeply buried under an accumulation of personal baggage that it's difficult to acknowledge its existence, much less to do anything about it. This is where an instructor or a friend who is sensitive to the situation can help. </p><p> I remember a morning several years ago when I was in the field with an amateur photographer who had enrolled in a workshop as a retirement gift to herself. On this particular morning, she wanted to make pictures of an especially beautiful stand of wild rhododendron. Although she obviously loved the flowers and listened as I encouraged her to try various approaches to photographing them, every composition she showed me was more or less the same as all the others -- a small section of shrubbery viewed from her normal height, a definite center of interest always placed in a "one-third position" (that is, one-third up or across the picture plane), and maximum depth of field to ensure that every last leaf and blossom was in focus. Some of her compositions were quite pleasing but, considered as a group, they all followed her rigid formula, completely masking her feelings about the subject matter. She might as well have been photographing a car, an old barn, or clouds at sunset for all the difference it made in the way she composed her pictures. After nearly an hour of trying, unsuccessfully, to loosen her up, I decided to try some shock treatment. </p><p> "Alice," I remarked, "I bet you spent your entire life teaching English -- grammar, sentence structure, and things like that." She stared at me with a look of complete shock, like a child caught in the act of doing something expressly forbidden, and murmured in a voice so low I could scarcely hear her, "How did you know?" </p><p> "Because," I replied, "you love rules too much; you're afraid to experiment, to let go." And then she said something that made me infinitely sad: "It's just that I don't have any imagination." </p><p> At that point I wanted to grab both her arms and teach her how to dance. I wanted to waltz her in great, wide arcs through a field of early daisies, to swing her in circles above the shrubbery and then, exhausted, to lie on the grass as we peered up through the canopy of green leaves and pink rhododendron flowers at tiny patches of blue sky. Instead, I said, "Nobody can survive for more than a minute without using imagination. Your problem isn't a lack of imagination, but an inability to relax. You're scared stiff of trying anything new for fear that you'll make a mistake, but the whole point of your photographing these flowers is to focus on their beauty, not on your uptightness. The flowers are the subject matter, not your worries and fears." Emboldened by my own candor, I continued on in high gear. "Of course, you'll make mistakes. Great big fat ones. You'll come up with some terrible compositions, and you'll expose some good ones badly. You may even become so frustrated that you'll just want to go back to your cabin. But, if you'll accept some guidance and a few specific suggestions from me, I'm willing to hang in for another hour with you. I can guarantee that you'll make a couple of pictures that excite you and that you'll feel good about what you've accomplished." </p><p> Alice listened. Even better, she heard. "Should I choose a new camera position?" she asked. "Yes," I replied. "Instead of standing on the outside, why not move right in among the leaves and the blossoms?" </p><p> Moments later, surrounded by foliage and flowers on all sides, she called out, "I can't get everything in focus." And then she added, "Maybe I shouldn't even try, but just use shallow depth of field instead." </p><p> "Excellent idea," I called back. She was already using her imagination. </p><p> We're all like Alice -- perhaps not all the time, or even most of the time, but usually too much of the time. By seeing and doing things repeatedly in the same way, we fail to appreciate the newness and freshness that we can experience in every environment, however familiar, and we risk closing down our creative selves. It may take a conscious act of will on our part, some shoving by a friend, even a shock of some sort to make us open our eyes and our minds to what's around us every day of our lives. But once we admit to ourselves that far fields are not necessarily greener, that visual exploration is possible wherever we happen to be, we can make good photographs of anything, anywhere. </p><p> Over the years I've frequently chosen a familiar object, scene, situation, or person and promised myself that I would keep exploring visually until I'd made at least twenty good compositions. (I have no upper limit.) Quite often I've selected subjects that, initially, didn't interest me, thus making the assignments more challenging than subjects I'm naturally attracted to, and also increasing the potential for greater discovery. One such assignment was to photograph in an enclosed por</p></p><h2>Great Sets</h2><p>Important Note about PRINT ON DEMAND Editions: You are purchasing a print on demand edition of this book.

He appeared on the cover of <em>Newsweek</em> and <em>The Saturday</em> <em>Review</em>, was written about in <em>Time</em>, <em>Life</em>, <em>The Nation</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, and <em>The National Review</em>, was the subject of an hour-long documentary on NBC, and had an unforgettable walk-on role in Woody Allen's <em>Annie Hall</em>, playing himself. A seminal thinker, he introduced popular culture as a subject for serious thought, and started people thinking about how technology--especially electronic media--shapes the way we perceive the world. <br> McLuhan corresponded with a vast number of people, from Hubert Humphrey and Jimmy Carter to popular advice columnist Ann Landers. Indeed, his correspondents amount to a Who's Who of western culture, both high and low, including Duke Ellington, Woody Allen, Jacques Maritain, Rollo May, Susan Sontag, Eugene Ionesco, Wyndham Lewis, Ezra Pound, and Bob Newhart. At times playful and at times profound, his letters offer an invaluable commentary on McLuhan's work and, in some instances, the most lucid and detailed explanation of his ideas available. <br> A brilliant letter-writer and a genial man who made friends all over the world, Marshall McLuhan left behind a correspondence that brims with insight, good humor, and the love of language and word play. His letters offer an invaluable glimpse of the private life and inner thoughts of one of the great minds of the twentieth century.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor</em>: <br> <strong>William Toye</strong> was the General Editor of <em>The Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature</em> and co-editor of <em>The Oxford Anthology of Canadian Literature</em>. <strong>Matie Molinaro</strong> was McLuhan's agent. <strong>Corinne McLuhan</strong> was McLuhan's wife.<br></p><h2>Cowboy Charm School (The Haywire Brides, 1)</h2><p><p>"A great story by a wonderful author." &#x2015;<strong>DEBBIE MACOMBER</strong>, #1 <em>New York Times</em> Bestselling Author, for <em>Left at the Altar</em></p><p><strong>When Texas Ranger Brett Tucker accidentally derails a wedding, <br> he's determined to bring the estranged couple back together...<br> but he never dreamed he'd start falling for the bride!</strong><br> <br> Texas Ranger Brett Tucker hates to break up a wedding, but the groom&#x2015;notorious criminal Frank Foster&#x2015;is a danger to any woman.

In the decades after World War II, they changed American poetry forever by putting themselves at risk in their poems in a new and provocative way. Their daring work helped to inspire the popular style of poetry now known as "confessional." But partly as a result of their openness, they have become better known for their tumultuous lives&#x2015;afflicted by mental illness, alcoholism, and suicide&#x2015;than for their work. This book reclaims their achievement by offering critical "biographies of the poetry"&#x2015;tracing the development of each poet's work, exploring their major themes and techniques, and examining how they transformed life into art. An ideal introduction for readers coming to these major American poets for the first time, it will also help veteran readers to appreciate their work in a new light. 6 illustrations</p><p>Adam Kirsch is a poet, literary critic, and the director of the master&#x2019;s program in Jewish studies at Columbia University. He is a also columnist for Tablet and a contributor to the New York Times Book Review and The New Yorker. He lives in New York.The "great constellation" of writers Kirsch discusses have been praised as the first wave of "confessional" poets, but he finds this received opinion misguided. What makes these poets special, he argues, is not that they spilled their emotional guts on the page, but the ways in which they transformed these personal experiences into art: "their primary motive was aesthetic," he says. Kirsch, book critic for the <i>New York Sun,</i> emphasizes the "deliberate manipulation of tone and language" in poems that some readers have mistaken for straightforward autobiographical expressions, particularly in discussing Lowell (whom he considers the best American poet born in the last century). Such discussion sets the tone for the later chapters; the sameness of the thesis is mitigated by very close readings of each poet's verse in support of Kirsch's account of the poetry's development. Where Kirsch finds weaknesses, such as a decline in Schwartz's talents or Plath's bad taste in equating her father with the Nazis in "Daddy," he addresses them frankly. His confident and comprehensive assessments bear a great resemblance in method and tone to those of his former teacher, Helen Vendler, and will engage any reader looking for a fresh take on some of America's best-known poets. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tour.</p><p>The track record of the <i>Elegant but Easy Cookbook</i> speaks for itself. Almost 40 years and 500,000 copies in print is the figure of best-selling novels, not cookbooks. Yet co-authors Marian Burros and Lois Levine have endured, and <i>The New Elegant but Easy Cookbook</i> is destined to continue the tradition. The concept for the book hasn't changed: it's filled with recipes that can be prepared ahead of time so the cook can enjoy the party instead of hovering over the stove. However, the old book had become dated, often relying on canned and prepared ingredients that--while perfectly acceptable in 1960--did nothing to reflect more modern tastes. <i>The New Elegant but Easy Cookbook</i> manages to maintain the integrity of the original while taking a new culinary approach with more emphasis on fresh ingredients and world cuisine. Only 50 favorite recipes are included from the original volume (including Lois's Original Plum Torte, the most requested recipe reprinted in the <i>New York Times</i>, ever), while the rest are a dynamic new approach to simple and easy cooking. Dishes like Chicken Breasts Stuffed with Goat Cheese or Couscous are elegant, yet still sturdy enough to be prepared in advance. Burros and Levine have done their homework, and it shows. None of the recipes are to be underestimated because they are simple or can live in a refrigerator until mealtime. The authors have also provided ten foolproof menus, planning guides for large dinner parties, and ingredients lists with mail-order sources. In an age where time has become a precious commodity, <i>The New Elegant but Easy Cookbook</i> provides a resource to help free the chef from the kitchen to enjoy the ritual of the meal. <i>--Mark O.

Why did the nation's top accounting firms give such companies clean audit reports? Where were the regulators and whistleblowers who should expose fraudulent CEOs before they loot their companies for hundreds of millions of dollars?</p><p>In this expert insider's account of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s, William Black lays bare the strategies that corrupt CEOs and CFOs&#x2014;in collusion with those who have regulatory oversight of their industries&#x2014;use to defraud companies for their personal gain. Recounting the investigations he conducted as Director of Litigation for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, Black fully reveals how Charles Keating and hundreds of other S&amp;L owners took advantage of a weak regulatory environment to perpetrate accounting fraud on a massive scale. He also authoritatively links the S&amp;L crash to the business failures of the early 2000s, showing how CEOs then and now are using the same tactics to defeat regulatory restraints and commit the same types of destructive fraud.</p><p>Black uses the latest advances in criminology and economics to develop a theory of why "control fraud"&#x2014;looting a company for personal profit&#x2014;tends to occur in waves that make financial markets deeply inefficient. He also explains how to prevent such waves. Throughout the book, Black drives home the larger point that control fraud is a major, ongoing threat in business that requires active, independent regulators to contain it. His book is a wake-up call for everyone who believes that market forces alone will keep companies and their owners honest.</p></p><p>WILLIAM K.

Her parents told me so while I watched her playing happily on the front lawn of their home, and the news hit me so hard I nearly lost my breath.&#x201c;Does she know?&#x201d;&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t told her,&#x201d; Molly Carlson said. &#x201c;But, yes, I think she knows. We took her to enough doctors, even took her to the Mayo Clinic.&#x201d;&#x201c;What did the doctors tell you?&#x201d;&#x201c;Leukemia,&#x201d; Richard Carlson answered from across the living room, answered as if he wished to spare his wife the pain of speaking the word. &#x201c;They say her body is producing too many white blood corpuscles. They say her spleen and lymph glands are enlarged. They say she needs a bone marrow transplant or she&#x2019;ll die. Only, neither of us is compatible and finding a donor outside the family, that&#x2019;s a twenty thousand to one shot. Leastwise, that&#x2019;s what they say.&#x201d;Carlson was a big man, big in every direction, 275 at least and not all of it was fat. His eyes were a pale green and what little hair he had was gray. All the other times I had seen him he had worn the faded jeans and T-shirts of a working contractor&#x2014;a guy who not only designed and sold lake homes, but who also dug foundations and hammered nails. Today he was wearing his Sunday best: black boots, designer jeans, a checkered shirt with imitation pearl snaps, and a belt with a garish buckle declaring his fidelity to Winston Cup racing. He lived in a three-story house that he had built himself in a neighborhood where all the other houses were close to the ground. Somehow he had managed to build it without uprooting the dozen magnificent oak, maple, and birch trees that surrounded it. It was because of the house and trees that I had hired Carlson to build my own lake home.&#x201c;You want me to find a donor for Stacy?&#x201d; I asked.&#x201c;We want you to find our other daughter, Jamie,&#x201d; Carlson said.&#x201c;Jamie,&#x201d; repeated Mrs. Carlson. Her voice was soft, almost a whisper. She was wearing a powder-blue dress printed with yellow flowers. She was eighteen inches shorter and 150 pounds lighter than her husband, but her hair was just as gray. She sat in a chair, her hands folded neatly in her lap, and watched Stacy through a large bay window. She never took her eyes off the girl.&#x201c;We had&#x2014;we have another daughter. Jamie. She left us seven years ago. Stacy was only two back then. We had her late. She was&#x2014;a present. Anyway, Jamie left us and never came back. We tried to find her, even thought about hiring a private investigator. Then we figured, well, that&#x2019;s the way Jamie wanted it. Only now ...&#x201d;&#x201c;Jamie might be a compatible donor,&#x201d; I volunteered. &#x201c;Jamie might be able to save Stacy&#x2019;s life.&#x201d;Molly nodded. &#x201c;Family members are best. And Jamie has a rare blood type, B-negative, same as Stacy. The doctors say, the first thing you need to be a compatible donor is the same blood type.&#x201d;A missing person. Missing persons made me nervous. Most missing persons are missing because they want to be and rarely does anything good come of finding them. Still, Stacy Carlson was nine years old and she was dying. Her hair was long and blond and tied in a ponytail. Her eyes were vibrant green, her smile was bright enough to melt snow. I couldn&#x2019;t possibly imagine the pain and anguish Molly and Richard Carlson must have suffered as they watched their daughter, knowing she was literally dying before their eyes. When I was in the sixth grade I lost my mother to a brain tumor literally overnight. My father died just five months ago, yet his passing too was fairly quick, although we had both seen it coming. This was something else. Losing a child, slowly ...&#x201c;Tell me about Jamie,&#x201d; I said.&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll try to find her?&#x201d; Molly asked, her face bright with hope.&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t promise anything, but yes, ma&#x2019;am, I&#x2019;ll try.&#x201d;Molly squeezed my hands like it was a done deal. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said.&#x201c;You understand, right? Richard told you I&#x2019;m not a private investigator? I don&#x2019;t have a license. I don&#x2019;t have legal standing.&#x201d;&#x201c;He said you used to be a policeman.&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes. For eleven years in St. Paul.&#x201d;&#x201c;He said you help people.&#x201d;&#x201c;Sometimes. When I can.&#x201d;&#x201c;I appreciate this, Mac,&#x201d; Carlson said. In all my previous dealings with Carlson, he had spoken loudly. I figured he always spoke that way, big men sometimes do. Yet in his own home his voice was small. It was what my mother had called &#x201c;an indoor voice.&#x201d;&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you how much I appreciate it,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;Only, I&#x2019;m not asking for charity. I know you usually do these things for free, but I&#x2019;m a man who likes to pay his own way. Just ask anybody in Grand Rapids. Money&#x2019;s not a problem.&#x201d;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Money&#x2019;s not a problem with me, either. I have plenty.&#x201d;&#x201c;I pay my own way,&#x201d; Carlson insisted.&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll talk about it later.&#x201d;&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;ve been thinking about extending the deck at your place, maybe screening off part of it.&#x201d;&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll talk about it later.&#x201d;Carlson nodded.&#x201c;You spell your name S-O-N, right?&#x201d; I said.&#x201c;What?&#x201d;&#x201c;Your name. S-O-N or S-E-N?&#x201d;&#x201c;S-E-N is Danish. I&#x2019;m Swedish,&#x201d; Carlson answered with a certain pride.I made a note of it on a yellow legal pad I stole from my girlfriend&#x2019;s office. &#x201c;How do you spell your daughter&#x2019;s name?&#x201d;&#x201c;J-A-M-I-E.&#x201d;&#x201c;Middle name?&#x201d;&#x201c;Anne,&#x201d; he said, then added, &#x201c;with an E.&#x201d;I wrote it down. &#x201c;Jamie Anne Carlson. Pretty name.&#x201d;&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; Molly smiled slightly and looked down at her hands, still folded in her lap.Carlson sat in an old, stuffed chair that had carried too much weight for too long and stared at a spot on the wall that no one else could see, leaving his wife to answer my questions.&#x201c;It was the year Jamie graduated from high school,&#x201d; Molly said. &#x201c;Right after the Fourth&#x2014;the weekend after the Fourth&#x2014;she just took the clothes that would fit into one suitcase and left. We thought she would come back when her money ran out. She didn&#x2019;t. When she didn&#x2019;t come back by September, we went to the police. They said they couldn&#x2019;t help us. They said since she wasn&#x2019;t a minor and since there wasn&#x2019;t any indication of foul play&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the phrase they used, foul play&#x2014;well, they said they couldn&#x2019;t do anything.&#x201d;&#x201c;We thought of looking for her ourselves,&#x201d; Carlson said. &#x201c;Hiring a private detective. But I guess we didn&#x2019;t see any point in it. Besides, we always thought she&#x2019;d call. We always thought she&#x2019;d come home.&#x201d;&#x201c;Why did she leave?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Was she unhappy?&#x201d;&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t seem unhappy,&#x201d; Molly said.&#x201c;Did you have a fight, a serious disagreement of some kind?&#x201d;&#x201c;No. I don&#x2019;t remember a fight. Truth is&#x2014;truth is, Mr. McKenzie, we don&#x2019;t know why she left. One day she was living here perfectly fine, talking about going to the community college in the fall. Next day she was gone.&#x201d;&#x201c;Boyfriend?&#x201d;&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Molly was adamant. It was the first time she had raised her voice. &#x201c;My Jamie wasn&#x2019;t like that.&#x201d;&#x201c;Something made her leave,&#x201d; I reminded her.&#x201c;I guess she just wanted to see some of the world.&#x201d;&#x201c;The world.&#x201d; Carlson spat the word like it was an obscenity.Molly stared at him for a moment before continuing.&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t like it here. She said there was nothing for someone her age to do.&#x201d;Carlson shook his head in disbelief.&#x201c;Plenty to do,&#x201d; he insisted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like Grand Rapids is some hick town.&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes, it is,&#x201d; said Molly. &#x201c;We like it, but ... Mr. McKenzie, Jamie was young and she was pretty, she was smart and she was bored. She wanted to leave here and she knew we disapproved, knew we would try to talk her out of it ... .&#x201d;&#x201c;Maybe so, but she didn&#x2019;t have to just up and go like that. Without saying good-bye. Without even leaving a note. That ain&#x2019;t right.&#x201d;<i>And she hasn&#x2019;t tried to contact you again, not once in seven years</i>, I thought but didn&#x2019;t say.&#x201c;No, it isn&#x2019;t right,&#x201d; I agreed.&#x201c;Where do you think Jamie went?&#x201d; I asked.&#x201c;The Cities,&#x201d; Molly said. &#x201c;Where else?&#x201d;In Minnesota? There was no place else, I agreed silently.&#x201c;Do you know Jamie&#x2019;s social security number? It&#x2019;ll help me find her.&#x201d;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Molly said. &#x201c;I know she had one&#x2014;the government gave her one when she was born. It&#x2019;s probably around here somewhere.&#x201d;I took a white card from my wallet. I had five hundred printed about a year ago with just my name and phone number. I think I had given out twenty so far.&#x201c;If you can find her social security number, call me.&#x201d;&#x201c;R. McKenzie,&#x201d; Molly read slowly. &#x201c;What does the R stand for?&#x201d;Usually when people ask that question, I simply answer, &#x201c;My first name.&#x201d; For some reason I told Molly the truth.&#x201c;Rushmore.&#x201d;&#x201c;Rushmore? I never heard that before.&#x201d;&#x201c;My parents took a vacation to the Badlands of South Dakota. They told me I was conceived in a motor lodge near Mount Rushmore, so that&#x2019;s what they named me. I&#x2019;m sure they thought it was a good idea at the time. Anyway, it could have been worse. I could have been Deadwood.&#x201d;Both Carlson and Molly thought that was pretty funny. &#x2019;Course, they had never had to raise their hands when teachers called &#x201c;Rushmore&#x201d; on the first day of school.&#x201c;Driver&#x2019;s license?&#x201d; I asked.&#x201c;Jamie had one. I don&#x2019;t know the number or anything.&#x201d;I made note of that on the legal pad, too. The Department of Motor Vehicles would be one of my first stops.&#x201c;You said she was talking about going to a two-year college. What major?&#x201d;&#x201c;She wanted to be a paralegal and work in a law office.&#x201d;I made a note of that, then said, &#x201c;I could use a photograph of her.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get it.&#x201d; Molly rose from the chair and went into an adjacent dining room.Carlson watched her leave, then said, &#x201c;You might wanna try talking to Merci Cole,&#x201d; his voice dropping several decibels.&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;If I had trouble hearing Carlson, his wife did not. A moment later, she was standing under the arch that separated the living room from the dining room.&#x201c;Merci Cole? Why do you say that?&#x201d;&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Merci Cole?&#x201d; I asked, writing her name on the yellow pad.&#x201c;She was a friend of Jamie&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Molly answered, still watching her husband.&#x201c;Friend,&#x201d; Carlson muttered under his breath. It was another word he didn&#x2019;t seem to like. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say they were friends.&#x201d;&#x201c;Maybe not a friend.&#x201d; Molly turned away from her husband. &#x201c;But they knew each other. Merci ran with a wild crowd&#x2014;not Jamie&#x2019;s type of people at all. I don&#x2019;t think Merci received much supervision at home. She didn&#x2019;t have a father, she was born illegitimate. Her momma worked all the time at the paper mill. She died&#x2014;when did she die?&#x201d;&#x201c;Two years, three months ago,&#x201d; Carlson said. Molly seemed surprised that he knew the answer.&#x201c;They became friendly when they were both up for queen at that festival they had at the end of the school year,&#x201d; Molly added. &#x201c;Spring Fling. They both lost. People said it was because they were both tall with blond hair and green eyes. They split the vote and the girl with dark hair won. The girls spent a great deal of time together during the contest. They seemed to have this, I don&#x2019;t know, rapport.&#x201d; She turned toward her husband. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t know why you think Merci had anything to do with Jamie leaving.&#x201d;&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say she did.&#x201d;&#x201c;Well, then ...&#x201d;&#x201c;Well, then&#x2014;they both left at nearly the same time.&#x201d;&#x201c;So?&#x201d;&#x201c;So, I don&#x2019;t know, maybe they ran into each other.&#x201d;&#x201c;Merci was a thief,&#x201d; Molly said.This time Carlson didn&#x2019;t argue. Instead, he found his spot on the wall and stared some more. Molly sighed in resignation and went back to watching her daughter through the window.&#x201c;Tell me about it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Anybody.&#x201d;&#x201c;Merci was a waitress at the diner near the mill,&#x201d; Carlson said. &#x201c;Leastwise she was until she and the Steele boy, Richie, ran off with money they stole from the till. Didn&#x2019;t take the deputies long to catch &#x2019;em, neither. They didn&#x2019;t even get as far as Duluth. Oh, they swore they were innocent, said they didn&#x2019;t steal anything, said they were running away to get married. But the money was sure enough missing and they were sure enough leaving in a hurry. After she was arrested, Merci used her one phone call to contact Jamie. Jamie used her savings to bail Merci out.&#x201d;&#x201c;Why would she do that?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;You said they weren&#x2019;t close.&#x201d;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Molly answered.&#x201c;What happened after Merci was arrested?&#x201d;&#x201c;The Steele boy, his father is big over at the paper mill,&#x201d; Carlson continued. &#x201c;So you know the cops went easy on him once the old man replaced the money that was stolen. Merci they told to get out of town. They said if she wasn&#x2019;t gone within forty-eight hours they were going to arrest her. So off she goes.&#x201d;I nodded. It was a typical tactic of a small town police force. Whenever the rurals have a problem that isn&#x2019;t worth their time and aggravation&#x2014;or when the fix is in&#x2014;they just tell the suspect to grab the next stage out of Dodge and don&#x2019;t come back.&#x201c;That was toward the end of June,&#x201d; Carlson said. &#x201c;Week or so before Jamie left.&#x201d;&#x201c;One thing has nothin&#x2019; to do with the other,&#x201d; Molly insisted.&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say it did,&#x201d; Carlson said.I jotted the facts down on the yellow pad along with a question: <i>Was 18-year-old Jamie&#x2019;s sense of justice so offended by the treatment of her friend that she would abandon her family and home?</i>Molly shook her head at her husband, then gave me the photograph, a two-by-three high school graduation shot. It showed a young woman posed against a dark, marbled background. She was beautiful. Bright green eyes, hair like a palomino pony, skin&#x2014;you knew not so much as a pimple ever dared blemish that skin. I looked from the photo to the Carlsons to the little girl playing quietly outside and then back to the photo. How did Richard and Molly Carlson ever produce a child who looked like this? Twice?&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in touch.&#x201d;Molly squeezed my hand. Again she said, &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;I shook hands with Carlson and went to my Jeep Grand Cherokee parked in their driveway. Stacy waved as I drove away. I waved back.<br>Ten minutes later I parked in front of the Judy Garland Museum, Judy singing &#x201c;Somewhere over the Rainbow&#x201d; on a weather-battered speaker, the ticket taker singing along. Kirsten Sager Whitson was leaning against the building, waiting for me.&#x201c;Sorry I took so long.&#x201d; I gestured toward the museum. &#x201c;How was it?&#x201d;&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she answered without enthusiasm. I reached for her hand. She pulled it away and filled it with her purse, making it seem like a casual gesture instead of the deliberate snub I knew it to be. She moved quickly to the passenger door of my SUV, opening it before I had the chance to do it for her.A visit to the museum&#x2014;Judy Garland had been born Francis Gumm in Grand Rapids; her family later moved to Duluth&#x2014;had been Kirsten&#x2019;s idea, an alternative to meeting one of my &#x201c;cases.&#x201d; Kirsten didn&#x2019;t approve of my occasional forays into detective work and said so. She thought they were common, even used that word once. &#x201c;Common.&#x201d; I reminded her that I was eleven years a police officer. &#x201c;How common is that?&#x201d; Only that was before Teachwell and, in Kirsten&#x2019;s world view, didn&#x2019;t count.Teachwell&#x2019;s company and insurance carrier had agreed to pay a finder&#x2019;s fee of fifty cents on ...</p><h2>On Beyond Zebra (Dr Seuss)</h2><p>In this rip-roaring story a young boy delights in explaining how his alphabet starts where our alphabet ends. Carrying on beyond Z for zebra, we find letter Yuzz for Yuzz-a-ma-Tuzz, and Glikk as in Glikker, who lives in wild weeds and spends his time juggling with cinnamon seeds...With his unique combination of hilarious stories, zany pictures and riotous rhymes, Dr. Seuss has been delighting young children and helping them learn to read for over fifty years. Creator of the wonderfully anarchic Cat in the Hat, and ranked among the UK&#39;s top ten favourite children&#39;s authors, Dr. Seuss is a global best-seller, with over 650 million books sold worldwide.As part of a major rebrand programme, HarperCollins is relaunching Dr. Seuss&#39;s best-selling books. In response to consumer demand, bright new cover designs incorporate much-needed guidance on reading levels. The standard paperbacks divide into three reading strands - Blue Back Books for parents to share with young children, Green Back Books for budding readers to tackle on their own, and Yellow Back Books for older, more fluent readers to enjoy. This is a Yellow Back book.</p><p>A thoroughly Seussian tweak of the alphabet-book tradition, <i>On Beyond Zebra</i> is about all the letters that most people ignore--the ones that come after Z. Our hero (instantly recognizable to most Seuss fans as the boy who captured Thing One and Thing Two in <i>The Cat in the Hat</i>) takes his young friend, Conrad Cornelius O'Donald O'Dell, on a guided tour of all the weird creatures that begin with letters such as <i>Yuzz</i>, <i>Wumbus</i>, and <i>Glikk</i>. "And Nuh is the letter I use to spell Nutches, Who live in small caves, known as Nitches, for hutches." The message is pretty simple: the alphabet pins down boring old "reality," but if you explore further afield there are more interesting worlds to discover. "So, on beyond Z! It's high time you were shown, / That you really don't know all there is to be known." Explorers in need of guidance will even find a table of useful new letters (a <i>beyondabet</i>? a <i>WumbaGlikk</i>?) in the back. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Richard Farr</i>lor.

Reprint.</p><p>Richard Laymon was born in Chicago in 1947 and grew up in California. Four of his books have been shortlisted for the Bram Stoker Award, which he won in 2001 with THE TRAVELLING VAMPIRE SHOW. Among his many acclaimed works of horror and suspense are THE STAKE, SAVAGE, AFTER MIDNIGHT and the four novels in the Beast House Chronicles: THE CELLAR, THE BEAST HOUSE, THE MIDNIGHT TOUR and FRIDAY NIGHT IN BEAST HOUSE. He died in February 2001.At their best, Laymon's cackling horrors (The Stake, 1991; Night Visions 7, 1989) are the nastiest around--sleek, black- humored, skirting (if not slipping over) the edge of pornoviolence. Here, though, he injects them into a floundering picaresque historical about Jack the Ripper--set partly in the Old West- -resulting in his only seriously dull book yet. Even Laymon's usual thrumming prose is missing here, replaced by a faux-plucky narration (``It wasn't a job I could walk away from''; ``Right then I vowed to save her'') by 15-year-old Londoner Trevor Bentley, who, one dark-and-stormy night in 1988, goes searching for a bobby to corral the lout who's beaten his mom. Wandering the streets, Trevor is attacked by thugs who strip him; seeking clothes, he breaks into an apartment but hides under the bed when the occupant returns--a whore accompanied by none other than the Ripper, who mutilates the woman while the boy cowers inches below: a wicked beginning that Laymon soon squanders. Trevor follows ``the fiend'' only to be shanghaied--along with luscious young Trudy Armitage--aboard the Armitage family yacht, which the Ripper has pirated, aiming to sail to the fresh killing-ground of America. Sundry tortures, mostly of Trudy, make the voyage pass quickly; arriving in the US, the Ripper rips Trudy and escapes, trailed by Trevor, who loses his prey but is taken in by a retired general and his daughter, who tutors the boy in sex. Long months later, reading of savage murders in Tombstone, Trevor rides the rails west, where he takes up with outlaws, dallies with yet another pretty girl, and, at last, confronts the Ripper in a blood- spouting finale. Laymon dedicates this meandering mistake to his agent, who, he says, suggested ``an English setting...so this book is your fault.'' Okay--but Laymon himself should have known better. And next time, with luck, will. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Stone Barrington arrived at his table at the same time as his usual Knob Creek on the rocks and made a mental note to increase the waiter&#x2019;s tip. This generosity was blown right out of his mind as he took his first welcome sip, because entering the restaurant immediately after him, as if she had been following him in another cab, was his girlfriend, Tatiana Orlovsky.<br>Stone was surprised to see her, because earlier in the day he had asked her to dinner and she had declined. Her excuse had been better than the I-have-to-wash-my-hair standby, but not much, and she had declined an invitation the evening before as well. They had been seeing each other for some months, and she pleased him more and more. He stood up to greet her.<br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;May I take your coat and get you a drink? I have a business dinner in a few minutes, but we have time.&#x201d;<br>She sat down without removing her coat, a bad sign. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not staying. There&#x2019;s something I have to say to you.&#x201d;<br>Very bad sign: &#x201c;Say to you,&#x201d; not &#x201c;talk with you.&#x201d; His inference was that a response would not be entertained. &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; he said, taking a long drag on his bourbon. He had a feeling he was going to need it.<br>&#x201c;Henry is moving back in,&#x201d; she said. Henry Kennerly was her estranged husband, and in Stone&#x2019;s experience and from her stories, he was an unreconstructed drunk and bully.<br>&#x201c;Tati,&#x201d; Stone said, as gently as possible, &#x201c;are you out of your fucking mind?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s been sober for ninety-one days,&#x201d; she replied, choosing not to address the issue of her sanity. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s never done that before.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And how long do you expect him to remain in that condition?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a new man, or rather an old one, the one I knew when I first met him. He has melted my heart.&#x201d;<br>Stone felt his sex life leaving his body, like a departing spirit. &#x201c;Tati...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; she said, holding up a hand like a traffic cop. &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t do any good to talk about it. Our time together has been wonderful, and I&#x2019;ve enjoyed every moment of it, but it&#x2019;s not going anywhere, and besides, this is my marriage I&#x2019;m talking about.&#x201d;<br>Stone wanted to remind her that it had been an unpleasant and abusive marriage for years, but he uncharacteristically managed to sense the obvious, that she was in no mood to talk. He shrugged.<br>She stood up, and he stood up with her. She walked around the table, gave him a light, sweet kiss on the lips, then walked out of the restaurant. As she made her way through the tiny vestibule, one man flattened himself against the wall to let her pass, while another held the outside door open for her. Stone could see a cab waiting with the rear door standing open; she got into it and rode away down Second Avenue into what had become a blowing snowstorm.<br>The two men entered the restaurant and walked toward Stone. The taller of the two was Bill Eggers, his law school buddy and currently the managing partner of the prestigious law firm of Woodman &amp; Weld, to which Stone was of counsel, which meant that he was hired to handle the cases the firm did not wish to be seen to handle.<br>The other man was a stranger, shorter, heftier and squarer-shaped than Eggers. Stone did not know him but presumed he was the client Eggers wanted him to meet with.<br>&#x201c;Evening, Stone,&#x201d; Eggers said, shaking his hand. &#x201c;This is our client, Warren Keating.&#x201d;<br>Stone shook the man&#x2019;s hand and offered them both a chair. &#x201c;How do you do?&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Ordinarily I do very well,&#x201d; the man said, sitting down, &#x201c;but . . .&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Warren has a problem I think you can help him with,&#x201d; Eggers interrupted.<br>&#x201c;I hope so,&#x201d; Stone replied. &#x201c;Can I get you a drink?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Scotch,&#x201d; Keating replied quickly. &#x201c;Laphroaig, if they have it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Two,&#x201d; Eggers said.<br>&#x201c;They have it,&#x201d; Stone replied, lifting an eyebrow in the direction of a waiter, who scurried over and took their order.<br>&#x201c;And another for me,&#x201d; Stone said, tossing off the remainder of his bourbon.<br>Eggers looked sharply at Stone but didn&#x2019;t comment.<br>&#x201c;How can I help you, Mr. Keating?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Warren,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;I . . .&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you mind if I sum this up for you, Warren?&#x201d; Eggers said, interrupting again.<br>Stone reflected that Eggers did not interrupt clients without a good reason.<br>&#x201c;All right, Bill,&#x201d; Keating said wearily.<br>&#x201c;Warren runs a multigenerational family business,&#x201d; Eggers began.<br>&#x201c;Elijah Keating&#x2019;s Sons,&#x201d; Keating said. &#x201c;My great-grandfather started it when he got home from the Civil War.&#x201d;<br>Stone nodded, but he had never heard of it.<br>&#x201c;This is not what you would call a mom-and-pop business,&#x201d; Eggers continued. &#x201c;The company manufactures industrial equipment and tooling; they operate nineteen factories around the world.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve run out of Elijah Keating&#x2019;s sons,&#x201d; Keating said. &#x201c;My only son is the most recent generation, and he . . . has no interest in coming into the business. I&#x2019;m getting on, and I&#x2019;m weary of the travel involved in running a worldwide operation.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Warren has accepted an offer from a multinational company&#x2014;a very, very substantial offer.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Congratulations, Warren,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Keating replied. &#x201c;I need my son&#x2019;s consent.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Warren&#x2019;s great-grandfather&#x2019;s will was very specific,&#x201d; Eggers said. &#x201c;Each living heir must agree to a sale of the business.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My father has already signed off on the sale,&#x201d; Keating said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s old, and he was initially against it, but he&#x2019;s finally seen the wisdom of the sale.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; Stone replied. &#x201c;And your son hasn&#x2019;t consented?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t know about it,&#x201d; Keating replied. &#x201c;At least not to my knowledge.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Warren and his son have not been in touch in recent days,&#x201d; Eggers said.<br>Stone figured he was being diplomatic. &#x201c;I see,&#x201d; he replied, though he didn&#x2019;t.<br>Warren Keating reached into an inside pocket, produced a postcard and handed it to Stone. &#x201c;This is Evan&#x2019;s most recent communication,&#x201d; he said.<br>Stone perused the card. On one side was a photograph of a bar, labeled &#x201c;Sloppy Joe&#x2019;s, Key West.&#x201d; Stone turned it over and read the message, which was written in block capitals.<br>&#x201c;DEAR OLD DAD,&#x201d; it read, &#x201c;HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME, GLAD YOU&#x2019;RE NOT HERE. GO FUCK YOURSELF.&#x201d; It was signed with a flourish, &#x201c;Evan.&#x201d;<br>Stone returned the card, and Keating handed him a photograph. It was black-and-white, like something from a college yearbook, and featured a slim, handsome young man in a blue blazer, with close-cropped hair.<br>&#x201c;How old was he then, and how old is he now?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;He was nineteen or twenty then, and he&#x2019;s twenty-six now,&#x201d; Keating replied.<br>&#x201c;And how long is it since you&#x2019;ve seen him?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not since his graduation, and we&#x2014;his mother and I&#x2014;sort of missed him then. We made our way over to where his class was sitting, and there was just his cap and gown on a chair with his name on it. He had only recently come into a nice little trust fund from his mother&#x2019;s side of the family, which gave him a certain amount of freedom.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; Stone said, seeing for the first time. &#x201c;The postmark on the card was smudged; when did you receive it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Five days ago,&#x201d; Keating replied. &#x201c;I had heard he was in Miami, and when we started negotiating the sale of the business I sent a private investigator looking for him. He was contacted but rebuffed the investigator and disappeared from his hotel there. I took the, ah, tenor of his message on the card to mean that he did not wish to be contacted by me.&#x201d;<br>Stone nodded. &#x201c;I should think this is a job for a skip tracer, Bill,&#x201d; he said to Eggers.<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Eggers said, pulling a thick envelope from an inside pocket and handing it to Stone. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a job for an attorney. This is the form of consent to the sale; I wrote it myself. His great-great-grandfather&#x2019;s will requires that it be explained to him by an attorney and that he be given an opportunity to engage a lawyer of his own to review it. If he chooses not to have it reviewed, there&#x2019;s a second document to be signed, waiving that right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If you can get this done for me, Stone,&#x201d; Keating said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m prepared to be generous.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What sort of time frame are we talking about?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;A week, give or take,&#x201d; Eggers said.<br>&#x201c;And that postcard is the only reason to think he&#x2019;s in Key West?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>Keating shrugged. &#x201c;He could be anywhere.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave tomorrow morning,&#x201d; Stone said, glancing through the restaurant&#x2019;s front window. &#x201c;Weather permitting.&#x201d;</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>EGGERS AND KEATING had just left when Dino Bacchetti, Stone&#x2019;s former partner in his days on the NYPD, walked into Elaine&#x2019;s, shucking off and shaking his overcoat. Dino was still on the force, a lieutenant now running the detective squad at the 19th, the Upper East Side precinct.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming down out there,&#x201d; Dino said, hanging up his coat and taking a seat, while making drinking motions at a waiter, who was already in gear. He stopped and looked at Stone. &#x201c;You look like you&#x2019;ve just been dumped again.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Again? What&#x2019;s that supposed to mean?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re always getting dumped,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>&#x201c;I have to go to Key West tomorrow; you want to come along?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What about this weather?&#x201d; Dino asked.<br>&#x201c;The snowstorm is supposed to pass off the coast early in the morning, followed by clear weather.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Dino said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to take a trip to Key West in the dead of winter, and I&#x2019;ve got some time off coming.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re on,&#x201d; Stone said, sipping his drink and reaching for a menu.<br>Elaine got up from a nearby table, walked over and sat down. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;Tati dumped you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I knew it,&#x201d; Dino chimed in.<br>&#x201c;We had a conversation,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;It looked to me like she was doing all the talking,&#x201d; Elaine pointed out.<br>&#x201c;All right, all right; she&#x2019;s taking her husband back.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That ass?&#x201d; Dino said, incredulous. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a drunk, and he beat her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She says he&#x2019;s been sober for ninety-one days, and he&#x2019;s a changed man.&#x201d;<br>Elaine spoke up. &#x201c;When they have to count the days, they haven&#x2019;t changed yet. Sounds like he&#x2019;s in AA, though, and that can&#x2019;t be a bad thing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Forgive me if I view anything that would get him back into her house as a bad thing,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t heard the last of her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What kind of job did Bill Eggers stick you with?&#x201d; Elaine asked.<br>&#x201c;Actually, it&#x2019;s not so bad. Dino and I are flying to Key West tomorrow morning.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This is work?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This is work.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a lucky son of a bitch, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;Sometimes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Later,&#x201d; Elaine said, getting up to greet some regulars who had just wandered in.<br>&#x201c;So what is it we have to do down there?&#x201d; Dino asked. &#x201c;I take it we&#x2019;re not going to spend all our time on the beach.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I hate the beach,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hot and sandy and uncomfortable. Have you ever made love on a beach? Sand gets into everything, and I mean everything. Even your ears.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your ears?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Trust me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;ll have to. You know anybody in Key West?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I met a lawyer from there once, at a meeting in Atlanta, but I can&#x2019;t remember his name. Jack something, I think; nice guy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You remember Tommy Sculley, from the old days?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, he was a few years ahead of us on the squad.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He put in his thirty and retired down there a few years ago, but he couldn&#x2019;t stand it, so he got a job on the local force.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good. Let&#x2019;s look him up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t answer my question: What do we have to do down there?&#x201d;<br>Stone handed him the photograph. &#x201c;Find this kid.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What, he didn&#x2019;t come back from spring break last year?&#x201d;</p><p></p></p><h2>A Christmas Home: A Novel</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd McCray, hero of <i>A Dog Named Christmas</i>, is now twenty-four years old and working at a local animal shelter, where he meets and quickly becomes best friends with Laura, a young volunteer. Laura, like Todd, has disabilities of her own, but her struggles are more physical than developmental. Their friendship is sealed when Todd&#x2014;with the help of his trusted companion, the tenacious Labrador retriever named Christmas&#x2014;trains a beautiful dog named Gracie to help Laura with the day-to-day life tasks that are difficult for her. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life seems good for Todd, but all is not well in his hometown. Struggling families unable to make ends meet are abandoning more and more dogs, and the shelter is swelling to capacity. &nbsp;The local government is struggling to meet its obligations too, and in early December, on the cusp of another holiday season, Todd&#x2019;s boss delivers the bad news. &nbsp;Due to funding problems, the shelter will close its doors before the end of the year.&nbsp; But what will happen to all the animals?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Christmas holiday approaches, Todd has limited time to find homes for all the dogs. Not to mention that he needs to secure a new job and figure out what to do when his friendship with Laura takes an unexpected romantic turn. All this seems overwhelming unless you&#x2019;ve got a loving family, dedicated friends, and a couple of very special dogs behind you.&nbsp;In which case, nothing is impossible.</p><p><p>Greg Kincaid, author of <i>A Dog Named Christmas </i>and <i>Christmas with Tucker</i>, is a practicing lawyer who specializes in family law mediation. He is also an active advocate for literacy and for the humane treatment of animals. He helped to start the <i>Foster a Lonely Pet for the Holidays</i> program that has found homes for tens of thousands of shelter dogs. The father of five children, he lives<i> </i>on a farm in western Johnson County, Kansas, with his wife, two cats and two dogs.</p>Chapter 1<br><br>One Year Later<br><br>People would look at the old black Lab and say, "Christmas. That's an unusual name for a dog." In the beginning, George would explain how the Lab was supposed to have been a temporary holiday guest, a brief fostering project to help out the local animal shelter. His youngest son, Todd, thought the name Christmas was a good fit. Now, nearly four years later, the dog had found a permanent home with the McCray family, and George was inclined to lean down, hug his canine friend around the neck, and say, "Best Christmas present I ever got!"<br><br>Christmas was resting his head on Todd's lap in the backseat of the car as they drove down Main Street that evening. George's wife, Mary Ann, and Todd chatted back and forth about the weather--lightly falling snow, smoky gray skies, and a low howling northwest wind. George, a pragmatic sort, smiled at the notion, but wondered if they shouldn't have named the lab Elmer, like the glue. The dog bound and knitted his family together.<br><br>The elder McCray tried to park in the small municipal lot that flanked the west side of Crossing Trails Town Hall, but it was already jammed with cars. The turnout for that night's town hall meeting was going to be huge, particularly for a town of less than two thousand residents. So much was hanging in the balance.<br><br>George turned back onto Main Street and drove north for two more blocks before finding a space in front of what had been the barbershop but was now a Dollar General Store--a sign of the times. Though many older businesses like the hardware store and the diner had managed to hang on, the growing number of discount stores suggested that the town's better days were visible only in the rearview mirror. Once within this tiny six-block area they still called "downtown" there had been a bakery, a movie theater, clothing stores, a Ford dealership, a furniture shop, and much more. Still, the Crossing Trails Chamber of Commerce boasted thirty-four members. The town just had to survive, George thought. Right? Any other answer seemed inconceivable.<br><br>Many of the original stately brick buildings had survived, but there were also plenty of newer, cheaper-looking steel-and-concrete structures, quite a few sporting for rent or sale signs. George was continually amazed at the way the town had changed, particularly in the last several years as the exodus of young people from the rural farming community continued. At least his children, all living within driving distance, had not strayed too far from the McCray homestead. Todd was closest of all.<br><br>"Looks like a good turnout for the meeting," George observed.<br><br>"As it should be. People are worried." Mary Ann buttoned up her coat and collected her purse from the floor of the car. She turned around and poked at her son's knee. "Let's go."<br><br>Todd undid his seat belt and started to get out of the backseat with his headphones still attached and his iPod playing a Scotty McCreery tune that he did his best to adopt as his own. Once completely out of the car, he broke out with the chorus, "I love you this big!" As Todd stretched out his arms, Mary Ann stepped into his embrace, and they repeated the lyrics together. Mary Ann smiled at life. Being a music teacher and having a tone-deaf son was beyond ironic.<br><br>George opened the other rear passenger door. When Christmas jumped out, he snapped a leash on the dog's collar and gave him a gentle pat on the head. "Good boy. You've got work to do tonight, don't you?"<br>There was an unusual urgency to that night's town hall meeting. Earlier in the week The Prairie Star--Crossing Trail's newspaper, once daily, but now weekly--had reported that the mayor would discuss the town's latest economic setback. After fifty years, Midwest Trailer and Hitch had officially called it quits. Horse ownership was at an all-time low, as were trailer sales, and the town's largest employer was going out of business.<br><br>The survival of Crossing Trails was being threatened by a combination of factors that could be overcome only by an intense collaborative effort. Severe cost-cutting measures were inevitable, and everyone knew it. The lead story in The Prairie Star indicated that services that had once been taken for granted were now at risk. Like a virus at a day care, the rumors spread up and down Main Street in the close-knit town. People had moved right past worried and were dashing toward panicked.<br><br>The McCrays and other families had watched as smaller rural communities in the surrounding counties had eliminated or consolidated fire and police departments, closed schools and libraries, shut hospitals, and all but died. They couldn't help wondering if the same spiral had been set in motion in their town.<br><br>George, Todd, and Mary Ann walked south down Main Street as a light fog settled in. Christmas loitered, sniffing at the occasional fire hydrant. The outside temperature on this early December evening was warmer than the snow-covered ground. The slushy sidewalk was dangerously slick and uneven in places, so they walked carefully, with Todd in the middle, holding on to his parents' hands with a firm, youthful grip that kept them from slipping.<br><br>Mary Ann liked it that her adult son would still hold his parents' hands. For some it might be considered a sign of his disability, but for her it meant so much more. When he was little, he held her hand for physical support; when he was older, he did it for emotional reassurance. It was his way of checking to make sure that his mother was there for him as he navigated through a world that did not always make sense to him. Later still, holding his parents' hands became a simple and honest way to show his unabashed love. While his grip still sent some of these ancient family messages, it was not lost on her that there was something new going on. Todd was using his strength to hold them up. She wondered if George was having anywhere near the same thought, or if Todd had an inkling of how the roles of parent and child were constantly being renegotiated with the passage of time.<br><br>In the storefront windows many of the merchants had made some effort to showcase their Christmas goods. Green holly and blinking white lights hung from the wood poles and brass rings that previous generations had used to tie off their horses. Falling under the dim light, cast by the old-fashioned streetlights, were little bits of intermittent snow blowing through the dark night sky.<br><br>With his jet-black coat, Christmas was hard to see as he tagged along, content, with his family.<br><br>The dog was a local legend in Crossing Trails. It was hard to know where the truth about Christmas ended and the exaggeration began; both George and Todd were inclined to embellish his exploits. Whether Christmas had really taken on a mountain lion and won, understood more than fifty words, or could read your thoughts didn't matter to most people. What they loved most about the dog was the joy he brought to the McCray family and every other human he met. That was magic enough.<br><br>Both Todd and George described Christmas as "my dog." However convenient, this was not entirely accurate. Like blue skies, small children, and the air we breathe, dogs can be shared, loved, and enjoyed but not owned. Partnership, yes. Ownership, no. That's the way it has always been between dogs and humans.<br><br>The foursome entered the crowded meeting room of City Hall. Todd's boss at the shelter, Hayley Donaldson, had promised to save them seats near the back, where Christmas could rest out of the way before he went to work. The McCrays looked around but could not find Hayley, so they claimed four chairs at the back of the room and sat down.<br><br>Todd took the aisle seat and gave the command for Christmas to sit, out of the flow of traffic. He pulled an index card from his pocket with a list on it. Hayley loved lists. She was always giving him lists. Todd smiled to himself as he thought about the lists. He would often tease Hayley by greeting her with his hand extended. When she looked at him quizzically, he would say, "Waiting for my list!"<br><br>Earlier that day she had written on an index card the things she wanted him and Christmas to do at the town hall meeting. At times it irritated Todd that she made so many lists telling him to do things he didn't need her to tell him to do. When he complained about it to her, she just said, "I make lists for me, so what's wrong with making them for you?"<br><br>Todd stuffed the index card back in his pocket, and as he did a funny thought caused him to laugh out loud. Tomorrow he would make a list and give it to Hayley. It would say, "Quit making lists!"<br><br>George looked up at his son wondering why he was chuckling. "What's so amusing?"<br><br>Sometimes other people did not find the same things funny that Todd did, so he had slowly grown guarded about sharing his sense of humor--even with his mom and dad. He was afraid that it did not make him look smart. "I was just thinking about something at work."<br><br>George smiled reassuringly, picking up on Todd's reluctance to explain himself further. In fact, as someone who loved to laugh when he could, George very much enjoyed Todd's sense of humor and didn't care whether or not his son looked smart.<br><br>George returned his attention to the room. No one had bothered to plug the Christmas tree lights in on the mayor's Christmas tree. Fake gift boxes had been haphazardly spread about the base. All the faux gifts were wrapped in the same green paper, and most were ripped in several places. Many of the bows and ribbons had slipped off. George took one look at the pathetic tree, went over to the wall socket, and plugged in the lights. It looked only marginally better. He shrugged and returned to his seat between Todd and Mary Ann.<br><br>The McCrays spotted many familiar faces as more people began to stream into the increasingly crowded room; it seemed that most of the families they knew in Cherokee County were represented here tonight. This meeting had definitely captured everyone's attention. While George said his hellos to friends and neighbors, Mary Ann turned around and glanced at the entrance to watch the people coming in. Then she caught sight of a scene unfolding in the small glass-walled conference room across from the main meeting hall. She nudged George. "Look out there," she said softly.<br><br>Though they could not hear the conversation, it was obvious to the two of them that Hayley Donaldson was having a heated discussion with the mayor and the city manager. She was throwing her hands up in the air as if to say What gives? She was a tall, self-assured, and confident woman--fit and strong from handling dogs. "That looks bad," George said quietly, while thinking to himself that he wouldn't want to be on the receiving end in a heated exchange with that young lady.<br><br>Todd, oblivious to the scene, pulled Christmas close to him and checked his pockets to make sure he had remembered the training treats. That was number four on Hayley's list. He grinned again.<br><br>The door to the conference room flew open and Hayley stepped out into the hall that separated the smaller room from the main hall. She saw the McCray family in the last row and moved quickly toward them, greeting Todd and Christmas briefly before taking the seat next to Mary Ann, who sensed her distress the moment she saw her. "I'm so darn mad, I can't talk," she whispered to Mary Ann. She continued to glare out into space, and soon angry tears began to stream down her cheeks.<br><br>Mary Ann took her by the arm. "Hayley, what's wrong?"<br><br>In high school Hayley had been one of Mary Ann's favorite students, in every way a responsible and dedicated young woman. She had been one of the stars on the debate team and had never lost her composure easily. Mary Ann tended to remain protective of her former students. She tried again, "What happened? Tell me."<br><br>"You're not going to believe this. I can't believe it."<br><br>"What?" Mary Ann pleaded.<br><br>Hayley nodded her head in Todd's direction and then leaned over to whisper in her favorite teacher's ear, "They want to close the shelter. Like, now."<br><br>"No!" Mary Ann gasped. She could not help her own reaction but didn't want Todd to overhear. "Come with me," she said, standing. Todd and George looked up as the two women stepped into the aisle. Mary Ann clutched Hayley's elbow and said, "Just a quick trip to the ladies' room before this meeting starts." George looked at Mary Ann and nodded, knowing full well that something else was going on.<br><br>Once in the hallway, struggling to keep her voice even, Mary Ann continued, "Why in the world would they do that?"<br><br>Hayley spoke softly and tried to sum up her conversation with the mayor. "As usual: it's all about money. The county is no longer willing to fund its half of the shelter's expenses. The town has its own money problems. Mayor McDaniel told me that they want us to close. We're done."<br><br>Mary Ann's voice rose uncontrollably. "That's impossible. Where will the dogs go?"<br><br>Several people milling in the hallway began to notice their conversation. Hayley led Mary Ann a few steps farther away from the meeting room and continued her explanation. "Mayor McDaniel may know something about real estate, but she doesn't know squat about animal shelters. She must think that we can put fifty-plus dogs and cats on the corner and someone will just pick them up. I had to scream at her just so she would agree to let us stay open till the end of the year."<br><br>"Why is the county backing out?" Mary Ann asked.<br><br>"The shelter needs lots of repairs. The roof, the plumbing, the heating, and the air-conditioning are all old."<br><br>"So why can't they just fix it?"<br><br>"They needed the money for other things, so they sold our building. We have to vacate by December 31. They are going to demolish the shelter to make room for a convenience store! I'm just so mad I can't stand it!"<br><br>Mary Ann looked toward the meeting room. "Does Todd know?"<br><br>"No. I just found out myself."<br><br>"They gave you no warning?"<br><br>"A couple of months ago, and then again several weeks ago, the city manager told me that there were money problems and problems with our lease, too." Hayley again started to choke on her words. "They never told me this could happen. I thought they would work it out. I just didn't take the whole thing seriously." She calmed herself. "I should have seen it coming."</p><h2>Revolutions in the Atlantic World: A Comparative History</h2><p><p>In the late eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, revolutions transformed the British, French, and Spanish Atlantic worlds. During this time, colonial and indigenous people rioted and rebelled against their occupiers in violent pursuit of political liberty and economic opportunity, challenging time-honored social and political structures on both sides of the Atlantic. As a result, mainland America separated from British and Spanish rule, the French monarchy toppled, and the world&#x2019;s wealthiest colony was emancipated. In the new sovereign states, legal equality was introduced, republicanism embraced, and the people began to question the legitimacy of slavery.</p><p><b>Revolutions in the Atlantic World</b> wields a comparative lens to reveal several central themes in the field of Atlantic history, from the concept of European empire and the murky position it occupied between the Old and New Worlds to slavery and diasporas. How was the stability of the old regimes undermined? Which mechanisms of successful popular mobilization can be observed? What roles did blacks and Indians play?

In 1943, Benuzzi and two fellow Italian prisoners of war escaped from a British camp in equatorial East Africa with one goal--to climb the seventeen-thousand-foot Mount Kenya. Filled with suspense and humor, it is an extraordinary story that has earned its place as a masterpiece.</p><p>Ethiopia, 1941. Felice Benuzzi was a junior officer in the Italian Colonial Service, stationed in Addis Ababa, when the British thwarted Mussolini's ambition to build a colonial empire in East Africa. Benuzzi, along with thousands of other Italians, was captured and interned in a POW camp near the foot of Mount Kenya, where he and his countrymen languished indefinitely, waiting out the war and the desperate boredom, passivity, and isolation of prison life. "In order to break the monotony," he writes, "one had only to start taking risks again." But the isolation of the camp precluded the possibility of escape to a neutral country: "I thought, then at least I shall stage a break in this awful travesty of life. I shall try to get out, climb Mount Kenya and return here." So begins <i>No Picnic on Mount Kenya</i>, a first-class adventure story full of courage, humor, and exquisite detail. <p> Benuzzi and two fellow prisoners spent six months secretly hoarding food; sewing clothing, shoes, and tents; and scavenging for scrap metal to hammer into ice axes and crampons. After escaping, they braved the multiple risks of capture, wild animals (including elephants and rhinoceros), starvation, frigid weather, and some of the most challenging climbing conditions in Africa. The men ascended 16,300 feet to Mount Kenya's Point Lenana, hoisted a homemade flag, and then returned to the misery of the camp. Benuzzi and his comrades never cared that their freedom was fleeting: they climbed Mount Kenya to reaffirm their humanity in the face of a barbaric world war. The gallantry of this gesture sets <i>No Picnic</i> apart from typical mountaineering stories of risk and self reliance. <i>--Svenja Soldovieri</i></p>In 1943, Felice Benuzzi and two Italian compatriots escaped from a British POW camp in equatorial East Africa with only one goal in mind - to climb the dangerous seventeen-thousand-foot Mount Kenya. No Picnic on Mount Kenya is the classic tale of this most bizarre and thrilling adventure, a story that has earned its place as a unique masterpiece of daring and suspense.

He is one of the most amazing, popular, and iconic characters in the history of motion pictures. His 1933 debut was a legendary piece of pure cinema simultaneously a terrifying monster movie, epic fairy tale, tragic love story, and deeply resonant cultural myth. His name is King Kong. Ray Morton&#39;s King Kong The History of a Movie Icon is the first book to chronicle the making of all seven feature films in which the character of Kong has appeared, including the hotly anticipated Peter Jackson version. It is generously illustrated with photographs, production art, and promotional materials from the author&#39;s extensive private collection. Morton has interviewed the surviving members of each major film. A colorful overview of the tremendous amount of collectible Kong merchandise is also on view for all the fans of Kongdom to devour.</p><p>Ray Morton has worked in Hollywood for the past fifteen years as a writer, script consultant, and story analyst.<i>Script</i> magazine columnist Morton, who views <i>King Kong</i> as "an enduring cultural icon," was captivated at age eight by the giant gorilla, and his "<i>Kong</i>-mania went into overdrive" with the 1976 Dino De Laurentiis version. In an effort to survey all feature films in which Kong appears, Morton interviewed surviving cast and crew members, visited archives and trekked to film locations, documenting everything from ape suits, budget woes and optical effects to "Kongs That Never Were." The lengthy opening chapter recaps the making of the 1933 film in exhaustive detail, illustrated with dramatic conceptual art and test shots; an equal amount of space is given to the 1976 remake. Shorter chapters review "The Son of Kong," "King Kong vs. Godzilla," "King Kong Escapes" and "King Kong Lives." Peter Jackson's forthcoming version gets only 14 pages, but fans dazzled by this book's 100 color and b&amp;w illustrations (storyboards, stills, production art, collectibles) and comprehensive coverage of past Kongs won't complain. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Am�lie Rives, from a Southern family and the goddaughter of Robert E. Lee, was a daring author, a stunning temptress, and a woman ahead of her time. Filled with glamour, mystery, and madness, their love affair and marriage made them the talk of society in the Gilded Age. <br><br>Archie and Am�lie seemed made for each other&#x2014;both were passionate, intense, and driven by emotion&#x2014;but the very things that brought them together would soon draw them apart. Their marriage began with a &#x201c;secret&#x201d; wedding that found its way onto the front page of the <i>New York Times</i>, to the dismay of Archie&#x2019;s relatives and Am�lie&#x2019;s many gentleman friends.

I was inclined to dismiss all of this as tall tales Virginians love to spin out; but when I looked into these yarns I found proof that they were true. . . .&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Donna M.

She lives with her husband and son in Charlottesville, Virginia, where the story of Archie and Am�lie is part of local lore.Chapter One<br><br>The Education of an Astor, <i>or A Name That Rings Like Bullion</i><br><br>The irony of Archie&#x2013;man on the run, hiding his face as he crossed the familiar Manhattan precincts of his youth&#x2013;was not lost on the Astor heir himself. He had been, and still considered himself, one of the princes of the city. In fact, much of the real estate he traversed during that hansom cab ride in 1900 was owned by his family.<br><br>The story of the Astor wealth was legend, and Archie could recite it chapter and verse. He had been schooled in the family history and in the expectations that it created. Archie understood only too well the burden involved. As the eldest son in his huge family (he had seven surviving brothers and sisters), he carried a particularly heavy load. All of the Chanler siblings prided themselves on their individuality, on their strong-willed and often eccentric ways. They all professed an indifference to money. Why not? They had plenty of it. Piles of it had been amassed by their forebears, and none of the current generation&#x2013;least of all Archie&#x2013;wanted to spend their lives the way their great-grandfather William Backhouse Astor had.<br><br>Nicknamed &#x201c;Landlord of New York,&#x201d;William Backhouse Astor was both reviled and envied in his lifetime. Hewas a &#x201c;hard dreary looking old man and the richest in the world,&#x201d; in the estimation of Lord Rosebery, the future prime minister of England. Six feet tall but stoopshouldered, William B. Astor spent his life hunched over his contracts and leases. He had inherited from his father, John Jacob Astor, vast stretches of Manhattan real estate, and as the population boomed in nineteenth-century New York, the value of the land rose exponentially. By 1860 tenement slums with a population density of 290,000 per square mile became William B. Astor&#x2019;s specialty. The arithmetic was simple: one block filled with tenements could generate at least twice the revenue of a similar block with more-spacious middle-class housing. As immigrants poured into the city, the Astor name became synonymous with misery. When one newcomer proudly announced to a Board of Health inspector that his house was owned by Astor, the official shot back, &#x201c;More&#x2019;s the pity.&#x201d;<br><br>William B. was the caretaker for the vast empire his father had acquired; he had little interest in building or transforming the landscape. He would just as soon let others erect housing for the poor on his land; he would merely collect the rents. Being a pious man, he could then blame others for&#x2013;or claim ignorance of&#x2013;the inhumane conditions that prevailed on his property. But of course his ignorance of conditions only went so far. Eager to maintain the status quo and keep his coffers full, he did his best to defy all attempts at tenement reform and for years succeeded in delaying the construction of subways that would allow immigrants to live in more distant parts of the city. Besides, in his view, it was laziness that kept a man in a miserable tenement with no ventilation, plumbing, or light. It was not William B.&#x2019;s problem. One had only to look at his father&#x2019;s example to see the opportunity available to any man willing to work hard&#x2013;a belief commonly held by William B. and other plutocrats who had inherited vast fortunes without lifting a finger.<br><br>Archie knew as well of the more colorful saga of his great-greatgrandfather, who had amassed the original fortune. The family patriarch&#x2019;s saga was indeed impressive. As legend has it, John Jacob Astor, twenty-year-old son of a poor butcher in Waldorf, Germany, arrived in Baltimore in 1784 with seven flutes and about five pounds sterling, and parlayed it into a fortune conservatively estimated at $20 million, a sum that staggered the imagination of his contemporaries. In 1848, the year Astor died, the richest man in Boston left behind only $2 million. John Jacob&#x2019;s winter passage to America was in steerage, and he subsisted on salt beef, biscuits, and dreams of what lay ahead. Just short of Baltimore the ship became trapped in ice, and there it remained stranded for two months&#x2013;enough time for Astor to hatch a plan. One of his fellow German passengers was in the fur trade, and he passed the time by telling stories of the fortunes that could be made by buying American furs for next to nothing and selling them in England for exorbitant prices.<br><br>Astor&#x2019;s course was set. Arriving in New York, he went to work for a furrier, and spent the following summer beating pelts to keep moths out of them. Astor became a keen student of the fur business, and within several years had set up his own shop. Shouldering a backpack stuffed with at least sixty pounds of trade items, he tramped hundreds of miles through the wilderness, struck tough bargains with the trappers, and then brought the pelts to London, where he sold them at great profit. One beaver pelt in London might bring the equivalent of three dollars&#x2013;the same price as a musket, which Astor could then trade with an Indian for ten more beaver skins.<br><br>While in London, Astor cemented a deal with the firm of Astor and Broadwood (his older brother was a partner in the company), manufacturers of musical instruments. He served as New York agent for their pianos, flutes, and violins&#x2013;valued and scarce commodities in New York&#x2013;and, in the process, helped finance his burgeoning fur business. He opened a small shop in Manhattan that bore the unusual sign furs and pianos. One of John Jacob&#x2019;s original pianos remains at Rokeby, a reminder of the Astor patriarch&#x2019;s early strivings in commerce.<br><br>As his business grew, so did John Jacob&#x2019;s ambition. He leaped into the China trade, eventually sending his own fleet of ships to Canton, where furs could be bartered for tea, silk, and porcelain. With a ruthlessness and cunning that would be admired&#x2013;and copied&#x2013;by later robber barons, Astor turned his American Fur Company into the country&#x2019;s first great monopoly. Other successful merchants and financiers would hang paintings in their offices to display their refined taste; Astor preferred to hang a fine fur in his counting room, which he would stroke and boast of its worth in China.<br><br>As he piled up more and more money, John Jacob turned his eye toward investing it. All he had to do was look around and see the changes that had transformed Manhattan. When he had arrived in New York in 1784, the city&#x2019;s 23,000 residents lived largely below Cortlandt Street, at the southern tip of the island. By 1800 the population had more than doubled, and buildings had sprouted nearly a mile farther north. Betting that the city would continue that constant move northward, Astor began buying up property just beyond the built-up sections of the city. It was the future he was buying. In around 1810, John Jacob sold a lot near Wall Street for $8,000. The purchaser was certain that he had just fleeced Astor. Gloating, the new owner said, &#x201c;Why, Mr. Astor, in a few years this lot will be worth twelve thousand dollars.&#x201d; &#x201c;Very true,&#x201d; Astor replied, &#x201c;but now you shall see what I will do with this money. With eight thousand dollars I buy eighty lots above Canal Street. By the time your lot is worth twelve thousand dollars my eighty lots will be worth eighty thousand dollars.&#x201d; And he was right.<br><br>Astor&#x2019;s real estate holdings made him as rich as Croesus, his very name conjuring up lucre. &#x201c;John Jacob Astor,&#x201d; the narrator of Herman Melville&#x2019;s &#x201c;Bartleby the Scrivener&#x201d; opined, &#x201c;[is] a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion.&#x201d; The newly minted millionaire was disdained for his peasant aura, his heavily accented and grammatically fractured English, and his alarming table manners. In 1815, James Gallatin noted in his diary that the fur peddler had dined at their home and &#x201c;ate his ice-cream and peas with a knife&#x201d;&#x2013;reason enough for his father, the patrician Jeffersonian statesman, Albert Gallatin, to decline Astor&#x2019;s offer of a partnership in the American Fur Company. Five years later, John Jacob once more discomfited the Gallatins, by dining at their home and wiping his dirty fingers on their daughter&#x2019;s white sleeve.<br><br>Like a character out of Dickens, the richer Astor grew, the more miserly he became. &#x201c;I used to know him, when an ignoble dealer in Musk Rat skins,&#x201d; James Kirke Paulding, novelist of old Knickerbocker society, wrote contemptuously, &#x201c;but cut his acquaintance when he became a Millionaire, for found he grew mean faster than he grew rich, and that his avarice increased with his means of being generous. He lived miserably and died miserably.&#x201d; Stories of his mean-spiritedness were legion. This &#x201c;monarch of the counting-room&#x201d; was tarnished by his greed, according to a scathing biographical sketch of the millionaire in the February 1865 edition of <i>Harper&#x2019;s New Monthly Magazine: </i>&#x201c;The roll-book of his possessions was his Bible. He scanned it fondly and saw with quiet but deep delight the catalogue of his property lengthening from month to month. The love of accumulation grew with his years until it ruled him like a tyrant. If at fifty he possessed his millions, at sixty-five his millions possessed him.&#x201d;<br><br>Though he was reputed to &#x201c;now and then, bestow small sums in charity,&#x201d; the magazine claimed that &#x201c;we have failed to get trustworthy evidence of a single instance of his doing so.&#x201d; In his final years, however, he was talked into leaving behind a gift to the city that had made him rich: a library open to the public. Though the nuances of the English language eluded him, Astor was particularly fascinated by literary men, and in his semi-retirement years he frequently entertained writers and poets in his home. He befriended Washington Irving and chose him as one of the executors of his estate; he also employed the poet Fitz-Greene Halleck as his p...</p><h2>The Black Company Goes South</h2><p>After the Black Company has taken care of the Dominator in the north, the few survivors choose to go south to find out the real history of the Black Company and to find fabled Kathovar, the origin of the Black Company itself.

This is a fitting final chapter in the life of one of America&#39;s greatest men.<p>Dumas Malone, 1892&#x2013;1986, spent thirty-eight years researching and writing <i>Jefferson and His Time.</i> In 1975 he received the Pulitzer Prize in history for the first five volumes. From 1923 to 1929 he taught at the University of Virginia; he left there to join the <i>Dictionary of American Biography, </i>bringing that work to completion as editor-in-chief. Subsequently, he served for seven years as director of the Harvard University Press. After serving on the faculties of Yale and Columbia, Malone retired to the University of Virginia in 1959 as the Jefferson Foundation Professor of History, a position he held until his retirement in 1962. He remained at the university as biographer-in-residence and finished his Jefferson biography at the University of Virginia, where it was begun.</p></p><h2>We Didn&#39;t Mean to Go to Sea</h2><p>In this latest adventure (following Pigeon Post, winner of the Carnegie Medal), the Walker family has come to Harwich to wait for Commander Walker&#x2019;s return.

That&#x2019;s because my initial view of him was through the eyes of my previous subject, the late Chief Justice Earl Warren. Although Ike appointed Warren, it seemed to the chief justice, as it did to many Americans, that Ike was a benign but disengaged leader, unmoved by the call for civil rights, content to let the nation float on a tide of peaceful prosperity. <p>So even though my editor, the great Phyllis Grann, was persuaded that Ike would stand up to hard scrutiny, I had my doubts. It was with that ambivalence that, in early 2007, I arrived in Abilene, Kansas, home of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum, unsure where immersion in Eisenhower&#x2019;s presidential legacy would lead.</p> <p>There, in Ike&#x2019;s hometown, surrounded by his voluminous papers, I came around. For what those papers capture is a blend of military acumen, diplomatic subtlety and presidential leadership rivaled in American history only by George Washington.</p> <p>John Eisenhower, Ike&#x2019;s perceptive son, crisply described his father to me one morning in 2010. &#x201c;My dad,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;was not a social reformer. He was a commander-in-chief.&#x201d; Indeed, he was. Shrewd and patient, moderate and confident, Ike guided America through some of the most treacherous moments of the Cold War. He was urged to take advantage of America&#x2019;s military advantage in those early years &#x2013; to finish the Korean War with nuclear weapons, to repel Chinese aggression against Taiwan, to repulse the Soviets in Berlin, to rescue the French garrison at Dien Bien Phu. Eisenhower was not complacent--he authorized the overthrow of Mossadegh in Iran and Arbenz in Guatemala and welcomed the executions of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg--but nor was he reckless or unhinged.</p> <p>Eisenhower was a terrific poker player, and he played his cards carefully, mindful of the stakes: After ending the Korean War early in his presidency, Eisenhower jousted with the Soviets and Chinese in conflicts across the globe. During those many confrontations across more than seven years, just one American died in combat. That respite brought profound rewards. Eisenhower believed that time favored America in the Cold War, that the West would prevail by virtue of its values. He adamantly rejected Joe McCarthy&#x2019;s hysterical assault on American civil liberties and helped bring an end to McCarthyism (&#x201c;McCarthywasm,&#x201d; as Ike joked).</p> <p>Ike&#x2019;s leadership is thoroughly vindicated by time. His willingness to appoint and defer to capable subordinates allowed his civil rights record (highlighted by the appointments of Warren and Justice William Brennan, passage of the 1957 Civil Rights Act and the intervention in Little Rock) to exceed his instincts; his determination to build created the highway system and the St. Lawrence Seaway; his warning of the &#x201c;military industrial complex&#x201d; only grows more meaningful with experience. And his fixed pursuit of an unyielding and yet restrained response to communism not only lit the way for victory in the Cold War but also suggests a course for today&#x2019;s leaders confronted with the challenges of terrorism.</p> <p>It is a legacy of principled moderation and commitment to progress--one worthy of appreciation at a time when those virtues are in perilously short supply.</p> <p></p><p><b>JIM NEWTON</b>&nbsp;is a veteran journalist who began his career as clerk to James Reston at the <i>New York Times</i>.

In the ensuing manhunt, Tamerlan Tsarnaev died, and his younger brother, Dzhokhar, was captured and ultimately charged on thirty federal counts. Yet long after the bombings and the terror they sowed, after all the testimony and debate, what we still haven&#x2019;t learned is why. Why did the American Dream go so wrong for two immigrants? How did such a nightmare come to pass?<br><br>Acclaimed Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen is uniquely endowed with the background, access, and talents to tell the full story. An immigrant herself, who came to the Boston area with her family as a teenager, she returned to the former Soviet Union in her early twenties and covered firsthand the transformations that were wracking her homeland and its neighboring regions. It is there that the history of the Tsarnaev brothers truly begins, as descendants of ethnic Chechens deported to Central Asia in the Stalin era. Gessen follows the family in their futile attempts to make a life for themselves in one war-torn locale after another and then, as new �migr�s, in the looking-glass, utterly disorienting world of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Most crucially, she reconstructs the struggle between assimilation and alienation that ensued for each of the brothers, incubating a deadly sense of mission. And she traces how such a split in identity can fuel the metamorphosis into a new breed of homegrown terrorist, with feet on American soil but sense of self elsewhere.</p><p><b>Masha Gessen </b>is a Russian-American journalist who is the author of several books, most recently the national bestseller The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin (Riverhead, 2012) and Words Will Break Cement: The Passion of Pussy Riot (Riverhead, 2014).&nbsp; Her work has appeared in&nbsp; the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, The New York Times, &nbsp;The New York Review of Books, Slate, and many other&nbsp;publications, and has received numerous awards, most recently the 2013 Media for Liberty Award.

It is the spring of 2013. The billboards picture, by way of argument, the recently appointed head of Dagestan, Ramazan Abdulatipov, speaking with Russia&#x2019;s president, Vladimir Putin. Both look unhappy, but the photo op, apparently a one-time occurrence, seems not to have generated a better option.</p><p>The highway to the capital, like so much of Dagestan, is an object of pride and an embarrassment at the same time. It was built recently, and well; it is by far the best road in Dagestan, so good that at night young men race their souped-up Lada Priora sedans here. The Lada Priora is a bad, Russian-made car, but its twentieth-century technology lends itself to quick fixes. Which is a good thing, because as the road enters the city, turning into the main avenue, the smooth surface gives way to potholes that can cost you your tire or your life.</p><p>Outside the city, the highway is lined with unfinished houses, scores of them. They betray modest ambition&#x2014;small two-story structures along a highway&#x2014;and yet even this dream has gone unfulfilled. Rectangular openings stare at the highway where windows should be. Cows graze in between these carcasses and wander lazily onto the highway.</p><p>People you meet in Dagestan will tell you where else they have been. They have rarely ventured very far, but they have invariably found any other place to be remarkably different. Several drivers tell me that in Moscow or Saint Petersburg or even provincial Astrakhan, three hundred miles to the north of Makhachkala, people do not drive into natural-gas fueling stations (almost everyone in Dagestan seems to drive a car retrofitted for natural gas) with a lit cigarette in their mouths. In Astrakhan, one man tells me, they get all the passengers out of the car before refueling. This kind of regard for human life awes and baffles him. Astrakhan is no hub of bourgeois humanitarianism, but then, compared with Dagestan, almost anyplace is.</p><p>The Russian Federation includes eighty-three nominally self-governing regions, districts, autonomies, and republics; the republics differ from the rest of the convoluted federation&#x2019;s members in that they have the right to choose their own state language&#x2014;mostly because the republics are, by and large, populated by non-Russian ethnic groups. Dagestan, a republic, sits on the edge of the Russian empire, a mere two and a half hours by plane south-southeast from Moscow but as culturally remote as the far northeast, where Russia borders the United States, or the far east, where it seeps into China. Dagestan borders Azerbaijan and Georgia to the south and war-torn Chechnya to the north. Throughout its history as a part of Russia, Dagestan has been one of the poorest parts of the empire, and one of the most embattled. It has also always been the most diverse, with dozens of distinct ethnic groups living in various states of war and peace. Each group has a fiercely defined identity, but no single ethnic group claims the region as an ersatz nation-state, and a Dagestani identity per se can hardly be said to exist. So the billboards seem to be calling on people to take pride simply in living in Dagestan. But why would anyone want to live here?</p><p>This is where the story begins.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>FIRST, Zubeidat ran from Makhachkala. In May 1985, she was walking in the outskirts of Novosibirsk, terrified of getting into trouble, though most people back home would have said she was asking for trouble just by being in Novosibirsk. She had graduated from high school in Makhachkala a year earlier, and she wanted to go to college. Worse, she wanted to go to Moscow. One of her older brothers lived there, and from what she could tell, this brother was an important person. He worked in retail, which in the Soviet Union meant access to all sorts of nice things and influential people, and she had kept calling him, begging him to take her out of Makhachkala.</p><p>Makhachkala is a hard place to love. In the 2010s, a pair of journalists who set out to compile an oral history of the city, a coffee-table book with lots of nostalgic sepia-colored photographs, were repeatedly told by the residents they interviewed how unlivable Makhachkala had always been, what a misunderstanding of a city it was. A locally prominent artist called it &#x201c;a town without a legend&#x201d; that was &#x201c;unsuited for normal life.&#x201d; A fort reconstituted as a town in the mid&#x2013;nineteenth century, it felt like a haphazard and temporary agglomeration of more than a hundred ethnic groups, each of which maintained its own language and used variously simplified and mangled Russian to communicate with one another and the outside world. Streets bore the names of the ethnic groups that had originally settled there: Armenian Street crossed Persian Street. Soviet authorities renamed the streets in the spirit of internationalism and Communist ideology, but the old designations remained in the vernacular. Each group made its own living arrangements, usually unaided by the Communist state that had assumed the obligation for sheltering and feeding all citizens but failed consistently, and failed worse the farther from the center the citizens resided. People lived in barracks, in rehabbed fort structures, in sheds and other temporary dwellings, and well into the late twentieth century, indoor plumbing and cooking facilities remained the stuff of dreams.</p><p>Neighborhood borders were inviolate: a male outsider who tried to date a neighborhood girl would be knifed. The single unifying culture of the city was that of the prison. There were eight prison camps within the city limits before Stalin&#x2019;s death in 1953; once released, many of the inmates stayed on in the city. In at least one case, a camp was abolished and the barbed-wire fence removed, but the barracks were simply renamed &#x201c;dormitories&#x201d; and everybody stayed. The city jail, which never stopped functioning, sat up on a hill, a major landmark and the center of the switchblade-making industry. Every Makhachkala-born male past the age of puberty had to own a switchblade that had been smuggled out of the jail and sold on the black market.</p><p>Not that there was much of a legal economy: centrally distributed consumer goods rarely reached Russia&#x2019;s southern edge. Makhachkalinians wore clothes and shoes made by local tailors and cobblers&#x2014;there was one of each on nearly every block&#x2014;and ate fish caught in the Caspian Sea by local poachers, who went door-to-door every day hawking sturgeon and black-backed herring so fatty it could be tossed into a skillet with no oil. Yet the Caspian itself seemed to have no place in the city, or in any story about it. A gentle, light blue sea that is actually the world&#x2019;s largest lake, the Caspian was cut off from Makhachkala by a railroad constructed at the turn of the twentieth century. Only a thin strip of sand, barely a hundred yards at its narrowest, separated the water from the rails. The sounds of the railroad drowned out the murmur of the sea, and the bitter smell of tar, the metallic smell of hot rails, and the smoke of the engines overwhelmed the Caspian&#x2019;s softly salty air.</p><p>Whether people lived in nineteenth-century stone buildings or twentieth-century wooden barracks, they dwelled a family to a room if they were lucky, and used the courtyards for all their daily needs: wood-burning stoves for cooking, wooden outhouses never far away. At night young men went yard to yard, scooping human waste into large barrels mounted on their horse-driven carts, nicknamed &#x201c;stinkies.&#x201d; Household waste flowed in open trenches along city streets until the 1960s, when, legend has it, old gravestones were used to enclose the trenches in the city center&#x2014;there are still residents who claim to have seen Arabic writing beneath their feet.</p><p>Dwellings with indoor conveniences came in the 1960s, too, but in 1970 an earthquake measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale shook Dagestan. The epicenter was less than twenty miles west of Makhachkala. Thirty-one people died and half the city&#x2019;s population was left homeless. Twenty-two villages outside the city were completely destroyed, and their residents, too, flooded into Makhachkala even as more than a thousand aftershocks, some of them nearly as strong as the original quake, shook the city over the following six weeks. Makhachkala returned to the premodern state to which it seemed doomed.</p><p>A year later, the newly underequipped and overcrowded city was hit by a cholera epidemic. Moscow shut Makhachkala down: anyone who wanted to leave the city had to be tested for the germ and was not allowed to travel until cleared. The city&#x2019;s population swelled further with those waiting to travel out of Dagestan.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>ZUBEIDAT WAS BORN in Makhachkala three years before the earthquake. By the time she was a teenager, she was acutely and painfully aware of living in a backwater. Even the Chechens, who lived right next door and had been decimated by forced exile, had a real city: Grozny had fashion and music. It was from Grozny that young men would bring records and reel-to-reel tapes for Makhachkala&#x2019;s first <i>diskoteka</i>s&#x2014;a fancy word for dances&#x2014;in the early 1980s. To create disco lighting, the young men stole colored glass from traffic lights and, at great peril to themselves, flashing lights off police cars. In Grozny, young men were not too timid to wear pointy cowboy boots, which had roared into fashion; Makhachkalinians, who did not dare wear them, called them <i>nokhchi</i>-boots, or Chechen-boots. Men in Makhachkala still wore visored hats nicknamed &#x201c;airport caps&#x201d; for the exceedingly large flat surface they created on the wearer&#x2019;s head. Elsewhere in the Soviet Union these caps marked men as hailing from the remote Caucasian provinces, but in Dagestan they were privileged as city wear: country folk wore fluffy white sheepskin hats. The possession most coveted by any young person who wanted to escape Makhachkala&#x2019;s provincial uniformity was a white plastic bag printed with a full-color photograph of a man&#x2019;s behind in Wrangler jeans. These cost up to five rubles on the black market; a loaf of bread ran sixteen kopecks, or just over three percent of the price of the plastic bag.</p><p>Everyone in Makhachkala knew everything about everyone else. There was o...</p></p><h2>Modern Algebra and Trigonometry (Book 2) Structure and Method</h2><p>Classic modern algebra and trig book</p><p></p><h2>Jane Welsh Carlyle and Her Victorian World: A Story of Love, Work, Marriage, and Friendship</h2><p>Hailed by Virginia Woolf as one of the all-time great letter writers, Jane Welsh Carlyle, wife of Victorian literary celebrity Thomas Carlyle, has been much overlooked. In this compelling new biography, Kathy Chamberlain brings Jane out of her husband&#x2019;s shadow, focusing on Carlyle as a remarkable woman and writer in her own right.Caught between her own literary aspirations and Victorian society&#x2019;s oppression of women, Jane Welsh Carlyle hoped to move beyond domestic life and become a respected published writer. As she and her husband moved in exclusive London literary circles, mingling with noted authors, poets, and European revolutionaries, Carlyle created and reported to her correspondents on her rich, rewarding life in her Chelsea home&#x2015;until her husband&#x2019;s infatuation with a wealthy, imposing aristocratic society hostess threw her life into chaos.Through dedicated research and unparalleled access to Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x2019;s private correspondence, Kathy Chamberlain presents an elegant portrait of an extraordinary woman writer.</p><p>Kathy Chamberlain taught English for over thirty years at the City University of New York. She has given lectures on Jane Welsh Carlyle at the CUNY Graduate Center and at conferences in the US and UK, and has published numerous essays about Virginia Woolf and Jane Welsh Carlyle.&#x201c;This compelling portrait of&nbsp;Jane&nbsp;Carlyle, the wife of the essayist Thomas&nbsp;Carlyle, illuminates the outwardly decorous but often inwardly tempestuous lives of Victorian women.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Chamberlain, Jane's latest and incomparably best biographer . . . gives us, at last, a Jane Carlyle who seems thrillingly alive.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Christian Science Monitor</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A delightful book about the early stirrings of feminism in Victorian England and a celebration of the lost art of letter writing.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Hugely satisfying . . . such a happy read . . .

The Ultimate Program For Eating Well, Feeling Great, And Living Longer</h2><p><p>The Christian market is flooded with diet and exercise programs, each claiming to be "God's way" to healthy living. While some of them are based on biblical principles, and some have even proven effective for weight loss, there is not one program leading the pack daring to answer the question <i>What Would Jesus Do?</i> Or better yet, <i>What Would Jesus Eat?</i></p><p>This comprehensive eating plan examines Scripture and reveals what we <i>know</i> Jesus ate and what we can confidently infer He ate. Using current medical research, <i>What Would Jesus Eat?</i> demonstrates why the diet Jesus followed is ideal for twenty-first century living as well. Readers will:</p><li> Understand why foods forbidden in the Old Testament dietary laws are unhealthy for us.</li><li> Learn how to follow Jesus' eating model with foods that are available today</li><li> Realize the health benefits of the food Jesus ate and the health risks of the food He avoided.</li><p>The second half of the book equips the reader with tools to effectively follow the plan -- recipes, nutritional information, and practical advice.</p><p>For those desiring to safely lose weight and for those seeking a healthier, Bible-based eating program, the only question to ask is, <i>What Would Jesus Eat?</i></p></p><p>In <i>What Would Jesus Eat? The Ultimate Program for Eating Well, Feeling Great, and Living Longer</i>, Don Colbert, M.D. makes a compelling case for Christians to use the blueprint of this appetizing spin on traditional faith-based diet books to develop a healthier lifestyle using foods available today. "If you truly want to follow Jesus in every area of your life, you cannot ignore your eating habits," postulates Colbert. He examines America's alarming addiction to fast food, explores Old Testament Jewish dietary laws, and takes a comprehensive look at foods mentioned in the Bible, from herbs to bread to meat. To this information Colbert adds a healthy serving of Scripture references, mixes in a few anecdotes, and finishes the book with an easy-to-follow weekly eating guide. Colbert also tackles the subject of drinking red wine as part of a healthy lifestyle, something often ignored in Christian-based health books. Readers looking for spiritual reasons to make dietary changes will discover excellent justification here to take the plunge. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i>Don Colbert, M.D., a board-certified family practitioner since 1984, is the author of such bestsellers as What Would Jesus Eat?, Toxic Relief, Walking in Divine Health, and the Bible Cure Booklet Series.

Twelve-year-old Steven Peters, grandson of the author, learns from Peters the history and traditions of their people, including the creation of a special clambake.

Grant and Robert E. Lee--The War They Fought, the Peace They Forged</h2><p>They met in person only four times, yet these two men&#x2014;Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee&#x2014;determined the outcome of America's most divisive war and cast larger-than-life shadows over their reunited nation. They came from vastly different backgrounds: Lee from a distinguished family of waning fortunes; Grant, a young man on the make in a new America. Differing circumstances colored their outlooks on life: Lee, the melancholy realist; Grant, the incurable optimist.<br><br>Then came the Civil War that made them both commanders of armies, leaders of men, and heroes to the multitudes of Americans then and since who rightfully place them in the pantheon of our greatest soldiers. Forged in battle as generals, these two otherwise very different men became almost indistinguishable in their instincts, attributes, attitudes, and skills in command.<br><br>Each the subject of innumerable biographies, Generals Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee have never before been paired as they are here. Exploring their personalities, their characters, their ethical and moral compasses, and their political and military worlds, William C. Davis, one of America's preeminent historians, uses substantial, newly discovered evidence on both men to find surprising similarities between them, as well as new insights and unique interpretations on how their lives prepared them for the war they fought and influenced how they fought it.<br><br><i>Crucible of Command</i> is both a gripping narrative of the final year of the war and a fresh, revealing portrait of these two great commanders as they took each other's measure across the battlefield with the aid of millions of men.</p><p><b>William C. Davis</b> is the author or editor of more than fifty books in the fields of Civil War and Southern history, as well as numerous documentary screenplays.

He is a member of the Advisory Board of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission and serves on several other consultative bodies. He lives in Blacksburg, Virginia.<br>"There are many volumes contrasting Lee and Grant, but William C. Davis has gone far beyond the typical wartime comparisons. This beautifully written and wonderfully entertaining study falls right into line with his other excellent works, and the side-by-side comparisons of the lives and growth of Lee and Grant offer far more than the usual examination of Civil War strategy. This is a surprisingly fresh addition to any Civil War library."<b> Jeff Shaara</b>, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Gods and Generals</i><br><br>"William C. Davis brings a vast familiarity with events and personalities of the Civil War to this engaging portrait of the conflict's two great military figures. With keen analysis and descriptive flair, Davis creates a narrative that plays out against an epic story. Even readers familiar with the basic outline of the generals' lives will read this book with pleasure and profit."<b> Gary W. Gallagher</b>, author of <i>The Union War</i><br><br>"This refreshingly new comparative study rises above overworked analyses of strategy and tactics and concentrates on character and personality. For those who like their history human, here is the starting point for an accurate understanding of what Lee and Grant meant to each other as well as to the nation they molded."<b> James I. Robertson, Jr.</b>, author of <i>Stonewall Jackson</i><br><br><b>A Main Selection of The History Book Club</b><br><br><b>Advance praise for <i>Crucible of Command</i></b><br><br>"Dual biographies are famously difficult to pull off, but William C. Davis has done it with panache. His research in previously unexploited sources reveals new information and insights on both Grant and Lee. With narrative skill that shifts the focus back and forth between the two generals, Davis builds the tension as their careers converge toward the climax at Appomattox. Here we have something genuinely new in Civil War scholarship."<b> James M. McPherson</b>, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Battle Cry of Freedom</i><br><br>"Magical and magisterial, William C. Davis's transportive joint biography truly brings these iconic warriors vividly to life., tracing their inevitably linked stories so compellingly that readers will be forgiven if they find themselves on the edge of their seats as the narrative hurtles toward an outcome they thought they already knew. Using primary sources with his customary commitment to originality, Davis manages to interpret the data both judiciously and jauntily.

His voice is sharp and opinionated, peppered with compliments and criticism, with virtually every assertion supported by a detailed citation. Smoothly written and accessible, the book is also a history buff's dream, brimming with arrow-filled battle maps and dotted with familiar characters and controversies Scrupulously evenhanded Mr. Davis's narrative is well-paced, and the smash-cut transitions from one theater of war to another are smoothly handled Despite his careful analysis, Mr. Davis avoids professorial dryness, and colorful personal details of both men emerge.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Winner of The American Civil War Museum's 2014 Jefferson Davis Award</b><br> Masterful interweaving of Lee's and Grant's complex and somewhat tortuous journey to their Civil War eminence&#x201d; in a way that helps us understand both men better&#x201d; within a wonderfully understandable context of military history.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Miami Sun News</i>, 1/26/15</b><br> Combining all the elements one could wish in what is essentially a dual biography and a military history of the Civil War as it impacted the careers of its two leading generals, this work of extraordinary scholarship deserves a place on the bookshelf of anyone interested in American history in particular and the art of war in general.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Bookviews blog, February 2015</b><br> The fascination with the American Civil War has generated many books and there's always room for one more, especially if it is as good as <i>Crucible of Command</i>.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Richmond Times-Dispatch</i>, 2/8/15</b><br> A revelatory portrait of both men.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Civil War News</i>, Feb/Mar 2015</b><br> Very readable and informative Davis succeeds in his goal of providing personal insights into the lives and command styles of both generals.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Civil War Times</i>, April 2015</b><br> The latest and the best dual biography <i>Crucible of Command</i> reads fresh.

Jesus Freaks, Vol. II, features testimonies of revolutionaries who took a stand for Christ against the culture of their day, along with new stories of martyrs through the centuries. dc Talk again challenges readers to pray for the persecuted church around the world and openly stand for Jesus.</p><p>dc Talk, comprised of Michael Tait, Toby McKeehan, and Kevin Max, are leaders in the pursuit of melding music with provocative questions of faith. They have received numerous awards, including three Grammys, two platinum albums, and two gold albums.Authored by Toby McKeehan, Michael Tait and Kevin Max-members of the Christian rap group dc Talk-this compilation, like the first Jesus Freaks book, tells the stories of Christians throughout history who took a brave stand for their faith. Told in non-chronological order (an account of the gospel writer Luke's life comes after a present-day story of a young American girl who sent her Bible to a boy in Sudan), it effectively argues that Christian commitment is timeless. Most of the stories read not as historical accounts but as morality tales designed to rally the faithful. Unfortunately, the authors rarely clarify which accounts are based on sound historical documentation and which are based on legend. Interspersed among the stories are biblical passages as well as brief commentaries from the authors. Earnest and heartfelt, these commentaries sometimes include insights about the martyrdom of Christians at the hands of other Christians, but at other times lapse into offensive Christian triumphalism. While the authors do occasionally acknowledge that non-Christians have been persecuted and martyred for their religious and political beliefs, they portray Christian zeal as unique and superior to all other commitments. They sometimes display limited understanding of the other religions they discuss, as when they refer to Sikhs as "Hindus." However, such shortcomings are unlikely to bother the book's intended readers, who will be compelled by the stories of people who care enough about a cause to give their lives. (Oct.)

The best player of the Oakland A&#x2019;s dynasty, which won three straight World Series, he was the first big-money free agent, wooed and flattered by George Steinbrenner into coming to the New York Yankees, which hadn&#x2019;t won a World Series since 1962. But Reggie was about to learn, as he writes in this vivid and surprising memoir, that until his initial experience on the Yankees &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know what alone meant.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His manager, the mercurial, alcoholic, and pugilistic Billy Martin, never wanted him on the team and let Reggie&#x2014;and the rest of the team&#x2014;know it. Most of his new teammates, resentful of his contract, were aloof at best and hostile at worst. Brash and outspoken, but unused to the ferocity of New York&#x2019;s tabloid culture, Reggie hadn&#x2019;t realized how rumor and offhand remarks can turn into screaming negative headlines&#x2014;especially for a black athlete with a multimillion-dollar contract. Sickened by Martin&#x2019;s anti-Semitism, his rages, and his quite public disparagement of his new star, ostracized by his teammates, and despairing of how he was stereotyped in the press, Reggie had long talks with his father about quitting. Things hit bottom when Martin plotted to humiliate him during a nationally televised game against the Red Sox. It seemed as if a glorious career had been derailed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then: Reggie vowed to persevere; his pride, work ethic, and talent would overcome Martin&#x2019;s nearly sociopathic hatred. Gradually, he would win over the fans, then his teammates, as the Yankees surged to the pennant. And one magical autumn evening, he became &#x201c;Mr. October&#x201d; in a World Series performance for the ages. He thought his travails were over&#x2014;until the next season when the insanity began again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Becoming Mr. October</i> is a revelatory self-portrait of a baseball icon at the height of his public fame and private anguish. Filled with revealing anecdotes about the notorious &#x201c;Bronx Zoo&#x201d; Yankees of the late 1970s and bluntly honest portrayals of his teammates and competitors, this is eye-opening baseball history as can be told only by the man who lived it.</p><p><b>REGGIE JACKSON</b> was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1993. He hit 563 home runs and drove in 1,702 runs over the course of his twenty-one-year career. He played three World Series&#x2013;winning seasons with the Oakland Athletics and two with the New York Yankees.

By studying fish in streams and by closely observing the natural water cycle, Viktor Schauberger (1885-1958) was able to solve basic problems of energy transformation. He saw that modern man, without realizing it, was destroying the earth and sabotaging his own cultures by working against Nature. All the prevailing methods of energy generation - from hydro-electric to nuclear fission - produce harmful long-term effects on the environment and encourage disease. Schauberger had a clear vision of how fertility could be restored to the earth. As an inventor Schauberger developed a number of ingenious machines which would revolutionize farming, horticulture, forestry and aircraft propulsion. He developed water purification systems, and showed how air and water could be harnessed as fuels for many machines. His discovery of implosive energy and diamagnetism had many practical applications, most of which have yet to be developed.</p><p>Olof Alexandersson is an electrical engineer and an active conservationist in Sweden.Text: English, Swedish (translation)</p><h2>The Rising (Darkness Rising, 3)</h2><p><p>The race for survival comes to a thrilling conclusion in the heart-stopping finale to the Darkness Rising trilogy, from #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Kelley Armstrong.</p><p>Things are getting desperate for Maya and her friends.

After his family discovers him, Valen becomes resolved to learn the book's power. At stake is not only the protection of an innocent boy sheltered at the abbey from greedy princes vying for control of their dead father's kingdom but also the entire world's salvation. Like much fantasy marketed as "adult" today, this well-written novel is suitable for readers as young as middle-schoolers, though some preteens may find it a bit too dark and slow for their tastes.<i> (May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 2000 he relocated to Denver, Colorado where he taught high school English and began writing fiction.

In 2009 Adrian moved to Melbourne, Australia with his wife and two children.<br><br>Rising through the criminal ranks of post&#x2013;cease fire Belfast, Killian earned a reputation as a persuader, an enforcer strong-arming with words rather than weapons. Killian&#x2019;s Pavee (Irish Traveller) heritage taught the power of story, and it&#x2019;s said that he can use it to compel a man to hand over a shotgun and sign over his home. With Northern Ireland&#x2019;s economic straits forcing Killian to emerge from retirement, he is hired to locate a junkie ex-wife, whose disappearance has deprived his client of fatherhood. Tipped to the true reason for her flight, the client knows that Killian can&#x2019;t be trusted to choose cash over principle, and he hires an assassin to track them all. Killian&#x2019;s perspective alternates with the assassin&#x2019;s, creating a double-sided cat-and-mouse game where a victory by either seems inconceivable. The mystical and marginalized Pavee subculture is molded brilliantly by McKinty into the perfect pivot for a novel exploring the concept of honor outside the law.

Much has been written about Sugihara, but this book focuses on the refugees' journey from Poland to Lithuania, then across the Soviet Union on the Trans-Siberian Railroad to the port of Vladivostok, by ship across the Sea of Japan to Tsuruga, and by train to Kobe. A majority of them survived World War II in Japanese-occupied Shanghai. With an introduction by Susan Bachrach, the narrative offers a profile of the refugees and details their journey and time spent in Shanghai, where they struggled to live in broken-down, cramped accommodations and with a scarcity of food. There, too, 300 students and rabbis of the Mir Yeshiva continued their rigorous studies.

An absurdity. You could hang me over the door of a pawnshop&#x201d;), is a painter of some renown and a petty thief who has never before been caught and steals only for pleasure. Both art and the art of thievery have been part of his &#x201c;endless effort at possession,&#x201d; but now he&#x2019;s pushing fifty, feels like a hundred, and things have not been going so well. Having recognized the &#x201c;man-killing crevasse&#x201d; that exists between what he sees and any representation he might make of it, he has stopped painting. And his last act of thievery&#x2014;the last time he felt its &#x201c;secret shiver of bliss&#x201d;&#x2014;has been discovered. The fact that the purloined possession was the wife of the man who was, perhaps, his best friend has compelled him to run away&#x2014;from his mistress, his home, his wife; from whatever remains of his impulse to paint; and from a tragedy that has long haunted him&#x2014;and to sequester himself in the house where he was born. Trying to uncover in himself the answer to how and why things have turned out as they have, excavating memories of family, of places he has called home, and of the way he has apprehended the world around him (&#x201c;one of my eyes is forever turning towards the world beyond&#x201d;), Olly reveals the very essence of a man who, in some way, has always been waiting to be rescued from himself.</p></p><p><b>JOHN BANVILLE&nbsp;</b>was born in Wexford, Ireland, in 1945.

Which is a fancy way of saying I steal things. Always did, as far back as I can remember. I may fairly claim to have been a child prodigy in the fine art of thieving. This is my shameful secret, one of my shameful secrets, of which, however, I am not as ashamed as I should be. I do not steal for profit. The objects, the artefacts, that I purloin&#x2014;there is a nice word, prim and pursed&#x2014;are of scant value for the most part. Oftentimes their owners don&#x2019;t even miss them. This upsets me, puts me in a dither. I won&#x2019;t say I want to be caught, but I do want the loss to be registered; it&#x2019;s important that it should be. Important to me, I mean, and to the weight and legitimacy of the&#x2014;how shall I say? The exploit. The endeavour. The deed. I ask you, what&#x2019;s the point of stealing something if no one knows it&#x2019;s stolen save the stealer?<br> &nbsp;<br> I used to paint. That was my other passion, my other proclivity. I used to be a painter.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ha! The word I wrote down at first, instead of painter, was painster. Slip of the pen, slip of the mind. Apt, though. Once I was a painter, now I&#x2019;m a painster. Ha.<br> &nbsp;<br> I should stop, before it&#x2019;s too late. But it is too late.<br> &nbsp;<br> Orme. That&#x2019;s my name. A few of you, art lovers, art haters, may remember it, from bygone times. Oliver Orme. Oliver Otway Orme, in fact. O O O. An absurdity. You could hang me over the door of a pawnshop. Otway, by the by, after an undistinguished street where my parents lived when they were young and first together and where, presumably, they initiated me. Orme is a plausible name for a painter, isn&#x2019;t it? A painterly name. It looked well, down at the right-hand corner of a canvas, modestly minuscule but unmissable, the&nbsp;<i>O</i>an owlish eye, the&nbsp;<i>r</i>&nbsp;rather art-nouveauish and more like a Greek&nbsp;&#x3c4;, the&nbsp;<i>m</i>&nbsp;a pair of shoulders shaking in rich mirth, the&nbsp;<i>e</i>&nbsp;like&#x2014;oh, I don&#x2019;t&nbsp;know what. Or yes, I do: like the handle of a chamber pot. So there you have me. Orme the master painster, who paints no more.<br> &nbsp;<br> What I want to say is<br> &#x2014;<br> Storm today, the elements in a great rage. Furious gusts of wind booming against the house, shivering its ancient timbers. Why does this kind of weather always make me think of childhood, why does it make me feel I&#x2019;m back there in those olden days, crop-haired, in short trousers, with one sock sagging? Childhood is supposed to be a radiant springtime but mine seems to have been always autumn, the gales seething in the big beeches behind this old gate-lodge, as they&#x2019;re doing right now, and the rooks above them wheeling haphazard, like scraps of char from a bonfire, and a custard-coloured gleam having its last go low down in the western sky. Besides, I&#x2019;m tired of the past, of the wish to be there and not here. When I was there I writhed fretfully enough in my fetters. I&#x2019;m pushing fifty and feel a hundred, big with years.<br> &nbsp;<br> What I want to say is this, that I have decided, I have determined, to weather the storm. The interior one. I&#x2019;m not in good shape, that&#x2019;s a fact. I feel like an alarm clock that an angry sleeper, an angry waker, has given such a shake to that all the springs and sprockets inside it have come loose. I&#x2019;m all ajangle. I should take myself to Marcus Pettit for repair. Ha ha.<br> They will be missing me by now, over there on the far side of the estuary. They will wonder where I&#x2019;ve got to&#x2014;I wonder the same thing myself&#x2014;and won&#x2019;t imagine I&#x2019;m so near. Polly will be in an awful state, with no one to talk to and confide in, and no one at all to look to for comfort except Marcus, whose comfort she is hardly likely to call on, much, given the state of things. I miss her already. Why did I go? Because I couldn&#x2019;t stay. I picture her in her cramped parlour above Marcus&#x2019;s workshop, huddled in front of the fire in the murky light of&nbsp;this late-September afternoon, her knees shiny from the flames and her shins mottled in diamond shapes. She will be nibbling worriedly at a corner of her mouth with those little sharp teeth of hers that always remind me of the flecks of glistening fat in a Christmas pudding. She is, was, my own dear pudding. I ask again: Why did I leave? Such questions. I know why I left, I know very well why, and should stop pretending that I don&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marcus will be in his workshop, at his bench. I see him, too, in his sleeveless leather jerkin, intent and hardly breathing, the jeweller&#x2019;s glass screwed into his eye socket, plying his tiny instruments that are in my mind&#x2019;s eye a steel scalpel and forceps, dissecting a Patek Philippe. Although he is younger than I am&#x2014;it seems to me everyone is younger than I am&#x2014;his hair is thinning and turning grey already and, see, hangs now in feathery wisps on either side of his leaning narrow saintly face, stirred by each breath he breathes, stirred a little, a little. He used to have something of the look of the D�rer of that androgynous self-portrait, the three-quarters profile one with tawny ringlets and rosebud mouth and disconcertingly come-hither eye; latterly, though, he might be one of Gr�newald&#x2019;s suffering Christs. &#x201c;Work, Olly,&#x201d; he said to me dolefully, &#x201c;work is all I have to distract me from my anguish.&#x201d; That was the word he used: anguish. I thought it queer, even in such dire circumstances, more a flourish than a word. But pain compels eloquence&#x2014;look at me; listen to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> The child is there too, somewhere, Little Pip, as they call her&#x2014;never just Pip, always Little Pip. It&#x2019;s true she&#x2019;s quite small, but what if she grows up an amazon? Little Pip the Gentle Giantess. I shouldn&#x2019;t laugh, I know; it&#x2019;s jealousy jogging my funny bone, jealousy and sad regret. Gloria and I had a little one of our own, briefly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gloria! She had slipped my mind until this moment. She too will be wondering where on earth I am. Where, on earth.<br> &nbsp;<br> Damn it, why does everything have to be so difficult.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am going to think about the night I finally fell in love with Polly, finally for the first time, that is. Anything for diversion, even though thoughts of love are what I should be diverting myself from, seeing how hot the soup is that love has got me into. It happened at the annual dinner of the Guild of Clockmakers, Locksmiths and Goldsmiths. We were there as Marcus&#x2019;s guests, Gloria and I&#x2014;Gloria under protest, I may add, she being as susceptible as I am to boredom and general fed-upness&#x2014;and were sat with him and Polly at their table, along with some others whom we needn&#x2019;t take any notice of. Beefsteak and roast pork on the menu, and spuds, of course, boiled, mashed, baked or chipped, not forgetting your perennial bacon-and-cabbage. Perhaps it was the flabby stink of seared flesh that was making me feel peculiar; that, and the smoke from the candles on the tables and the borborygmic blarings of the three-piece band. There was a ceaseless clamour of voices behind me in the big hall, a rolling heavy swell out of which there would spurt now and then, like a fish leaping, a shriek of some woman&#x2019;s tipsy laughter. I had been drinking but I don&#x2019;t believe I was drunk. All the same, as I talked to Polly, and looked at her&#x2014;indeed, gloated on her&#x2014;I had the sense of dawning illumination, of sudden epiphany, that so often comes at a certain stage on the way to drunkenness. She seemed not newly beautiful, exactly, but to radiate something I hadn&#x2019;t noticed before, something that was hers, uniquely: the abundance of her, the very being of her being. This is fanciful, I know, and probably what I thought I was seeing was merely an effect brought on by the fumes of bad wine, but I&#x2019;m trying to fix the essence of the moment, to isolate the spark that would ignite such a conflagration of ecstasy and pain, of mischief, damage and, yes, Marcusian anguish.<br> &nbsp;<br> And anyway, who&#x2019;s to say that what we see when we&#x2019;re drunk is not reality, and the sober world a bleared phantasmagoria?<br><br> Polly is no great beauty. In saying this I am not being unchivalrous, I hope; it&#x2019;s best to start out candid, since I aim to continue that way, in so far as I am capable of candour. Of course, I found her, find her,&nbsp;altogether lovely. She is full-figured, biggish in the beam&#x2014;picture the nicely rounded nether half of a child-sized cello&#x2014;with a neat, heart-shaped face and brownish, somewhat unruly hair. Her eyes are truly remarkable. They are pale grey, they seem almost translucent, and in certain lights take on a mother-of-pearl sheen. They have a slight cast, which finds an endearing echo in the slight overlap of her two pearly front teeth. She has a placid mien for the most part, but her glance can be surprisingly sharp, and her tone at times can deliver quite a sting, quite a sting. Mostly, though, she keeps a wary eye on a world she doesn&#x2019;t feel entirely at ease in. She is always conscious of her lack of social polish&#x2014;she&#x2019;s a country lass, after all, even if her folk are shabby-grand&#x2014;in comparison to my poised Gloria, for example, and is unsure in matters of etiquette and nice behaviour. It was very affecting to see, that night at the Clockers, as the evening is colloquially known, how at the start of each course she would glance quickly about the table and check which item of cutlery the rest of us were favouring before daring to pick up knife or fork or spoon for herself. Maybe that&#x2019;s where love begins, not in sudden seizures of passion but in the recognition and simple acceptance of, of&#x2014;of something or other, I don&#x2019;t know what.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Clockers is a tedious affair, and I felt a fool for coming. I had turned my back on the festive crowd and, propped on my elbows, was leaning forwards earnestly across the table so that my face, hot and throbbing, was almost in Polly&#x2019;s bosom, or would almost have been had she not turned halfway away from me on her chair, so that she was looking sideways at me along the curve of her nicely plump right shoulder. What did I talk to her about, with such force and fervour? I can&#x2019;t remember&#x2014;not that it matters: the matter was in the tone, not the content. I could feel Gloria monitoring us, with an amused and sceptical eye. I often think Gloria married me so as always to have something to make her laugh. I don&#x2019;t mean to sound resentful, not at all. Her laughter is not cruel or even hurtful. She just finds me funny, not for what I say or do but for what I am, her rufous-headed, roly-poly and, did she but know it, light-fingered manling.<br> &nbsp;<br> Polly at this time, the time of the night at the Clockers when I fell in love with her, had been married for three or four years, and was certainly no dewy-eyed lass of the kind that might be thought susceptible to my insinuative blandishments. All the same, it was plain I was having an effect on her. Listening to me, she had taken on that vaguely staring, wide-eyed expression, accentuated by her lopsided gaze, of a married woman in whom a tentative delight is dawning as she realises, incredulously, that a man she has known for years and who is not her husband is suddenly telling her, in however roundabout and high-flown a fashion, that he has all of a sudden fallen in love with her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marcus was away among the dancers, whooping and stomping. Despite his diffident and incurably melancholic disposition he does love a party, and joins in with violent enthusiasm at the first pop of a cork or blast on a bugle&#x2014;that night he had invited Gloria no fewer than three times to jump up and join him in his capers, and on each occasion, to my considerable surprise, she had accepted. In my early days with Polly I used to try, treacherous hound that I am, to get her to talk about Marcus, to tell me things he said and did in the privacy of their lives together, but she&#x2019;s a loyal soul and let me know straight away and with impressive firmness that her husband&#x2019;s peculiarities, if indeed he had any, which she wasn&#x2019;t saying he had, were a forbidden topic.<br> &nbsp;<br> How did we meet in the first place, the four of us? I think it must have been Gloria and Polly who struck up a friendship, or better say an acquaintanceship, though I seem to have known Marcus all my life, or all of his life, since I&#x2019;m the older of the two of us. I recall an initial picnic in an ornamental park somewhere&#x2014;bread and cheese and wine and rain&#x2014;and Polly in a white summer dress, bare-legged and lissom. Inevitably, I see the occasion in the light of old man Manet&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>D�jeuner sur l&#x2019;herbe</i>&#x2014;the earlier, smaller one&#x2014;with blonde Gloria in the buff and Polly off in the background bathing her feet. <br> &nbsp;<br> Polly that day seemed hardly more than a girl, pink-cheeked and creamy, instead of the married woman that she was. Marcus was wearing a straw hat with holes in it, and Gloria was her usual glorious self, a big bright beauty shedding radiance all round her. And, my God, but my wife was magnificent that day, as indeed she always is. At thirty-five she has attained the full splendour of maturity. I think of her in terms of various metals, gold, of course, because of her hair, and silver for her skin, but there is something in her too of the opulence of brass and bronze: she has a wonderful shine to her, a stately glow. In fact, she is a Tiepolo rather than a Manet type, one of the Venetian master&#x2019;s Cleopatras, say, or his Beatrice of Burgundy. To my luminous Gloria, Polly could hardly hold one of those little votive candles people used to pay a penny for in church and set burning in front of their favourite saint&#x2019;s statue. Why then did I&#x2014;? Ah, now, that&#x2019;s the nub of the matter, one of the nubs, that I have worn everything down to.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Clockers ended in the mysteriously abrupt way that such things do, and most of the people at our table had already risen and were making befuddled attempts to organise themselves for departure when Polly fairly sprang to her feet, thinking of Little Pip, I imagine&#x2014;Polly&#x2019;s father and her addled mother were supposedly minding the child&#x2014;but then paused a second and did a curious, shivery little flounce, surprisedly smiling with eyebrows raised and her hands held out from her sides with the palms flat on the air, like a toddler attempting a curtsy. It may have been nothing more than the effect of her bum detaching itself from the seat of her chair&#x2014;it was very hot and humid in the room&#x2014;but to me it seemed that she had been lifted, suddenly, lightly, by the action of some invisible and buoyant medium: that she was, literally, and for a second, walking on air. This was hardly the result of the fervid harangue I had been subjecting her to in the absence of her husband, yet I was moved, to hot tears, almost, feeling I had somehow been allowed to share with her in this brief and secret exaltation.

Think of the moment you last experienced God. Do you know him that closely in this moment? Truly experiencing the love of God gives us a taste of his goodness and his love for us, but often those moments are fleeting. We get distracted by life. Our awareness and understanding fade while our longing to experience him that way again increases. In these pages you can begin to fill that longing by developing your capacity to receive and respond to God's love. Spiritual formation is the process through which one's inner self is opened to the work of the Holy Spirit, who forms us into the image of the Son. Here Richard Foster and Gayle Beebe, both experienced leaders in spiritual formation, introduce you to people from the past who have known God deeply. Each person helps you to grasp one of the seven primary paths to intimacy with God that have been developed throughout Christian history. Chapters are divided into sections, each segment surrounding a key figure and concluding with a reflection and prayer. This rich resource can guide you into the same deep intimacy with God, opening you to the Spirit's work of transformation.</p><p>&#34;Today we are in a state of flooding and yet have no water to drink. It is difficult to find authentic principles that satisfy our spiritual thirst.

Richard Foster and Gayle Beebe show us how our faith ancestors found the wellspring of the deep and authentic spirituality and drew the fresh water that cleared their thirst.

Or an uninhabitable wasteland, if the terraforming fails. Now the solar mirror vital to the terraforming of the conquered planet has been shattered by a ship hurtling off course. The Emperor of Barrayar sends his newest Imperial Auditor, Lord Miles Vorkosigan, to find out why. The choice is not a popular one on Komarr, where a betrayal a generation before drenched the name of Vorkosigan in blood. In the political and physical claustrophobia of the domed cities, are the Komarrans surrounding Miles loyal subjects, potential hostages, innocent victims, or rebels bidding for revenge? Lies within lies, treachery within treachery - Miles is caught in a race against time to stop a plot that could exile him from Barrayar forever. His burning hope lies in an unexpected ally, one with wounds as deep and honor as beleaguered as his own.</p><p>Lois McMaster Bujold comes through again with another sharp Miles Vorkosigan novel. <i>Komarr</i> can be read as a standalone, though it is part of a whole series. (<i>Komarr</i> brings the total to 16 books!) Miles is a hugely popular character with fans--and they won't be disappointed with his latest adventure. <p> The planet Komarr is undergoing centuries-long terraforming when one of the orbiting mirrors crucial to the effort is smashed by an off-course ship. Miles Vorkosigan is sent to Komarr to investigate the incident; once there, he becomes embroiled in political and scientific battles. To make matters worse, the name Vorkosigan is anathema on Komarr. But our intrepid hero can't be put down easily. While trying to save Komarr, he manages... maybe... to find true love at last!

Spanning a half-century before, during, and after the war, this gripping narrative illuminates the Revolution&#x2019;s darker side as patriots vilified, threatened, and in some cases killed pacifist Quakers as alleged enemies of the revolutionary cause. Amid chaos and danger, the Drinkers tried as best they could to keep their family and faith intact.<br> &nbsp;<br> Through one couple&#x2019;s story, Godbeer opens a window on a uniquely turbulent period of American history, uncovers the domestic, social, and religious lives of Quakers in the late eighteenth century, and situates their experience in the context of transatlantic culture and trade.

The war forged an industry that would redefine transportation and warfare for future generations. In <i>First to Fly</i>, lauded historian Charles Bracelen Flood tells the story of the men who were at the forefront of that revolution: the daredevil Americans of the Lafayette Escadrille, who flew in French planes, wore French uniforms, and showed the world an American brand of heroism before the United States entered the Great War.<br><br>As citizens of a neutral nation from 1914 to early 1917, Americans were prohibited from serving in a foreign army, but many brave young souls soon made their way into European battle zones: as ambulance drivers, nurses, and more dangerously, as soldiers in the French Foreign Legion. It was partly from the ranks of the latter group, and with the sponsorship of an expat American surgeon and a Vanderbilt, that the Lafayette Escadrille was formed in 1916 as the first and only all-American squadron in the French Air Service. Flying rudimentary planes, against one-in-three odds of being killed, these fearless young men gathered reconnaissance and shot down enemy aircraft, participated in the Battle of Verdun and faced off with the Red Baron, dueling across the war-torn skies like modern knights on horseback.<br><br>Drawing on rarely seen primary sources, Flood chronicles the startling success of that intrepid band, and gives a compelling look at the rise of aviation and a new era of warfare.</p><p><b>Charles Bracelen Flood</b> (1929-2014) wrote fifteen books, including <i>Lee: The Last Years</i> and <i>Grant and Sherman: The Friendship That Won the Civil War</i>, which Salon named one of the Top 12 Civil War Books Ever Written,&#x201d; and the<i>New York Times</i> bestselling novel <i>Love is a Bridge</i>.

At noon a massive Zulu host attacked the 24th Regiment in its encampment at the foot of the mountain of Isandlwana, a distinctive feature that bore an eerie resemblance to the Sphinx badge of the outnumbered redcoats.

Because the fatal loss was so high on the British side there is still much that is unknown about the battle. This is a work of unparalleled depth, which eschews the commonly held perception that the British collapse was sudden and that the 24th Regiment was quickly overwhelmed. Rather, there was a protracted and heroic defense against a determined and equally heroic foe. <br><br>The author reconstructs the final phase of the battle in a way that has never been attempted before.

While most people in America today relegate monsters to just that--our imaginations--we continue to be fascinated by the unknown. Linda Godfrey is one of the country's leading authorities on modern-day monsters and has interviewed countless eyewitnesses to strange phenomena. Monsters evolve, taking on both new and familiar forms over time and across cultures. In this well-researched book, Godfrey explores uncanny encounters with werewolves, goatmen, Bigfoot, and more.<br><br>In more than twenty-five years spent "chasing" monsters, Godfrey has found that it often remains unclear whether the sightings are simply mistaken animals, hoaxes, or coincidence. When all the speculation is said and done, one question remains for fans and researchers: Are the creatures "real," or are they entirely "other-world?" Godfrey suspects that it isn't an either/or question--our reality operates on a scale from dense matter to realms the human eye cannot see. <br><br>As Godfrey investigates unexplained phenomena, her search for answers will fascinate casual observers and enthusiasts alike.</p><p><b>Linda S.

The good news is there will be no pop quiz here. I&#x2019;m strictly an amateur folklorist myself. But like any subject pinned down and formalized by academia, folkore has its own accepted lingo. Luckily, the short list will do for our purposes. But the terms&#x2014;f olklore, legend, and myth&#x2014; are not as interchangeable as casual users might think. And merely pasting the correct label on the story type of a creature encounter won&#x2019;t prove the true nature of that cryptid. The folklore/legend labels are simply tools to help us categorize things that lounge beyond our comprehension&#x2014; things such as, perhaps, legends of meat hooks guarded by dog women, to be examined in our next chapter. But before we run off with a pack of hounds to bay at Pennsylvania&#x2019;s October moon, let&#x2019;s go over the basic categories.<br><br> Legends are stories from the past, ranging from far ancient times to mere decades or less. The stories are told as if based upon the experiences of some actual (if unknown) person or group of persons, and are sometimes still alleged to be occurring. They may contain an element of the supernatural, such as the Loch Ness&#x2013; type situation that popped up in 1892 in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, and lasted for at least a full decade.<br><br> The resort town near the Wisconsin- Illinois border became famous for modern-day sightings of a huge lake serpent spotted by area residents and tourists in the city&#x2019;s springfed Geneva Lake, one of the state&#x2019;s deepest bodies of water. (The city and lake are distinguished by the word order of their respective titles.) According to reports, the sinuous, scale-covered creature chased groups of boaters and was witnessed by a well-respected minister from nearby Delavan, the Reverend M. N. Clark. Some witnesses estimated the serpent&#x2019;s length as equal to that of a familiar lake ves-sel, the Steamship Aurora, which measured sixty-five feet! Residents nicknamed the serpent Jenny (or Genny).<br><br> Area newspapers recorded some incidents viewed by multiple witnesses. An article in The Milwaukee Sentinel reported one sighting by no fewer than six people in September 1902. The mystery creature disappeared soon after that date, fading with the tourist season, her origin and escape route still unknown. Perhaps as boat traffic became heavier, the lake could no longer protect creatures that needed to stick their long necks out of the water for air. But legends explaining where she might have gone already existed in the area.<br><br> Jenny wasn&#x2019;t the first outsize gigantic creature believed to swim in Geneva Lake. She was preceded by ancient legends of other lake monsters taken as a matter of course by the town&#x2019;s former residents, the Potawatomi, the last native tribal people to live on the shores of the seven- and- a- half- mile- long lake. Area chronicler Paul B. Jenkins and other local historians recorded local Na-tive belief in several different water monsters, including a great, horned water serpent much like Jenny; a giant fish; and the strange water panther, or water spirit. (More on the latter creature later.) <br><br> Incidentally, the Potawatomi leader at that time was known as Chief Big Foot. This name had nothing to do with the large, hairy, humanlike creature now popularly called Bigfoot, a term that didn&#x2019;t come into use in that sense until the 1960s or so. The chieftain&#x2019;s name was said to have come from the large footprints he left by walking in snowshoes, or in mud that spread out and enlarged his tracks&#x2014;whichever version you choose to believe. But he is the reason why near the Wisconsin-Illinois border, you&#x2019;ll find a small community named Big Foot, a Big Foot High School in the city of Walworth, a Big Foot Archery Club, and other places and things intended to honor the displaced chieftain. His footprints became a legend in their own way.<br><br> The lake monster stories told by the Potawatomi and other area First Nation folk were also published in a series of pamphlets by Charles E. Brown1 and Dorothy Moulding Brown in the Wis-consin State Historical Society from the late 1920s to the early 1940s. This was twenty to forty years after the decade-long lake monster flap in Geneva Lake (and many other Wisconsin lakes, as well), which showed that sightings of the aquatic creature weren&#x2019;t inspired by the Browns&#x2019; later published stories.<br><br> To complicate the origins of these legends, the stories of bat-tles between the water panther, lake serpent, and thunderbird are widespread in the lore of various Midwestern Native people, and may have been known to Big Foot&#x2019;s Potawatomi band before they moved to southeastern Wisconsin from the western shores of Lake Michigan around 1700 to 1800. For all we know, Big Foot&#x2019;s people may have localized the older story to fit their own observations of Geneva Lake. But that does not make the legend any less important, just more universal. And it is always thrilling to find a universal truth living in your own backyard.We may trace Jenny the Lake Monster, then, from very old indigenous legend, to fairly contemporary sightings in the early 1900s, to written versions recorded by folklorists a decade or more after the sightings ended. With such strong oral and written back-ground, the Jenny sightings&nbsp; really do seem like legends come to life. <br><br> So who saw her first, Big Foot&#x2019;s band, the turn-of-the-century tourists, or more ancient native inhabitants of Geneva&#x2019;s shores? If only we knew how long the sightings had been occurring, we might be able to associate the correct ancient lake monster legend with the modern Jenny. But given the time frame of the sightings, Jenny could also technically glide into the subject of our next&nbsp; category. . .</p><h2>Right Out of California: The 1930s and the Big Business Roots of Modern Conservatism</h2><p>In a major reassessment of modern conservatism, noted historian Kathryn S. Olmsted reexamines the explosive labor disputes in the agricultural fields of Depression-era California, the cauldron that inspired a generation of artists and writers and that triggered the intervention of FDR&#x2019;s New Deal. <i>Right Out of California</i> tells how this brief moment of upheaval terrified business leaders into rethinking their relationship to American politics&#x2014;a narrative that pits a ruthless generation of growers against a passionate cast of reformers, writers, and revolutionaries.<br> <br>Olmsted reveals how California&#x2019;s businessmen learned the language of populism with the help of allies in the media and entertainment industries, and in the process created a new style of politics: corporate funding of grassroots groups, military-style intelligence gathering against political enemies, professional campaign consultants, and alliances between religious and economic conservatives. The business leaders who battled for the hearts and minds of Depression-era California, moreover, would go on to create the organizations that launched the careers of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.

Simultaneous.</p><p>Ian Frazier is the author of On the Rez, Great Plains, Family, Coyote v. Acme, and, most recently, Dating Your Mom.The latest sampling of choice nonfiction from America's literary journals and magazines, in a series that is a perennial success. In his introduction, this year's editor, humorist Frazier (Acme v. Coyote, 1996, etc.), describes the essay as a piece that happens when a writer quits longing for form and just writes ``for no better reason than the fun and release of saying.'' And because the genre ``provides a way to tell the narratives and speculate on them at the same time,'' he suggests, it has a particular appeal for an age quite self-absorbed and anxious to puzzle out where it is going. There are some familiar practitioners of the form here, including Susan Sontag, Cynthia Ozick, and Gay Talese. Other veteran writers, such as poet Charles Simic and novelists Richard Ford and Thomas McGuane, are less well known as essayists, though equally strong. And some less familiar writers contribute startling work. Among the standouts is Jo Ann Beard's tour-de-force ``The Fourth State of Matter,'' which describes in fascinating detail the events leading up to tragedy when a disillusioned physics doctoral candidate named Gang Lu shot up the offices of the Iowa City scientific journal where Beard was the managing editor, killing several people; and Paul Sheehan's ``My Habit,'' on his crack-vial collection, which retains its allure even without the cool photographs of his unusual archive that accompanied the essay's original publication in the New Yorker. Boston-based psychologist Lauren Slater's ``Black Swans,'' in which she describes her battles with obsessive-compulsive disorder, has a painful vibrancy. Vietnamese-American L&#x2c6; Thi Diem Th�y's ``The Gangster We Are All Looking For'' is a wrenching exploration of immigrant life in California. Discrete but complementary entertainments in a range of keys that continue to define what is surely one of our most robust literary forms. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Its destiny is a tumultuous voyage across the Indian Ocean, its purpose to fight China&#x2019;s vicious nineteenth-century Opium Wars. As for the crew, they are a motley array of sailors and stowaways, coolies and convicts. In a time of colonial upheaval, fate has thrown together a diverse cast of Indians and Westerners, from a bankrupt Raja to a widowed tribeswoman, from a mulatto American freedman to a free-spirited French orphan. As their old family ties are washed away, they, like their historical counterparts, come to view themselves as jahaj-bhais, or ship brothers. An unlikely dynasty is born, which will span continents, races, and generations. The vast sweep of this historical adventure embraces the lush poppy fields of the Ganges, the rolling high seas, and the crowded backstreets of Canton. But it is the panorama of characters, whose diaspora encapsulates the vexed colonial history of the East itself, that makes Sea of Poppies so breathtakingly alive &#x2013; a masterpiece from one of the world&#x2019;s finest novelists. "Such is the power of Ghosh's precise, understated prose that one occasionally wishes to turn the pages three at a time, eager to find out where Ghosh's tale is headed." - The Boston Globe</p><p>Amitav Ghosh is the internationally bestselling author of many works of fiction and non-fiction, including the novel The Glass Palace, and the recipient of numerous prizes and awards. He divides his time between Kolkata and Goa, India, and Brooklyn, New York.<p>One</p><p>The vision of a tall-masted ship, at sail on the ocean, came to Deeti on an otherwise ordinary day, but she knew instantly that the apparition was a sign of destiny, for she had never seen such a vessel before, not even in a dream: how could she have, living as she did in northern Bihar, four hundred miles from the coast? Her village was so far inland that the sea seemed as distant as the netherworld: it was the chasm of darkness where the holy Ganga disappeared into the Kala-Pani, &#x2018;the Black Water&#x2019;.</p><p>It happened at the end of winter, in a year when the poppies were strangely slow to shed their petals: for mile after mile, from Benares onwards, the Ganga seemed to be flowing between twin glaciers, both its banks being blanketed by thick drifts of white-petalled flowers. It was as if the snows of the high Himalayas had descended on the plains to await the arrival of Holi and its springtime profusion of colour.</p><p>The village in which Deeti lived was on the outskirts of the town of Ghazipur, some fifty miles east of Benares. Like all her neighbours, Deeti was preoccupied with the lateness of her poppy crop: that day, she rose early and went through the motions of her daily routine, laying out a freshly washed dhoti and kameez for Hukam Singh, her husband, and preparing the rotis and achar he would eat at midday. Once his meal had been wrapped and packed, she broke off to pay a quick visit to her shrine room: later, after she&#x2019;d bathed and changed, Deeti would do a proper puja, with flowers and offerings; now, being clothed still in her night-time sari, she merely stopped at the door, to join her hands in a brief genuflection.</p><p>Soon a squeaking wheel announced the arrival of the ox-cart that would take Hukam Singh to the factory where he worked, in Ghazipur, three miles away. Although not far, the distance was too great for Hukam Singh to cover on foot, for he had been wounded in the leg while serving as a sepoy in a British regiment. The disability was not so severe as to require crutches, however, and Hukam Singh was able to make his way to the cart without assistance. Deeti followed a step behind, carrying his food and water, handing the cloth-wrapped package to him after he had climbed in.</p><p>Kalua, the driver of the ox-cart, was a giant of a man, but he made no move to help his passenger and was careful to keep his face hidden from him: he was of the leather-workers&#x2019; caste and Hukam Singh, as a high-caste Rajput, believed that the sight of his face would bode ill for the day ahead. Now, on climbing into the back of the cart, the former sepoy sat facing to the rear, with his bundle balanced on his lap, to prevent its coming into direct contact with any of the driver&#x2019;s belongings. Thus they would sit, driver and passenger, as the cart creaked along the road to Ghazipur&#x2014;conversing amicably enough, but never exchanging glances.</p><p>Deeti, too, was careful to keep her face covered in the driver&#x2019;s presence: it was only when she went back inside, to wake Kabutri, her six-year-old daughter, that she allowed the ghungta of her sari to slip off her head. Kabutri was lying curled on her mat and Deeti knew, because of her quickly changing pouts and smiles, that she was deep in a dream: she was about to rouse her when she stopped her hand and stepped back. In her daughter&#x2019;s sleeping face, she could see the lineaments of her own likeness&#x2014;the same full lips, rounded nose and upturned chin&#x2014;except that in the child the lines were still clean and sharply drawn, whereas in herself they had grown smudged and indistinct. After seven years of marriage, Deeti was not much more than a child herself, but a few tendrils of white had already appeared in her thick black hair. The skin of her face, parched and darkened by the sun, had begun to flake and crack around the corners of her mouth and her eyes. Yet, despite the careworn commonplaceness of her appearance, there was one respect in which she stood out from the ordinary: she had light grey eyes, a feature that was unusual in that part of the country. Such was the colour&#x2014;or perhaps colourlessness&#x2014;of her eyes that they made her seem at once blind and all-seeing. This had the effect of unnerving the young, and of reinforcing their prejudices and superstitions to the point where they would sometimes shout taunts at her&#x2014;chudaliya, dainiya&#x2014;as if she were a witch: but Deeti had only to turn her eyes on them to make them scatter and run off. Although not above taking a little pleasure in her powers of discomfiture, Deeti was glad, for her daughter&#x2019;s sake, that this was one aspect of her appearance that she had not passed on&#x2014;she delighted in Kabutri&#x2019;s dark eyes, which were as black as her shiny hair. Now, looking down on her daughter&#x2019;s dreaming face, Deeti smiled and decided that she wouldn&#x2019;t wake her after all: in three or four years the girl would be married and gone; there would be enough time for her to work when she was received into her husband&#x2019;s house; in her few remaining years at home she might as well rest.</p><p>With scarcely a pause for a mouthful of roti, Deeti stepped outside, on to the flat threshold of beaten earth that divided the mud-walled dwelling from the poppy fields beyond. By the light of the newly risen sun, she saw, greatly to her relief, that some of her flowers had at last begun to shed their petals. On the adjacent field, her husband&#x2019;s younger brother, Chandan Singh, was already out with his eight-bladed nukha in hand. He was using the tool&#x2019;s tiny teeth to make notches on some of the bare pods&#x2014;if the sap flowed freely overnight he would bring his family out tomorrow, to tap the field. The timing had to be exactly right because the priceless sap flowed only for a brief period in the plant&#x2019;s span of life: a day or two this way or that, and the pods were of no more value than the blossoms of a weed.</p><p>Chandan Singh had seen her too and he was not a person who could let anyone pass by in silence. A slack-jawed youth with a brood of five children of his own, he never missed an opportunity to remind Deeti of her paucity of offspring. Ka bha�l? he called out, licking a drop of fresh sap from the tip of his instrument. What&#x2019;s the matter? Working alone again? How long can you carry on like this? You need a son, to give you a helping hand. You&#x2019;re not barren, after all . . .</p><p>Being accustomed to her brother-in-law&#x2019;s ways, Deeti had no difficulty in ignoring his jibes: turning her back on him, she headed into her own field, carrying a wide wicker basket at her waist. Between the rows of flowers, the ground was carpeted in papery petals and she scooped them up in handfuls, dropping them into her basket. A week or two before, she would have taken care to creep sideways, so as not to disturb the flowers, but today she all but flounced as she went and was none too sorry when her swishing sari swept clusters of petals off the ripening pods. When the basket was full, she carried it back and emptied it next to the outdoor chula where she did most of her cooking. This part of the threshold was shaded by two enormous mango trees, which had just begun to sprout the dimples that would grow into the first buds of spring. Relieved to be out of the sun, Deeti squatted beside her oven and thrust an armload of firewood into last night&#x2019;s embers, which could still be seen glowing, deep inside the ashes.</p><p>Kabutri was awake now, and when she showed her face in the doorway, her mother was no longer in a mood to be indulgent. So late? she snapped. Where were you? K�m-o-k�j na hoi? You think there&#x2019;s no work to be done?</p><p>Deeti gave her daughter the job of sweeping the poppy petals into a heap while she busied herself in stoking the fire and heating a heavy iron tawa. Once this griddle was heated through, she sprinkled a handful of petals on it and pressed them down with a bundled-up rag. Darkening as they toasted, the petals began to cling together so that in a minute or two they looked exactly like the round wheat-flour rotis Deeti had packed for her husband&#x2019;s midday meal. And &#x2018;roti&#x2019; was indeed the name by which these poppy-petal wrappers were known although their purpose was entirely different from that of their namesake: they were to be sold to the Sudder Opium Factory, in Ghazipur, where they would be used to line the earthenware containers in which opium was packed.</p><p>Kabutri, in the meanwhile, had kneaded some atta and rolled out a few real rotis. Deeti cooked them quickly, before poking out the fire: the rotis were put aside, to be eaten later with yesterday&#x2019;s leftovers&#x2014;a dish of stale alu-posth, potatoes cooked in poppy-seed paste. Now, her mind turned to her shrine room again: with the hour of the noontime puja drawing close, it was time to go down to the river for a bath. After massaging poppy-seed oil into Kabutri&#x2019;s hair and her own, Deeti draped her spare sari over her shoulder and led her daughter towards the water, across the field.</p><p>The poppies ended at a sandbank that sloped gently down to the Ganga; warmed by the sun, the sand was hot enough to sting the soles of their bare feet. The burden of motherly decorum slipped suddenly off Deeti&#x2019;s bowed shoulders and she began to run after her daughter, who had skipped on ahead. A pace or two from the water&#x2019;s edge, they shouted an invocation to the river&#x2014;Jai Ganga Mayya ki . . . &#x2014;and gulped down a draught of air, before throwing themselves in.</p><p>They were both laughing when they came up again: it was the time of year when, after the initial shock of contact, the water soon reveals itself to be refreshingly cool. Although the full heat of summer was still several weeks away, the flow of the Ganga had already begun to dwindle. Turning in the direction of Benares, in the west, Deeti hoisted her daughter aloft, to pour out a handful of water as a tribute to the holy city. Along with the offering, a leaf flowed out of the child&#x2019;s cupped palms. They turned t...</p></p><h2>The First Man</h2><p>The unfinished manuscript of &#34;The First Man&#34; was discovered in the wreckage of car accident in which Camus died in 1960. Although it was not published for over thirty years, it was an instant bestseller when it finally appeared in 1994. The first man&#39; is Jacques Cormery, whose poverty-stricken childhood in Algiers is made bearable by his love for his silent and illiterate mother, and by the teacher who transforms his view of the world. The most autobiographical of Camus&#39;s novels, it gives profound insights into his life and the powerful themes underlying his work.</p><p>"A masterpiece...One of the most extraordinary evocations of childhood that exists in any language."<br>-- Boston Globe<p>"Serves as a kind of magical Rosetta stone to Camus's entire career, illuminating both his life and his work with stunning candor and passion."<br>-- Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times</p><p>"The most ambitious and compassionate of his books...The First Man has resurrected the author as dramatically as a revisitation."<br>-- The Nation</p>Man Albert Camus tells the story of Jacques Cormery, a boy who lived a life much like his own. Camus summons up the sights, sounds, and textures of a childhood circumscribed by poverty and a father&#39;s death yet redeemed by the austere beauty of Algeria and the boy&#39;s attachment to his nearly deaf-mute mother. The result is a moving journey through the lost landscape of youth that also discloses the wellspring of Camus&#39; aesthetic powers and moral vision.</p><h2>Rainmaking Made Simple: What Every Professional Must Know</h2><p>Rainmaking Made Simple: What Every Professional Must Know is the definitive how-to guide for professionals on growing their business.

His aim has been to convey precise information, in a simple non-technical way, that will be of interest to the amateur as well as the serious student of music. <br>The discussion begins with an explanation of the development of the human faculty of hearing. It is established that each sound can be represented by a curve. An examination of the general properties of sound-curves follows. For example, why do some sounds produce pleasure when they reach our ears and some pain? How do we retain the pleasurable qualities in the sound-curve, as it passes on from one stage of electronic equipment to another? To what extent is it possible to prevent unpleasant qualities from contaminating the curve? These and other pertinent questions on the transmission and reproduction of sound-curves are answered in a discussion of tuning-forks and pure tones. The various methods of producing sound, and the qualities of the sounds produced, are further discussed as they relate to vibrations of strings and harmonics, and vibrations of air. Harmony and discord are also considered. In the final chapters on the concert room and hearing, the discussion focuses on the transmission of sound from its source to the eardrum and from the eardrum to the brain. A general theory of acoustics is also covered as well as acoustical analyses. <br>"<i>Science and Music</i> is a rare book, as an author does not often combine very distinguished scientific abilities with musical knowledge and power of simple exposition. It will probably become a minor classic." &#x2014; <i>Manchester Guardian</i>.</p><p>This book sets out all that is relevant in the science of acoustics to the art of music.

Beginning with the Long Walk of the Navajos in 1860 and ending 30 years later with the massacre of Sioux men, women, and children at Wounded Knee in South Dakota, it tells how the American Indians lost their land and lives to a dynamically expanding white society. During these three decades, America's population doubled from 31 million to 62 million. Again and again, promises made to the Indians fell victim to the ruthlessness and greed of settlers pushing westward to make new lives. The Indians were herded off their ancestral lands into ever-shrinking reservations, and were starved and killed if they resisted. It is a truism that "history is written by the victors"; for the first time, this book described the opening of the West from the Indians' viewpoint. Accustomed to stereotypes of Indians as red savages, white Americans were shocked to read the reasoned eloquence of Indian leaders and learn of the bravery with which they and their peoples endured suffering. With meticulous research and in measured language overlaying brutal narrative, Dee Brown focused attention on a national disgrace. Still controversial but with many of its premises now accepted, <i>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</i> has sold 5 million copies around the world. Thirty years after it first broke onto the national conscience, it has lost none of its importance or emotional impact. <i>--John Stevenson</i>12 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Better Homes and Gardens Story Book</h2><p>This is the 1st edition with the mustard/yellow cover.

The part of the occult that purports to be scientific (e.g., parapsychology) requires the ability to think like a scientist and to evaluate evidence. Instead, Wilson gives many nice anecdotes, all of dubious value scientifically. These he "supports" by offering quotations from fringe scientific sources, never mentioning that most scientists don't accept them. Because there are many popular misinterpretations cited in the bibliography, Wilson's narrow speculations are ultimately built on sand. His work would have been less spectacular, but more deserving of attention, if he had based it more solidly on established facts. He writes well, and may hold the reader's interest, but what he says will do little toward unifying the occult as a serious scientific subject.<br><i>- Gordon Stein, Univ. of Rhode Island</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Wilson ( The Occult ; The Misfits ) maintains that a belief in telepathy and precognition is compatible with science, arguing that mystical and paranormal experiences involve a widening of one's ordinary field of perception. A well-documented synthesis of research into the paranormal, this lively, succinct narrative hops from ESP to mediumship, out-of-body travel, spirit possession, poltergeists, near-death visions and reincarnation. Wilson weaves in the psychic or mystical experiences of Blake, Goethe, Jung, Maupassant, Arthur Koestler, Dylan Thomas, Philip K. Dick, others. He grounds his beliefs in the theory of an "information universe," in which everything that ever happened is somehow on record, and in the view that so-called occult powers are latent in each of us as part of our unfulfilled evolutionary potential. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My First Songs</h2><p>Bestselling author/illustrator Tomie dePaola feels like singing!

Restaurant Survival Guide: The No-Diet Weight Loss Solution</h2><p><p>Americans spend more than $500 billion a year eating out, and behind each burger, turkey sandwich, and ice cream sundae is a simple decision that could help you control your weight--and your life.

With in-depth coverage of 80 of the biggest restaurant chains in the country, it arms you with the information you need to take control of your diet and sidestep the egregious calorie-landmines that are secretly sabotaging your chances of losing weight. And why would restaurants do such a thing? Because people keep buying. The top brass at any restaurant knows that the more food that goes onto the plate, the more drastically the customers will underestimate the caloric heft. That's why the average cheeseburger has 136 more calories today than it did in the 1970s and why two-thirds of the country is now overweight or obese. </p><p>Additional features in <i>Eat This, Not That!

He likes to tell how he found me on the bathroom floor with an airline ticket in one hand and a can of root beer in the other, crying my eyes out.<br><br>I prefer to start this story where it actually began&#x2014;more than a decade before the green hair incident. One hot August night in 1982, my dearest friend of all time, Penny, and I were on duty in the church nursery. Seven of the sweaty children in the nursery that Sunday evening belonged to the two of us.<br><br>I was rocking my wailing daughter when Penny, in the middle of a diaper change, turned to me. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s make a deal, Sharon. When they graduate, let&#x2019;s go somewhere. Just the two of us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where would we go?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Finland!&#x201d; she spouted.<br><br>I stopped and stared to see if she was serious. She was.<br><br>I suppose I should back up this story to when Penny and I first met. Penny and Dave were married and expecting their first child. That&#x2019;s when they started to attend our conservative little church in Chinook Springs, Washington. They joined our home Bible study and pulled up that first night on a motorcycle, wearing matching suede jackets with fringe on the arms&#x2014;but with no Bibles. Penny left her muddy boots by the front door and settled on my tattered couch as still as a tiger concealed in the brush. I&#x2019;d never had such a potentially wild person in my house before.<br><br>The next week, Penny showed up with a burlap sack stuffed with freshly dug-up iris bulbs. She asked if I had a Bible she could borrow, and our friendship was off to a tender, unconventional start. That was twenty-four years ago.<br><br>Penny and I were in each other&#x2019;s everyday lives while raising our children. Our husbands swapped tools and went fishing on Saturday mornings. Penny and I never had a fight.<br><br>Then Dave landed the job he always had wanted at a big computer company, and the Lane family packed up and moved to San Francisco.<br><br>I was lost.<br><br>For a month I cried when no one was looking. Our phone bill went into triple digits. Penny kept saying we would get together, just the two of us, but nothing ever worked out. My separation anxiety lasted for two embarrassing years.<br><br>This is where my husband picks up the story. Jeff says that out of the blue, Penny decided to go to Finland. He doesn&#x2019;t remember the part about the church nursery where the idea was hatched more than a decade before Penny put wings to her plan. Jeff says he found me curled up against the bathroom wall, staring at the ticket and guzzling root beer.<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t guzzling root beer. I&#x2019;m pretty sure I wasn&#x2019;t drinking anything.<br><br>Jeff says I was sobbing because I was in shock.<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t sobbing. I was sighing really loud. There is a difference.<br><br>Jeff likes to add a punch line here about how I dramatically pulled the towel off my head and&#x2014;ta-da!&#x2014;my hair was green.<br><br>That part, unfortunately, is true.<br><br>For almost eleven years now I&#x2019;ve listened to my dear husband&#x2019;s account of the once-in-a-lifetime trip Penny and I took to Finland in February 1993. He loves to embellish, so every time he tells it, the story morphs into something that only vaguely resembles our real adventure.<br><br>Last Friday, Jeff had our new daughter-in-law in a state of stunned silence while going on about the night Penny and I accompanied two seventy-year-old women into a Finnish sauna. Jeff said we got all steamed up and then jumped in a frozen lake.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t a lake. It was just the snow. The snow and a single star. Jeff never includes the part about the star.<br><br>I got so mad at him. As soon as everyone left, I said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you to tell stories about Finland anymore. You get it all wrong, and it&#x2019;s not even your story. It&#x2019;s my story. Penny&#x2019;s and mine.&#x201d;<br><br>A sly grin appeared on Jeff&#x2019;s face, and I immediately knew what he was thinking. He finally had succeeded in pushing me into the corner where a pad of paper and a pen had been waiting for me for years.<br><br>So here I sit, in my corner of the world, ready to tell the story the way it really happened...about how Penny and I jumped over the moon.<br><i>One<br></i><br>January 1993 <br><br><i>Oh,Penny Girl, what have you done?</i> That&#x2019;s what I was thinking when Jeff found me on the bathroom floor sighing. I truly thought Penny had gone too far this time.<br><br>For years the amazing Penny had blazed through life like a fearless comet in the vast summer night sky. I followed close behind as a cosmic DustBuster, content to collect her sparkling trail of wonder dust. Whenever Penny ignited a sentence with the words &#x201c;what if,&#x201d; she took off soaring. I found bliss in the glittering possibilities that fell over my life in those moments.<br><br>Truth be told, we rarely did any of the things Penny dreamed up for us. I didn&#x2019;t think we actually would go to Finland. I thought we would talk big, buy travel guides, discuss sensible walking shoes, and in the end, cash in the tickets.<br><br>Penny, however, never doubted this adventure.<br><br>When she sent my ticket, she wrote with a thick, black marker across the front of the FedEx mailer:<br><br>SHARON, DO NOT OPEN! CALL ME IMMEDIATELY!<br><br>Thirty-five minutes earlier I had doused my hair with a highlighting solution, and I knew I should be heading for the shower. But I went directly to the phone and dialed Penny&#x2019;s real estate office in San Francisco.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, Sharon, go ahead. Now you can open it. Read the itinerary.&#x201d;<br><br>The words, &#x201c;San Francisco, London, and Helsinki,&#x201d; tumbled from my lips.<br><br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d; Penny prodded. &#x201c;Did you notice the name on the ticket? Sharon Andrews. That&#x2019;s your ticket. We&#x2019;re going to Finland!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Penny, this is crazy!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yep! Crazy like a daisy. February 25. Pack your bags, girl! We&#x2019;re finally going to run away from home!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But Penny... &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We made a deal. You promised you would go with me to Helsinki and back. Remember?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but we were going to go after all our kids graduated. Tyler is the only one in college. It will be, what?...Eight more years before all our kids are out of the house.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly. And I can&#x2019;t wait that long. Life is too short. We need to go now.&#x201d;<br><br>I stammered and stuttered while Penny gave me instructions on obtaining a passport. By the time I hung up and dashed upstairs to the shower, the home coloring treatment had pushed my hair past summer sun highlights all the way to a disturbing autumn moss tone.<br><br>The strange part was I didn&#x2019;t have the emotional reserves left to process how I felt about my hair. I wrapped myself in the comfort of my old yellow robe and sank to the bathroom floor, staring at the airline ticket and sighing over the possibilities.<br><br>I had been on an airplane only once. I know that&#x2019;s unusual, but I led a small life. Jeff and I both grew up here in Chinook Springs, a quiet suburb in southern Washington State. We were high school sweethearts and married right after we graduated. Jeff and his brother ran a landscaping business. I was content to keep a tidy home for Jeff and our four kids. That was my life. It was a good life. I wasn&#x2019;t the kind of person who longed to see the rest of the world&#x2014;or so I thought.<br><br>When Jeff found me on the floor, the first thing he said was, &#x201c;The ticket came, huh? What do you think?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You <i>knew</i> about this?&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded and repressed that sly grin of his. &#x201c;Dave called me a couple of days ago. He said Penny wanted to surprise you.&#x201d;</p><h2>Marks of Excellence: The History and Taxonomy of Trademarks</h2><p>Finding the roots of trademarks in heraldry, potter&#39;s marks, monograms, and other such ancient devices, this book traces the history of the corporate visual lexicon and produces a taxonomy of the commercial age. An alphabetical section covers motifs from animals to waves, with short definitions and analyses beautifully complemented by daringly cropped and crisply photographed images. Pictures of this quality and interest would steal the show in most volumes, but the text stands up well to the challenge of images that gain force because of the familiarity of their subjects (corporate trademarks), and the unusual sense that the book&#39;s context lends to them. Marks of Excellence is a worthwhile exploration at the modern language of ownership.</p><p>This text covers every aspect of the trademark, its history, development, style, classification and relevance in today&#39;s world. A brief history is given of the origins of the trademark in heraldry, monograms, owner&#39;s marks and certificates of origin. The proceeding chapters explore corporate identity and communication design with an emphasis on sign theory. The core of the book is a comprehensive classification of trademarks covering name marks, abbreviations and all kinds of picture marks. This is followed by an alphabetical index of trademark themes from animals to word puzzles. The index is illustrated by a selection of the world&#39;s best trademarks - the marks of excellence from which this book takes its name. The final section of the book covers the development of trademarks over time and across the boundaries of language and space.Per Mollerup is the founder of Designlab, a leading Scandinavian consultancy in visual communication, information design and corporate identity.</p><h2>The Encyclopedia of Healing Foods</h2><p>Drawing on an abundant harvest of hard research data, the authors take readers beyond mere nutritional facts and share cutting-edge clinical discoveries on what and how foods stimulate the body&#39;s natural ability to rejuvenate and heal. Simultaneous.</p><p><b>Michael T. Murray</b>, N.D., is widely regarded as one of the world?s leading authorities on natural medicine. He has been featured on numerous television programs, including 20/20 and Dateline. He lives in Washington.<b>Chapter One: Human Nutrition: An Evolutionary Perspective</b> <p> In order to answer the question "What is a healthy diet?," it is important to first take a look at what our body is designed for. Is the human body designed to eat plant foods, animal foods, or both? Respectively, are we herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores? </p><p> While the human gastrointestinal tract is capable of digesting both plant and animal foods, there are indications that we evolved to digest primarily plant foods. Specifically, our teeth are composed of twenty molars, which are perfect for crushing and grinding plant foods, along with eight front incisors, which are well suited for biting into fruits and vegetables. Only our front four canine teeth are designed for meat eating, and our jaws swing both vertically to tear and laterally to crush, while carnivores' jaws swing only vertically. Additional evidence that supports the human body's preference for plant foods is the long length of the human intestinal tract. Carnivores typically have a short bowel, while herbivores have a bowel length proportionally comparable to humans'. </p><p> To answer the question of what humans should eat, many researchers look to other primates, such as chimpanzees, monkeys, and gorillas. These nonhuman wild primates are omnivores. They are also often described as herbivores and opportunistic carnivores in that although they eat mainly fruits and vegetables, they may also eat small animals, lizards, and eggs if given the opportunity. For example, the gorilla and the orangutan eat only 1 percent and 2 percent of animal foods as a percentage of total calories, respectively. The remainder of their diet is derived from plant foods. Since humans are between the weight of the gorilla and orangutan, it has been suggested that humans are designed to eat around 1.5 percent of their diet in the form of animal foods. However, most Americans derive well over 50 percent of their calories from animal foods. </p><p> Since wild primates fill up on wild fruit and other highly nutritious plant foods, those weighing one tenth the amount of a typical human ingest nearly ten times the level of vitamin C and much higher amounts of many other vitamins and minerals (see Table 1.1). How is this possible? One reason is that the cultivated fruit in an American supermarket is far different from the wild fruit of the primate's diet, having a slightly higher protein content and a higher content of certain essential vitamins and minerals. Cultivated fruit tends to be higher in sugars and, while very tasty to humans, it is not nearly as nutritious. In fact, it raises blood sugar levels much more quickly than its wild counterparts do. </p><p> There are other differences in the wild primate diet that are also important to highlight, such as a higher ratio of alpha-linolenic acid -- the essential omega-3 fatty acid -- to linoleic acid -- the essential omega-6 fatty acid. A higher ratio of omega-3 fatty acid decreases the likelihood of the development of inflammatory and chronic diseases as well as their severity. Finally, the wild primate diet is very high in fiber, while the average American diet is not. A high-fiber diet protects against heart disease and many types of cancer. </p><p> Determining what diet humans are best suited for may not be as simple as looking at the diet of wild primates. Humans have some significant structural and physiological differences compared to apes. The key difference may be our larger, more metabolically active brains. In fact, it has been theorized that a shift in dietary intake to more animal foods may have produced the stimulus for human brain growth. The shift itself was probably the result of limited food availability, which forced early humans to hunt grazing mammals such as antelope and gazelle. Archaeological data support this association -- humans' brains started to grow and become more developed at about the same time evidence shows an increase of animal bones being butchered with stone tools at early villages. </p><p> While improved dietary quality alone cannot fully explain why human brains grew, it definitely appears to have played a critical role. With their bigger brains, early humans were able to engage in more complex social behavior, which led to improved foraging and hunting tactics, which, in turn, led to even higher quality food intake that fostered additional brain evolution. </p><p> Data from anthropologists looking at evidence from hunter-gatherer cultures is providing much insight as to what humans are designed to eat. However, it is important to point out that these cultures were not entirely free to determine their diets. Instead, their diets were molded as a result of what was available to them. For example, the diet of the Inuit Eskimos is far different from that of the Australian Aborigines. Therefore, it may not be appropriate to answer the question "What should humans eat?" simply by looking at these studies alone. </p><p> Nonetheless, regardless of whether a hunter-gatherer community relied on animal or plant foods, the rate of diseases of civilization such as heart disease and cancers was extremely low. </p><p> How is this possible? One reason is that the meat our ancestors consumed was much different from the meat we find in the supermarket today. Domesticated animals have always had higher fat levels than their wild counterparts, but the desire for tender meat has driven the fat content of domesticated animals to 25 to 30 percent or higher compared to a fat content of less than 4 percent for free-living animals or wild game. In addition, the type of fat is considerably different. Domestic beef contains primarily saturated fats and virtually undetectable amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. In contrast, the fat of wild animals contains over five times more polyunsaturated fat per gram and has desirable amounts of beneficial omega-3 fatty acids (approximately 4 percent). </p><p> What conclusions can we draw from the evidence of the wild primate and hunter-gatherer diets about how we should eat today? Overwhelmingly, it appears that humans are better suited to a diet composed primarily of plant foods. This position is supported also by a tremendous amount of evidence showing that deviating from a predominantly plant-based diet is a major factor in the development of heart disease, cancer, strokes, arthritis, and many other chronic degenerative diseases. It is now the recommendation of many health and medical organizations that the human diet should focus primarily on plant-based foods, comprising vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. </p><p> The evidence supporting diet's role in chronic degenerative diseases is substantial. There are two basic facts linking the diet-disease connection: </p><p> 1. A diet rich in plant foods is protective against many diseases that are extremely common in Western society. </p><p> 2. A diet providing a low intake of plant foods is a causative factor in the development of these diseases and provides conditions under which other causative factors became more active. </p><p> <b>The Pioneering Work of Denis Burkitt and Hugh Trowell</b> </p><p> Much of the link between diet and chronic disease originated from the work of two medical pioneers: Denis Burkitt, M.D., and Hugh Trowell, M.D., editors of Western Diseases: Their Emergence and Prevention, first published in 1981. Although now extremely well recognized, the work of Burkitt and Trowell is actually a continuation of the landmark work of Weston A. Price, a dentist and author of Nutrition and Physical Degeneration. In the early 1900s, Dr. Price traveled the world observing changes in teeth and palate (orthodontic) structure as various cultures discarded traditional dietary practices in favor of a more "civilized" diet. Price was able to follow individuals as well as cultures over periods of twenty to forty years, and he carefully documented the onset of degenerative diseases as their diets changed. </p><p> Based on the extensive studies examining the rate of diseases in various populations (epidemiological data), including the groundbreaking work of Dr. Price and their own observations of primitive cultures, Burkitt and Trowell formulated the following sequence of events: </p><p> <b>First stage:</b> In cultures consuming a traditional diet consisting of whole, unprocessed foods, the rate of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer is quite low. </p><p> <b>Second stage:</b> Commencing with eating a more "Western" diet, there is a sharp rise in the number of individuals with obesity and diabetes. </p><p> <b>Third stage:</b> As more and more people abandon their traditional diet, conditions that were once quite rare become extremely common. </p><p> Examples of these conditions include constipation, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and appendicitis. </p><p> <b>Fourth stage:</b> Finally, with full Westernization of the diet, other chronic degenerative or potentially lethal diseases, including heart disease, cancer, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout, become extremely common. </p><p> Since the publication in Western Diseases of Burkitt and Trowell's pioneering research, a virtual landslide of data has continually verified the role of the Western diet as the key factor in virtually every chronic disease, but especially in obesity and diabetes. In 1984, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council established the Committee on Diet and Health to undertake a comprehensive analysis on diet and major chronic diseases. Their findings, as well as those of the U.S. surgeon general, the National Cancer Institute, and other highly respected medical groups brought to the forefront the need for Americans to change their eating habits to reduce their risk for chronic disease. Table 1.2 lists diseases with convincing links to a diet low in plant foods. Many of these now-common diseases were extremely rare before the twentieth century. </p><p> <b>Trends in U.S. Food Consumption</b> </p><p> During the twentieth century, food consumption patterns changed dramatically. Total dietary fat intake increased from 32 percent of calories in 1909 to 43 percent by the end of the century; carbohydrate intake dropped from 57 ...</p></p><h2>The Complete Book of Papermaking</h2><p>The entire creative process unfolds, from the fibers to use to beautiful things to make. All the technical aspects are explained in detail, with special attention to fashioning a sheet of paper, step by step. Put all this knowledge to use on ten magnificent projects, including a Palm Paper Album, a Rustic Notebook with Textured Paper, an Accordion Book, and more.<br></p><p>The ubiquity of paper has, in part, detracted from the appreciation of this medium as an art form. Thanks to a Barcelona university professor, this 1,900-year-old Chinese invention takes on a new dimension, with detailed information on and illustrations of historical forms, paper's characteristics and properties, materials and tools, fibers, and eight ready-to-emulate projects. The amount of intricacy is impressive; for example, Asuncion delves into paper's chemical composition, examining the different kinds of pulps, from wood to rag, and their treatment and uses. Although one chapter is devoted to step-by-step instructions on fabricating one sheet of paper (as well as color and collage techniques), it is still difficult to copy the directions successfully without spending an inordinate amount of time reviewing papermaking processes, especially if instructions are somewhat complicated (e.g., writing paper and envelopes made from jeans). A glossary is appended. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I was going to be rich and famous and live in New York City. I figured I would be a writer. </p><p> <b>Why a writer?</b><br> I've always written, from the time I was little. I wrote stories, fables, children's stuff. I kept journals. When I started doing foster care, I used journals with the children. </p><p> <b>How do you use journals with the children?</b><br> When kids come to me and they've been in twenty-seven different homes, they don't remember much of their past. They think they were hatched at age nine or something. What I often do is buy them a little binder notebook and say, "Tell me the first thing you remember. Who's the first person you remember living with?" If that person is not the birth mother, I will talk to the child's caseworker and see if I can learn the child's exact history. Then I will tell the child-say her name is Anna-"Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Anna. When she was born, she had a mother, whose name was Elizabeth. But Elizabeth couldn't take care of her well enough, so Anna went to live with her aunt Sally." And so on. When I'm done with the story, Anna has a picture of her past so she can write it down in her journal herself. It's a timeline. <br><br> I also use journals with teenagers. Imagine being fifteen and walking into some stranger's house, especially if you don't happen to speak English. I say to teenagers, "Tell me your story." Then, if they do, I say, "That's so interesting-this is like the best work of fiction, but it's real. Why don't you write it down?" The alternative is that they'll put on headphones and veg out for hours. <br><br> Another thing I might say to kids is, "Wow, this is how long your life has been so far, but this is how long you have left." I want to give them a sense of wide-open futures and the opportunity to make good choices from this point forward. </p><p> <b>What about you? Do you still keep a journal?</b><br> Yes. Writing helps me process things. For example, when a child first comes to me, I often write down the child's story and from that compile a list of strengths and needs. In the course of writing, I get a clearer understanding of children and their families. It puts things in a context that I can understand. I have a sense of, "Oh, now I get it. I see how this happened and who these people are in the world." It also helps me cope with some of the horror of a particular story. It's cheaper and more accessible than a therapist. <br><br> I'm not good at keeping a specific journal, though. I'll write something in one notebook, and then in another-fragments here and there. I'll write in margins of books, on napkins, backs of envelopes. I'm always saying, "Does anyone have a paper bag? I need to write something down." <br><br> My husband bought me one of those handheld tape recorders. But it's not the same. For me, writing has to be longhand. It has something to do with how I sit to write, how the words go on the paper. Writing isn't just the product, it's also the process. There's a physical side to it. </p><p> <b>Did you write this book longhand, or on a computer?</b><br> The first five drafts were handwritten. The initial part of the writing process for me always has to be handwritten. After those drafts, though, I typed the text into a computer. I still don't know how to cut and paste. I have to ask the kids. <br><br> When did you go from saying, "I want to be a writer in New York City," to, "I want to be a foster mom"? <br><br> I never said to myself, "I want to be a foster mom." That was never the plan. <br><br> My husband and I got married and had our first son. We moved to a rural environment-a town with seven hundred people, a farm in the middle of nowhere. Then we had another couple of kids. I liked having kids. I liked being a mother-baking bread, giving baths, the physical stuff. <br><br> When it was time for me to think about gainful employment, I took some classes and taught preschool. I loved being in the classroom, having children around. <br><br> Then I met my first little girl who needed a home. She's starting college next week. <br><br> There was never an epiphany moment when I said, "This is what I want to do." I slid into it. During that slide, I had moments when I said to myself, "Holy smoke! This is really interesting!" <br><br> What is it about being a foster parent that you find interesting? <br><br> I'm not a cocktail party girl. But when we do go to cocktail parties, the other guests are talking about their investments or their computers, and are probably thinking about me, "She's fifty years old and she's still home?" And what I'm thinking is, "You have no idea how interesting my life is!" <br><br> We all like to glimpse into other people's lives. I think I'm nosy by nature. It's interesting for me to see how other families work and survive. <br><br> Some families live lives about which you think: "How do they stand the trauma? I couldn't stand the trauma." But some of these families actually thrive on it. <br><br> Kids themselves are amazingly perceptive and courageous and smart. They slay me when they tell me some of their stories-fifteen moves, not knowing where they're going to be tomorrow. And yet they get up in the morning and put one foot in front of the other. How interesting is that? How lucky am I? I have the opportunity to hold their hands. <br><br> I think I've become an adrenaline junkie as far as what I do. This is real drama, complete with mysteries and heroes and villains and plot twists. I'm energized by the unexpected. </p><p> <b>Why did you write this book?</b><br> I'm a writer. A Boston Globe reporter wanted to write a book about what I do. But my husband said to me, "You write it. This is the book you want to write." <br><br> Foster parents are among the most misunderstood people in the world. There seems to be a mental picture of foster parents-we're either selfless saints, or we're leeches of society who take in children and spend government money on Cadillacs while we feed the kids macaroni and cheese, and lock them in the closet. <br><br> The truth is, I'm not a saint. I can get impatient. I don't always make the right choices. Sometimes I just want to go into my bedroom and lock the door. But I'm also not cruel and awful. In this book, I wanted to offer a more authentic and realistic public image of people who choose to do foster care. <br><br> I also wanted people to read the book and say, "I can do this." And I wanted to tell my kids' stories. There's this image of kids in foster care, that they're all hideous delinquents. And instead, so many of them are remarkable. They have sweet streaks. Even the worst kids can have sweet streaks. <br><br> I had a horrible child-difficult as can be, retarded, very aggressive and violent, sneaky, sometimes really mean. A hard kid. I thought, "What have I gotten myself into?" But when she came into the house, she looked around and said, "My God, this is like living in a party!" Just like that, as soon as her attitude changed, my attitude changed. There are moments that are quite sweet. Underneath it all, the kids are just kids. <br><br> How do you keep your equilibrium with the other people in these kids' lives-the birth parents, the caseworkers, the social workers, the attorneys? When you meet birth parents who were or are awful to the kids, are you tempted to lecture or yell at them? <br><br> I'm the sort of person who wants everyone to do what I want, yesterday. I want everyone to do what my kids want. I'm that way with attorneys and social workers and caseworkers. But not with birth parents. </p><p> <b>Why not?</b><br> These birth parents were six years old themselves once upon a time, and nobody helped them. If someone had, none of this would be happening now. <br><br> I can have long conversations in my head in which I tell a birth parent what to do. But judgment doesn't help. What I see in the birth parents is an enormous amount of pain and anger and fear. <br><br> Still, there are kinds of abuse that would blow your mind. The sexual abuse of children is incomprehensible to me, and after all these years, I'm still floored when mothers choose abusive mates over the welfare of their children. I can wrap my brain around the idea of a parent's losing it and shaking a baby or hitting a child harder than intended, but I struggle to come up with any empathy in cases of planned, systematic abuse or lack of remorse. There is neglect that comes from poverty or a parent's limitations, but I've seen parents who smoke while trying to justify not feeding their babies. </p><p> <b>What was your childhood like? Do your own experiences as a child help you now with your foster children?</b><br> Yes, there's no question. As for my childhood-there was a fair amount of good stuff with a fair amount of awful stuff. The family structure was there. I have two brothers and a sister, who are very successful now-good lives, solid marriages, nice kids. We're very tight. We all talk to at least one of the others every day. <br><br> When we were kids, we always had one another. We also always had somebody in the background-some adult-who was willing to prop us up. There was always somebody to tell us, "You are so bright." My mother felt that we were smart and capable. I realize that I might be that person for my kids. </p><p> <b>What role does your husband play in your kids' lives?</b><br> Bruce feels very strongly that he's often the only normal guy that my little girls and my adolescent girls ever see. He's so good with them. He says, "I'm the only book they're going to read on what a guy should be like." <br><br> Last night, he was washing the dishes after working a nine-hour day. I had started to do them, but he said, "No, I want you to take a swim. I can do this in ten minutes." Isn't that a good message for the kids? <br><br> Bruce feels it's important for the kids to see a man who can be patient and kind and nurturing. Even if he and I get annoyed with the kids, we rarely lose our tempers. When we find ourselves not working well with a child, we usually ask to have the child moved rather than risk not meeting the child's needs. We are both pretty good at realizing that children use behaviors to express their feelings, so we don't take things personally. <br><br> If the kids are getting to us, Bruce and I will give ourselves a time-out. I figure that God invented The Lion King to give parents an hour of peace and quiet. </p><p> <b>It can be hard enough balancing marriage with conventional parenthood. What is it like balancing marriage with foster parenthood?</b><br> That's another message we give to our kids-that Bruce and I need to have our time together. We guard that time. We're not opposed to telling the kids that they need to find something to do at certain times. <br><br> Bruce and I find time alone. We're hedonistic about it. We have coffee together on the deck every morning. And every night, we have coffee, tea, or a drink and sit on the deck. Most nights, if the weather is good, we're in the pool at ten, eleven o'clock. We call it our "sacred spot." The kids know they're not allowed there unless their hair's on fire. This gives Bruce and me enough energy to face the next challenge. <br><br> He and I have a standing Thursday-night date. We don't do anything spectacular. Sometimes we'll get a bottle of wine and rent a movie or play cards. We might just watch television or look at the stars. What we do isn't important, but the time alone together is. We don't even answer the phone. It's wonderful. </p><p> <b>If you had a weekend to yourself-no kids, no husband, no obligations-what would you do?</b><br> I would get homesick. My home is my favorite place to be. I'm on the go so much with the kids that I cherish an uninterrupted hour sitting on my deck, watching the birds. If I had a weekend of uninterrupted time, I would use it to enjoy the things I already cherish-heaven for me is a cup of tea and enjoying a murder mystery in front of the fire. I love to cook, and I'm an avid reader. </p><p> <b>How many foster children do you have in your house right now?</b><br> I have four, and I'm getting two new ones this afternoon. I usually have six. Two girls went home yesterday-two adolescent girls, very different from each other. One of them we had for a year and a half. The other one, we had for a week. The first one we sent home with a whole new set of skills. She promises that she'll keep her nose clean, that she's going to do the right thing. She's an A student, beautiful, smart. We spent the last three months talking about choices, how her life depends on making good ones. I told her, "If you make good choices, your life can be whatever you choose it to be." It was different with the other girl, the one I had for only a week. I had the same conversation with her, but delayed and condensed. I told her, Your life may seem like it's over, but it doesn't have to be this way." She said, "All I want is for my life to be normal. I want a normal life where I get up, someone makes me breakfast, someone's there, and there's no violence. That's what I want my dad to give me." Her whole life to this point has been nothing but violence. <br><br> I told her, "I don't think that's going to happen. But there's a choice you can make here. You can say, 'I'm going to stay away from violent men. I'm going to make my best efforts in school and always do my homework.'" <br><br> If kids did their homework, a lot of them wouldn't have so many problems. I'm very strict about this. Life is not fun around my house if you don't do your homework! </p><p> <b>What is the hardest part about being a foster mom?</b><br> I usually know exactly what a child needs after a while-better than the child's therapist or social worker. But it's very frustrating for me when I can't obtain those things. It's difficult to have to say, time and time again, "This is what this kid needs, so why can't she have it? Really, what would it cost?" </p><p> <b>Is funding for social services getting better or worse?</b><br> Things are getting worse. Caseworker numbers are way down. It used to be that you could always get a caseworker, but now you can't. <br><br> Since 9/11, funding for everything has been cut. There used to be a program called Parenting Partners. When I had a child in care who was ready to go home, I would be available to the child's mother as a support person. I could do things that social workers rarely have time to do. I could work on parenting skills and household management and provide some respite child-care. In effect, I could be a parent figure to the parent. At ten dollars an hour, I was a bargain. Unfortunately, the program was defunded, and that safety net disappeared. </p><p> <b>Is lack of funding the only problem at the institutional level? Are poor planning or bad decision making also problems?</b><br> Yes. For example, we know that adolescents don't do well in foster homes. There's an intimacy involved that's hard for them. What they really need are small, structured group homes-four to six kids, rotating house parents, one set of mom an...</p>Kathy Harrison has been a foster parent to nearly one hundred children.

The answers may surprise you.<p>Through touching true stories and inspiring insight Debbie Macomber takes readers on a journey to discover the shaping influence others have on us and the power we have to shape and influence those whose paths cross ours.</p><p>Each of us have &#x201c;influencers&#x201d; that have affected our lives&#x2014;some from a distance, some through word or deed, some through example, be it good or bad. Often we don&#x2019;t even recognize the deep impact others have had and how God has used them to shape us into who we are. By pausing to recognize these influences we begin to grasp how God&#x2019;s guest list had a purpose far beyond what we imagined. We begin to see the seeds of influence that grew into our personal values and character.</p><p>In some people God invites into our lives, we see only what appears to be painful or negative influence. We bear the scars of disappointment, hurt, betrayal, and pain. Here Macomber redirects our attention, opening our eyes to how those experiences prompted strength, resilience, resolve, decisions, and choices about how we would change and who we would become. In other instances, God has surprised us with just the people at just the right time to support, teach, lead, or love us, but perhaps we haven't quite recognized God's timing and work through these "guests."</p><p>But perhaps the greatest treasure this book holds is the power to grasp our own power to influence others, and even to anticipate what lives we have yet to touch. In the tradition of <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People, </i>Macomber casts a vision to seize every opportunity to be a positive and faithful influence on others. With this realization comes the willingness and anticipation to live with the door of our lives wide open to greet each new life God brings across the threshold.</p><p><i>God's Guest List </i>is filled with true stories and rich insight that will forever change how you see the people in your life.</p></p><p><b>Debbie Macomber </b>is one of today&#x2019;s leading voices in women&#x2019;s fiction.

But when you are ready, I&#x2019;ll take you on a tour of heaven.&#x201d;</p><p>When the time came for her tour, she could hardly take it all in. It reminded her a little of her earthly home, but she could see that earth had only been a pale shadow of what she was seeing now. They explored every nook and cranny of heaven&#x2014;waterfalls, fields of flowers, exquisite buildings, and streets of gold.</p><p>As the tour drew to an end, she noticed one massive door they had not yet explored. A gold padlock secured it. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s in that room?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to see that room,&#x201d; St. Peter said, steering her away from it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only a storeroom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I do. May I see inside? I want to see every bit of heaven.&#x201d;</p><p>St. Peter didn&#x2019;t answer. Instead he took a large key out of his pocket, put it in the lock, and turned it. The tumblers clicked and the padlock opened. He took the lock off and opened the door. The woman had to blink several times to take it all in. Inside the cavernous room were stacks and stacks of gifts, wrapped in all the colors of the rainbow and tied with all the colors of heaven.</p><p>She clapped her hands with delight. &#x201c;Is this where you store presents for everyone in heaven?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. These gifts are not for heaven, they were meant for earth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean &#x2018;were&#x2019;?&#x201d; She walked through the stacks and came to a pile marked with her name. &#x201c;Look, these gifts are for me.&#x201d; She fingered the paper and ribbons. &#x201c;May I open them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. You don&#x2019;t need them now.&#x201d; St. Peter put a hand on her shoulder, guiding her toward the door.</p><p>&#x201c;But if I don&#x2019;t need them <i>now</i>, does that mean I needed them on earth?&#x201d; She couldn&#x2019;t take her eyes off the pile. To think she would never get to enjoy all those beautifully wrapped gifts.</p><p>He nodded his head. &#x201c;Yes, you needed them on earth.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked around the room, realizing that there must have been millions of gifts. Maybe more, since she couldn&#x2019;t see an end to the room. &#x201c;Why weren&#x2019;t my gifts sent to me on earth?&#x201d; As she looked closer, she could read names on all the gifts. &#x201c;Not just my gifts; why haven&#x2019;t any of these gifts been sent?&#x201d;</p><p>St. Peter sighed. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand. Every one of them was sent.&#x201d; Moving his arm in an arc that encompassed the whole room, he said, &#x201c;All of these and more. These are the ones that were returned unopened.&#x201d; He moved her toward the door. &#x201c;Many people on earth don&#x2019;t recognize God&#x2019;s gifts and fail to open them.&#x201d;</p><p>I love gifts&#x2014;both giving and receiving. When I first heard this story, I wondered if there was any truth to the parable. Had God sent gifts to me that I hadn&#x2019;t opened? When I get to heaven, I don&#x2019;t want to discover that I failed to recognize the gifts God sent into my life. I don&#x2019;t want to miss a single one.</p><p>Unfortunately, in real life God&#x2019;s presents don&#x2019;t always come gaily gift-wrapped, and they are not always easily recognized. Some even initially come looking like challenges. And often these gifts are people shaped.</p><p>THE SECOND LIST</p><p>If you&#x2019;ve read any of my nonfiction books, you know I&#x2019;m a list maker. Goals, objectives, tasks. They all go on lists. Socrates said, &#x201c;The unexamined life is not worth living.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve taken his advice to heart and take a careful look at my life day by day in order to make the most of my time and efforts.</p><p>Many years ago I read <i>The Aladdin Factor</i> by Jack Canfield, who coauthored the Chicken Soup series. This was before that series was as well known as it is now. The one thing I remember most about that book was something Jack Canfield wrote. He made a list of thirty people he wanted to meet in his life. Entertainers, authors, musicians&#x2014;people whose work he deeply admired and whom he wanted to thank.</p><p>What an idea!</p><p>It inspired me, and I set about making a list of my own&#x2014;thirty people I wanted to meet. I started out with Pat Conroy&#x2014;one of the most gifted writers of our time. The list was filled with people I&#x2019;d admired throughout my life&#x2014;writers, musicians, speakers, and others. At the time, the possibility of meeting those on my list seemed impossible, but one by one God brought them into my life, and I gratefully checked them off my list, one by one.</p><p>A few years ago I attended a writers&#x2019; conference. An author from my list whom I&#x2019;d long admired was to be the keynote speaker. I wanted to tell him the story of how I came to find him and how his writing had inspired me, so it was arranged for us to meet and talk. We sat in a quiet corner of the hotel lobby and I began to tell him what his work has meant to me. Halfway through the story, he stopped me. &#x201c;Just a minute. You have to stop, because I need to bask.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s B-A-S-K&#x2014;bask. I didn&#x2019;t know what he meant until he closed his eyes and began to breathe deeply through his nose. He waved his hands as if to fan my words toward him and got a weird look on his face as he appeared to soak in my words of encouragement.</p><p>It was all I could do to keep from bursting out laughing. That someone would need to bask in the glory of a simple compliment flabbergasted me. Long after that conference was over, I continued to think about that incident. It was so odd. The more I thought about it, the more disappointed I became in this person. I had held him in such high regard. How could I have been so wrong? Instead of reflecting any glory back to God, this author chose to absorb it for himself. To bask in my praise.</p><p>The sad thing is that he wasn&#x2019;t the only one from my list who turned out to be a disappointment. I had listed a well-known, much-loved singer with a career history that spans forty years. The lyrics he sings are so beautiful and touch me deeply, but I came to find out they&#x2019;re lyrics written by other people. It soon became obvious that he was so plastic, so saccharine, that if I had met him in any other circumstance, I confess I would have automatically avoided him. His world revolved around him. Because people had kowtowed to him for so long, he had no patience. His frustration threshold was dangerously low. I watched as he snapped his fingers at people, signaling them to bring him things. It was cringe-worthy. Even more telling, his annoyance and rudeness turned to smiles the moment someone lifted a camera in his direction. Sad.</p><p>During my morning prayer time, shortly after my visit with the author at the writers&#x2019; conference, I found myself telling God how disillusioned I was with so many of the people on my list. It didn&#x2019;t take too many disappointments to conclude that unless the person stayed God-centered, fame and talent seemed to ruin the person in some way. Basking in their own accomplishments led to self-absorption and self-obsession. Many of them didn&#x2019;t even seem to see other people. So that morning I complained to God how disappointed I was in several of the people on my list. Then it hit me. My disappointment stemmed not from the fact that these people were flawed. We are all flawed. The true source of my disappointment was that I had misplaced my admiration.</p><p>As I prayed, I sensed that God was saying, <i>There is a reason I had that happen, Debbie. It&#x2019;s because I want you to make another list. You asked Me to send those thirty people into your life. You&#x2019;re My daughter. I love you, and as your Father, I want to give you the things that you ask for, but I also wanted you to see people through My eyes. Now make another list and put down thirty more spaces, but leave them open for the people I want to send into your life.</i></p><p>God would send people into my life? An open list. A guest list. It was as if He had issued invitations to my life and asked me to watch for the people He would be sending.</p><p>What a concept!</p><p>Knowing that God had already compiled a guest list filled me with anticipation&#x2014;a sense of discovery. From that point on I&#x2019;ve looked deeply into each face I meet. Could this be one of the guests God invited into my life? Little by little, I&#x2019;ve been filling in those spaces on that list. And you know what? I have yet to be disappointed with God&#x2019;s guest list for my life.</p><p>This list has become one of the most important lists in my life. I call it God&#x2019;s guest list. Though I arbitrarily started with thirty blanks, a finite number unnecessarily limits this list. God&#x2019;s guest list for my life is meant to be lived out as an open invitation, welcoming those whom God sends our way.</p><p>I know that God is sovereign. He sends every person we meet into our lives, but I&#x2019;m talking about a list of special guests&#x2014;the ones who have changed us, or who will change us, in some significant way. They don&#x2019;t necessarily have to be our closest friends. Sometimes you&#x2019;ll read something by someone that affects you deeply. You may never even meet that person, but you discover that God sent him or her into your life.</p><p>One of my friends has been deeply affected by the writings of C. S. Lewis. He died when she was only a child, but the things she learned from Lewis have forever changed her. If she were making her list, Lewis would certainly be on it even though she will never meet him this side of heaven.</p><p>Recognizing those who will influence us is no easy task. Sometimes we meet someone and are immediately drawn to that person, confident that he or she may very well be an important part of our life. We might even seek someone out. And at times we may even feel like our life has been invaded by som...</p></p><h2>Stamboul Train: An Entertainment (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)</h2><p>Published in 1932, this spy thriller unfolds aboard the Orient Express as it crosses Europe from Ostend to Constantinople. Weaving a web of subterfuge, murder and politics along the way, it focuses upon the disturbing relationship between Myatt, the pragmatic Jew, and chorus girl, Coral Musker.</p><p>Greene classified this 1932 novel as one of his "entertainments" to distinguish it from his more serious works. Set on the Orient Express, traveling from Ostend to Constantinople, the story features a varied cast, including a wealthy Jewish merchant, a chorus girl, a burglar turned murderer, an exiled nationalist/revolutionary, and assorted other passengers. Michael Maloney manages the multinational voices, effectively conveying the wide range of emotions in this tale on intrigue and subterfuge. The reading keeps the listener focused on what will happen next. An excellent performance. R.E.K. � AudioFile 2001, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i>This novel spins the tale of an assortment of well-drawn characters interacting against a background of intrigue, murder, sex, and treachery as they ride the Orient Express from Ostend to Constantinople. The setting lends a sense of urgency and tension to the action, as well as a sort of glamour associated with the famous train. Described by Greene as an "entertainment," a term he coined to differentiate his melodramatic works from his more serious novels (he later abandoned the separation), this absorbing thriller will be a popular addition to any fiction collection. Reader Michael Maloney has an astonishing range of voices and emotions, and even the most desultory listener will be drawn into the action and the psyches of the various players.

Understanding through seeing only seems to be an obviously intuitive process. Actually, developing the visual sense is something like learning a language, with its own special alphabet, lexicon, and syntax. People find it necessary to be verbally literate whether they are "writers": or not; they should find it equally necessary to be visually literate, "artists" or not.This primer is designed to teach students the interconnected arts of visual communication. The subject is presented, not as a foreign language, but as a native one that the student "knows" but cannot yet "read." The analogy provides a useful teaching method, in part because it is not overworked or too rigorously applied. This method of learning to see and read visual data has already been proved in practice, in settings ranging from Harlem to suburbia.Appropriately, the book makes some of its most telling points through visual means. Numerous illustrated examples are employed to clarify the basic elements of design (teach an alphabet), to show how they are used in simple syntactic combinations ("See Jane run."), and finally, to present the meaningful synthesis of visual information that is a finished work of art (the apprehension of poetry...).</p></p><p></p><h2>Thunder Point</h2><p>Saved from a Yugoslavian firing squad by his old nemesis, Brigadier Charles Ferguson, terrorist Sean Dillon agrees to help the British government prevent the secrets from a Nazi diary from being revealed.</p><p>Since The Eagle Has Landed&#x2014;one of the biggest-selling thrillers of all time&#x2014;every novel Jack Higgins has written has become an international bestseller. He has had simultaneous number-one bestsellers in hardcover and paperback, and many of his books have been made into successful movies, including The Eagle Has Landed, To Catch a King, On Dangerous Ground, Eye of the Storm, and Thunder Point. He has degrees in sociology, social psychology, and economics from the University of London, and a doctorate in media from Leeds Metropolitan University. A fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and an expert scuba diver and marksman, Higgins lives in Jersey on the Channel Islands.In this thrilling tale that combines World War II espionage with contemporary politics, Higgins proposes that Nazi lieutenant Martin Bormann escaped Allied forces in 1945 and made his way in a U-boat to South America, along with a notebook listing U.S. and British Nazi sympathizers. One of the names in the notebook happens to be the Duke of Windsor. In 1992, a diver in the Caribbean finds the wreck of the vessel, and word gets back to the British authorities that the notebook is still onboard. Irish terrorist Sean Dillon is recruited to retrieve the item, but he's not the only one interested: a notorious drug dealer with Parliamentary connections is also in on the hunt. The involving story unfolds rapidly across two continents as the rivals race to secure the momentous prize. Helped immeasurably by Dillon's fascinating character and a stylish performance by Roger Moore, the tension builds to an enthralling climax. Highly recommended.<br><i>- Jay Rozgonyi, Fairfield Univ.

In this remarkably rich and eminently readable historical account, acclaimed author Paul Strathern reconstructs a mission of conquest inspired by glory, executed in haste, and bound for disaster.<br><br>In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte, only twenty-eight, mounted the most audacious military campaign of his already spectacular career. With 335 ships, 40,000 soldiers, and a collection of scholars, artists, scientists, and inventors, he set sail for Egypt to establish an Eastern empire in emulation of Alexander the Great. Like everything Napoleon ever attempted, it was a plan marked by unquenchable ambition, heroic romanticism, and not a little madness. <br><br>Napoleon saw himself as a liberator, freeing the Egyptians from the oppression of their Mameluke overlords.

Instead Napoleon and his men would face a grim war of attrition against an ad hoc army of Muslims led by the feared Murad Bey. Marching across seemingly endless deserts in the shadow of the pyramids, suffering extremes of heat and thirst, and pushed to the limits of human endurance, they would be plagued by mirages, suicides, and the constant threat of ambush. A crusade begun in honor and intended for glory would degenerate toward chaos and atrocity.<br><br>But Napoleon&#x2019;s grand failure in Egypt also yielded vast treasures of knowledge about a culture largely lost to the West, and through the recovery of artifacts like the Rosetta Stone, it prepared the way for the translation of hieroglyphics and modern Egyptology. And it tempered the complex leader who believed it his destiny to conquer the world. <br><br>A story of war, adventure, politics, and a clash of cultures, Paul Strathern&#x2019;s <b>Napoleon in Egypt</b> is history at once relevant and impossible to put down.</p><p>Paul Strathern studied philosophy at Trinity College, Dublin. He has lectured in philosophy and mathematics and is a Somerset Maugham Prize&#x2013;winning novelist. He is the bestselling author of several books of nonfiction, including the series <i>Philosophers in 90 Minutes</i> and <i>The Big Idea: Scientists Who Changed the World. </i><i>Chapter One<br>The Origins of the Egyptian Campaign</i><br><br>Since earliest times, Egypt had been a source of wonder to the European eye. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus, visiting the country in the mid fifth century BC, encountered the following scene: "During the flooding of the Nile only the towns are visible, rising above the surface of the water like the scattered islands of the Aegean Sea. While the inundation continues, boats no longer keep to the channels and rivers, but sail across the fields and plains. On a journey far inland you can even sail past the pyramids." Less than two centuries later, the Macedonian Greek Alexander the Great conquered Egypt, completing this task in a matter of months, but remaining long enough to found the city of Alexandria, whose site he selected in 331 BC at what was then the western mouth of the Nile delta. After this, in what appeared to be a characteristic act of hubris, but was in fact an attempt to win over the local priesthood, Alexander sacrificed to the sacred bull Apis and had himself crowned pharaoh. He then set off east on his campaign of conquest against the Persians, during which he planted the seeds of Greek culture across a great swath of Asia. Eight years later, having extended his conquests to the limits of the known world, Alexander died after a drinking bout in Babylon, and his body was brought back to Alexandria to be buried in a magnificent tomb, made of gold and glass, whose site has since been lost.<br><br>In Roman times, Egypt would become the granary of the Mediterranean world, providing over a third of the grain supplies for the entire Roman Empire. During the first century BC Alexandria would become the focus of stirring events which changed the fate of that empire, when the charms of Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, proved irresistible first to Julius Caesar and then to Mark Antony, while rivalry between these two ambitious men plunged the Roman Empire into civil war.<br><br>Under the Greeks, and then the Romans, Alexandria would become the intellectual capital of the Western world, the city that produced Euclid and educated Archimedes, its celebrated library a repository of all knowledge. It was here that Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the earth and its distance from the sun. For the latter, he used the known fact that on a certain day the sun could be seen at the foot of a deep well in Aswan 500 miles to the south, and was thus directly overhead. He then measured the length of the shadow cast by a pole in Alexandria, and thus the angle of the sun's rays there; using trigonometry, he then calculated the distance of the sun within around 5 percent of the accepted modern figure. Such was the reach and achievement of Alexandrian learning at its prime. When its library burned down in two disastrous fires, the last of which was started by zealot Christians in AD 391, the ancient world lost over half a million scrolls, and with these as much as a quarter of the knowledge and cultural heritage of Western civilization vanished forever.<br><br>French interest in Egypt began with the Seventh Crusade in the thirteenth century, led by Louis IX (who partly on account of this became known as St. Louis). In 1248 the king and over 30,000 men disembarked from 100 ships near Damietta on the Nile delta. Here they encountered the full might of the Mameluke cavalry, which inflicted on them a crushing defeat, capturing Louis and holding him to ransom.<br><br>The Mameluke cavalry was arguably the greatest war machine of the period, certainly superior to any European militia. In 1260, just ten years after the debacle of the Seventh Crusade, the Mameluke cavalry would encounter the Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan's successor at the Battle of Ayn Jalut, just north of Jerusalem. Here they put the Mongol cavalry to flight, thus destroying for the first time the myth of their invincibility. Had the Mamelukes lost this battle, the Mongols could have pressed on across North Africa into Spain, encircling Europe. Not for nothing has this victory been reckoned as one of the great turning points of history, though it passed unnoticed in the medieval world it rescued. Meanwhile, to the European mind Egypt remained for the most part a land of Biblical legend: the setting of the plague of frogs, the Nile turning to blood, and Moses' parting of the Red Sea.<br><br>Four hundred years later, the German philosopher Leibniz would approach Louis XIV with a meticulously detailed plan for a French invasion of Egypt, including details of a Suez canal to facilitate trade with the Indies. Despite such lofty foresight, Leibniz's motive was in fact down to earth and devious: his employer, the Elector of Mainz, wished to divert the Sun King from invading the German states. But Louis rejected Leibniz's idea, informing him that "since the days of St. Louis, such expeditions have gone out of fashion." The papers detailing the scheme would gather dust in the archives at Hanover after Leibniz's death. It has been suggested that Napoleon might have been inspired by these plans, but it is now certain that he had no idea of their existence until he passed through Hanover in 1803, some years after his Egyptian expedition. When they were drawn to his attention, he remarked cryptically: "This work is very curious." Nonetheless, Leibniz's plans remain relevant; his scheme represented a trend that would flourish recurrently during the ensuing centuries: namely, the European habit of exporting internal conflicts to the territories of other continents.<br><br>Despite the rejection of Leibniz's scheme, during the ensuing century France expanded its colonial empire to Canada, Louisiana, the West Indies and India. Other European powers were engaged in similar enterprises, and this soon resulted in conflict, most notably between Britain and France. Britain's growing economic and maritime power eventually tipped the balance, with rapid and disastrous effect on the French colonies. In 1761 France lost Pondicherry and trading posts on the east coast of India; in 1762-3 it was forced to cede the Louisiana Territory to the Spanish and the British; and in 1763 it lost sovereignty over its Canadian colonies to Britain. France's valuable sugar-producing colonies in the West Indies&#x2014;Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint-Dominique (Haiti)&#x2014;now looked particularly vulnerable. Mindful of this state of affairs, Louis XV's foreign minister, the Duc de Choiseul, came up with a scheme to take over Egypt in 1769, the very year Napoleon was born. Given Egypt's climate and its plentiful cheap labor, it was ideal for sugar plantations, and could easily supplant if not exceed France's imports from the West Indies. The fact that Egypt was nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, a long-term ally of France, could easily be overcome by the simple expedient of buying it from the Turks. The following year the aging Louis XV took the courtesan Madame du Barry as his mistress, de Choiseul fell from favor, and his planned introduction of retail theory into foreign policy was shelved.<br><br>Yet France's colonial situation remained under threat, and in 1776 the idea of turning Egypt into a French colony was resurrected, when the Ministry of the Navy decided to dispatch an envoy there. The man chosen was Baron Fran�ois de Tott, a Frenchman of Hungarian descent who had lived in the eastern Mediterranean for several years and had much experience of Levantine affairs. Yet this experience would prove of little avail. On his arrival in Cairo, de Tott was immediately escorted to the Citadel, the city's fortress, where he had an audience with the pasha "surrounded by all the pomp of his Vizirate." De Tott described how "the Pasha sent away the crowd which filled the hall of the Divan, [whereupon] he confided to me that there was a fermentation amongst the beys (a sure sign that a revolution was about to take place)." No sooner had de Tott arrived at the French consul's house than a revolt duly erupted and he found himself barricaded in for his own safety "while the ruling beys took possession of the Citadel, forcing the Pasha with a pistol under his throat to issue an order banishing the revolters into exile . . . but the rebels, despising such vain formalities, began firing at their enemies. . . . After several days of blasting their guns, with more noise than effect, the ruling beys fled from the Citadel into Upper Egypt . . . and a new group of beys declared themselves to be in charge." Such chaos had now become a regular feature of life in Egypt, with the pasha, who was nominally the Ottoman ruler, reduced to a mere figurehead at the mercy of the beys, the ruling provincial chieftains, all of whom were members of the warrior caste of Mamelukes.<br><br>The Mamelukes had a long history in Egypt. They were originally brought into the country around 1230 by the ruling Ayyubite sultan al-Malik, who purchased 12,000 youths from Turkey to strengthen his army. The word Mameluke derives from mamluk, the Arabic for "slave" or "bought man," though in this case the latter is closer to the actuality. In a remarkably short time the imported Mamelukes had molded themselves into the fearsome fighting force encountered by Louis IX and the Seventh Crusade in 1248. Ten years later they became the major power in the land, murdering al-Malik's successor and establishing their own dynasty. At this stage they appear to have been largely Turkic&#x2014;non-Arab and non-Muslim in origin, often barely understanding Arabic. Yet curiously it was under this new dynasty that Egypt became established as the center of Arabic culture in the Muslim world, with the great Al-Azhar mosque as a beacon of learning, its medical and mathematical knowledge far outshining anything in medieval Europe. This was mainly due to the influx of refugee scholars from such places as Baghdad and Damascus, fleeing in the face of the Mongol hordes. Had the Mamelukes not defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Ayn Jalut in 1260, the Muslim world, much like medieval Europe, would not have survived.<br><br>Yet just twenty years lat...</p><h2>The Island House: A Novel</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Nancy Thayer evokes the shimmering seascape of Nantucket in a delightful novel that resonates with the heartache and hope of growing up, growing wise, and the bittersweet choices we must be brave enough to make.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Courtney Hendricks will never forget the magical summers she spent on Nantucket with her college roommate, Robin Vickerey, and Robin&#x2019;s charismatic, turbulent, larger-than-life family, in their gorgeous island house.

She lives on Nantucket.1<br><br>Courtney always took the slow ferry to Nantucket at the beginning of the summer. It was a sort of ritual for her, watching Hyannis with its docks, wharves, beach houses, and sailboats slide slowly into the background until the ship was surrounded by water, with no land in sight. It was the gentle disconnecting from the mainland that made it possible for her to let go of the real world and everything it contained. For two hours, she would sit at a window, staring out at the infinite blue sea, its white-�tipped waves, its oddly serene seabirds bobbing blithely so far from land, and in the distance, like a child&#x2019;s first drawing, a fishing trawler sputtering along with its nets sinking down and down into the mysterious watery unknown. Suddenly, Courtney would catch a glimmer along the horizon. Low and flat, it shimmered like a mirage, and as the steamship Nantucket rumbled along, an intense point of light would flash and disappear, flash and disappear&#x2014;�the first sign of Nantucket, the Great Point Light. As soon as she spotted this, Courtney would rise from her seat, walk down the aisle and push her way out through the heavy door to the bow. Here the wind whipped her hair into her face and the sun shone into her eyes and the air smelled of salt. She was almost there, and she wanted to be alert and watchful, to feel herself being borne closer and closer to the island she loved.<br><br>She was standing on the deck now, scanning the horizon for landmarks&#x2014;�the water tower, the cluster of rainbow sailboats daringly leaving the harbor, the buoys.<br><br>This year, this summer&#x2014;�this would be a time she would always remember. She was sure of that.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you been to the island before?&#x201d;<br><br>An older woman had come to join her, and stood next to her, her age-�marked hands holding tight to the railing.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, several times, actually, for about ten years,&#x201d; Courtney replied. &#x201c;And you?&#x201d;<br><br>The deeply tanned creases of the woman&#x2019;s face readjusted themselves as she smiled. &#x201c;Growing up, my family summered here. My parents left me their house, and my husband and children and I summered here. This summer our grandchildren are visiting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How lucky you are,&#x201d; Courtney said wistfully. She wanted what this woman had, she wanted to marry the man she loved and raise a great pack of children on the island.<br><br>The woman studied Courtney. &#x201c;And where do you stay when you&#x2019;re here?&#x201d;<br><br>Courtney paused before admitting, &#x201c;With the Vickereys on the cliff.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Vickereys!&#x201d; The woman stood back a pace, the better to scan Courtney up and down, appraising her. &#x201c;Are you a Vickerey?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; Courtney hurriedly assured her. &#x201c;I went to school with Robin Vickerey. We were roommates at Smith, became good friends, and I&#x2019;ve just fallen into the habit of visiting a lot.&#x201d; Even as she spoke the words, Courtney could hear the style, the blas� cadence of the Vickerey family: I&#x2019;ve just fallen into the habit&#x202f;. . . As if she were one of the Vickereys and belonged in that enormous rambling house as part of their accomplished, complicated, turbulent, family.<br><br>The older woman arched an eyebrow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say you&#x2019;re lucky, too, then. You&#x2019;re one of Susanna Vickerey&#x2019;s summer children.&#x201d;<br><br>Summer children: that was what Susanna called her four children&#x2019;s best friends who spent every summer in the Vickerey home, even though those &#x201c;children&#x201d; were adults and had been for years.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Courtney agreed happily. &#x201c;I am.&#x201d;<br><br>The first summer Courtney Hendricks spent on Nantucket, she was eighteen years old, a na�ve, book-�smart optimist who didn&#x2019;t know what the world would throw at her but was sure she could handle it.<br><br>And after all, look at what had happened: even though she was from little ol&#x2019; Emporia, Kansas, she&#x2019;d been accepted by one of the finest women&#x2019;s colleges, Smith College, in Massachusetts. Even better, best of all, her roommate was Robin Vickerey, who became Courtney&#x2019;s dearest friend.<br><br>Robin had long flaming red hair that curled like party ribbon and green eyes and adorable freckles spattered across her nose. With looks like that, you&#x2019;d think she&#x2019;d be kind of wild, but Robin was cool, calm, and collected, a quiet, studious, organized person who was a gem at stopping quarrels in the dorm. Robin and Courtney had become friends immediately. They shared the same sensibility. They were truly engrossed with their studies. They weren&#x2019;t geeks, but they didn&#x2019;t do quite as many stupid things as the other girls in their dorm. Courtney knew she was considered a goody-�goody, which she probably was. She assumed her Midwestern upbringing was responsible for that, so she was surprised to find the same kind of careful, helpful, Girl Scoutish attitude in Robin. After she came to know the entire Vickerey family, she understood why.<br><br>On a long spring weekend of their freshman year, Robin had invited Courtney to her home on Nantucket. She&#x2019;d mentioned that summer jobs as retail clerks, waitstaff, and landscapers paid outstanding money and Courtney wanted to check it out. Courtney&#x2019;s parents did all right for themselves&#x2014;�her father owned a pharmacy for which her mother did the books. But Courtney wanted to help soften the blow of college tuition and expenses. She&#x2019;d worked after school and on weekends in Emporia&#x2014;�why not work on Nantucket, where the pay was so much better? So she went along with Robin. They caught a ride to the Cape, took the fast ferry to Nantucket, and Susanna Vickerey, Robin&#x2019;s mother, met them at the boat and drove them out to &#x2019;Sconset.<br><br>When Courtney first saw where the Vickereys lived, she was dazzled. Anybody would be. It was a huge old house with lots of bedrooms, set on a bluff overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. Dr. Vickerey was a surgeon in Boston; the Vickereys kept an apartment in the Back Bay, but the family home was Nantucket. They had four children, and their house was always jam-�packed to its literal rafters with friends. The mother, Susanna, liked it that way. She said it filled her soul to have guests around. She called some of the guests her &#x201c;summer children,&#x201d; even after they turned twenty-�one.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay for the summer,&#x201d; Robin had coaxed Courtney. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s always room for one more.&#x201d;<br><br>Courtney had gone into town that Saturday afternoon and looked around. The town was sweet and old-�fashioned yet had excellent restaurants with famous chefs and fabulous clothing stores. Lots of places needed summer help. She talked to her parents, her parents talked to Robin&#x2019;s parents, and it was agreed. She went for the first summer and fit right in. She borrowed one of the Vickereys&#x2019; bikes for the ride to work and back. On rainy days, someone was always in the house and willing to drive her into town. On her days off, she went to the beach with Robin. Some nights, when the moon was full and the breeze was inviting, she and Robin wandered down to the beach parties. They drank some, but not much; it didn&#x2019;t interest them. During those years they were just as interested in curling up with a good book on their time off as partying. Or simply staying at home, lounging on the back patio, drinking lemonade, having easy lazy conversations and watching the white curtains flutter as the sea breezes blew through the open windows of the marvelous great house.<br><br>That first summer was eleven years ago. Courtney had come here every summer since then. In many ways, Nantucket felt like her second home. She had graduated from college and come here to work for the summer. She had gone to grad school in Boston for a master&#x2019;s in English literature and come here to work for the summer. She&#x2019;d gotten a job at UMKC teaching English lit and composition, and still, as an adult, for five more summers, she had returned to this island, this house, this family. She told her parents and Kansas friends it was because she made so much money working summers in Nantucket.<br><br>But this year making money wasn&#x2019;t enough of a reason for her to continue to go back East. Thank heavens it was Susanna Vickerey&#x2019;s sixtieth birthday. Courtney had to be there for that. The Vickereys were throwing a huge party, and Susanna had been so wonderful to Courtney for so many years.<br><br>But even the party wasn&#x2019;t the real reason.<br><br>James Vickerey was the real reason.<br><br>Courtney had been in love with him since she first met him eleven years ago. Since everyone in the Vickerey family seemed to know, share, and have opinions&#x2014;�which they discussed openly at the dinner table&#x2014;�about everyone else&#x2019;s secrets, Courtney had kept her feelings fiercely private. Not even Robin knew. Courtney seldom saw James, anyway. She was always working and James was often gone, backpacking in Europe when he was in college, working with a techie start-�up group in Boston after graduation.<br><br>But last year . . . Courtney gripped the ship&#x2019;s railing. After what happened between them last year, she knew she had to return to the island for one more summer.<br><br>She hadn&#x2019;t expected Monty Blackhorse to add to her confusion.<br><br>You would think, Courtney thought, that a woman as versed in literature as Courtney would not be surprised by anything that happened between a man and a woman.<br><br>You would think that any woman, no matter what she did, couldn&#x2019;t be shocked by any man if she had grown up with a father, a brother, and a male best friend.<br><br>On the other hand, on the spectrum of men and emotions, Courtney&#x2019;s father and brother were way over on the placid-�headed-�for-�comatose end. They were strong, silent men. Not mysterious. Just silent. Her father was a gruff man&#x2019;s man who came home from his pharmacy expecting dinner on the table and the television tuned to some kind of game&#x2014;�football, baseball, hockey&#x2014;�he&#x2019;d even watch the fishing channel if necessary. Her brother, Donnie, was five years older, a pharmacist working with their father and planning to take over the family business someday. He was obsessed with Legos when they were small, and as Courtney became a lover of books and literature and what Donnie called &#x201c;fussy stuff,&#x201d; what little interest Donnie had in her faded away. Now that he was a father, he&#x2019;d softened a bit, but his children were both boys whose favorite video was of monster trucks in muddy fields.<br><br>And Monty, her best Kansas male friend, had never done anything that shocked her in all the sixteen years since that first day she met him when she was trespassing on his property.<br><br>For her thirteenth birthday&#x2014;�her admittance into adolescence, although she&#x2019;d tried to convince her parents she was an adolescent the moment she hit double digits&#x2014;�her parents had given in and bought her a horse of her own. Star was a buckskin mare with a white star between her eyes. They boarded her at the Schmidts&#x2019; ranch, so until she got her own car at sixteen, she had to bike out there unless she could catch a ride. She could usually pester Donnie into driving her. Her birthday was in early May. That first summer, she had the entire summer stretching before her, day after delicious day of riding.<br><br>The first time she rode Star on the Schmidts&#x2019; land, Courtney entered the stable, Star&#x2019;s new home, and smooth-�talked and gentled the horse as she put on the blanket and saddle. Star stood at seventeen hands. Courtney might have appreciated a stepladder, but she wasn&#x2019;t going to admit it. Awkwardly, she got herself up onto the gracious old roping saddle. It was padded, with wide leather stirrups, a rocking chair of a seat. Courtney had kept Star at a gentle trot as they explored the Schmidts&#x2019; pasture, getting to know the horse, sensing how she and this horse were going to take to each other. She&#x2019;d ridden Star before, and liked her, but the horse was in a new stable, and horses could be quirky. Still, Star was seven years old. She seemed easygoing and content, no kind of diva.<br><br>The next time Courtney hoisted herself up into the saddle, she relaxed a bit. Beneath her, Star nickered and fidgeted, clearly announcing that she was bored.<br><br>Courtney nudged the buckskin horse with her knees and dug her heels into Star&#x2019;s sides, and they were off, galloping over a shimmering sea of sweet green grass. Never in her life, Courtney thought, would she experience anything to top the sheer soul-�soaring joy of galloping across a field on the back of this horse. She and Star became one creature, united by speed, motion, bliss, and on Courtney&#x2019;s part, a thrilling smidgen of terror. Star loved to run, and Courtney let her have her head. She felt the huffing of the huge animal&#x2019;s lungs beneath her, the silken glide of the powerful muscles carrying her.<br><br>In the distance, she spotted a stand of cottonwood trees. Easily jumping over a fallen white rail fence, she headed Star in their direction. As they drew closer, she saw a narrow creek winding along just a few feet from the trees. It was shady there, and Courtney was glad, because even with the temperature only in the low eighties, her clothes were sweat-�soaked from the ride. When they reached it, she reined Star in, took a moment to lean forward and pet her and whisper endearments to her. Her horse muttered and tossed her head, white saliva flying. Courtney dismounted and held the reins in her hand as Star drank from the creek.</p><h2>What Every Man Wants In A Woman / What Every Woman Wants In A Man</h2><p>Examines the top ten things that men and women look for in a marriage partner, presents real-life scenarios of specific problems from the perspective of both sexes, and stresses the need to seek God&#39;s guidance to begin anew.</p><p>Dr. John C.

The two lessons, pleasantly rendered by Charles and Burr, offer wisdom and advice about staying sexually faithful, which to these authors is the linchpin that holds people together. This bond, they say, is inseparable from other marital qualities like trust, devotion, vulnerability, and sacrifice. Appealing to the view that men should be leaders and women followers, the author promotes a social order that conforms to traditional interpretations of biblical teaching, not to views of marriage that recognize the enormous strengths and initiative that women can exercise in their marriages.

My parents struggled to feed and clothe me. Because I grew up without having much, I promised myself one day I&#x2019;d be very rich.<br><br>Decades later, I had built a successful business. I finally had what I could only dream of as a child&#x2014;a big house, fancy cars, expensive jewelry, and all the material things I could ever want.<br><br>At the height of success, I found myself under investigation for a crime I didn&#x2019;t commit. I faced the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence. All those possessions I had accumulated and cherished I was likely to lose. I had always felt I was in control of my life and my destiny. Once I was at the mercy of the legal system, I realized I was in control of nothing.<br><br>I lost my business, but I found another calling. I lost my riches, but I discovered riches of the spirit. I lost my faith in the system, but I discovered another faith&#x2014;a faith in things that never depreciate or corrode or collapse. I found faith<br>in God and the indomitable power of redemption&#x2014;for myself and for a group of incarcerated women who&#x2019;d been catastrophically abused by the system, by spouses, by parents, and by themselves.<br><br>Instead of chasing the American Dream, rehabilitating these women became my career. I learned that within each of them&#x2014;even the most terrifyingly brutal felons&#x2014;dwelled an undeniable spark of the divine.<br><br>Junkies, grifters, armed robbers, prostitutes, drunks, dealers, and murderers became my new social circle. They were former inmates of the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka, Alabama&#x2014;another monolithic bureaucracy<br>that warehoused the forgotten until they disappeared, returned, or died. Its motto could have been &#x201c;Abandon hope.&#x201d;<br><br>They became the Loveladies. In the beginning, no name would have been more improbable. In time, no name could have been more fitting.<br><br>This is my story.<br>This is their story.<br>Meet the Loveladies.<br><br>Chapter 1: Have I Lost My Mind?<br><br>Fear is faith that it won&#x2019;t work out.<br>&#x2014;Elbert Hubbard<br><br>Oh my Lord, what have I done!&#x201d; I gasped. I stared out the kitchen window as six violent criminals stomped up my driveway. Hunter, my four-year-old adopted son, stood on tiptoes trying to get a glimpse of what had me so terrified.<br><br>&#x201c;Your mama has messed up big-time,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>For the last month, I had pictured this moment time and time again&#x2014;but it had looked very different. In my imagination, the women would skip up the driveway, giggling and talking excitedly. I&#x2019;d open the door with a loud &#x201c;Welcome!&#x201d; and women would race toward me, enveloping me in big, grateful bear hugs. After they&#x2019;d thanked me profusely for being so wonderful, we&#x2019;d sit around the kitchen table, have lunch, drink tea, share laughs, and get to know each other. But these women stomping up my driveway didn&#x2019;t look like they wanted tea. They looked like they wanted blood.<br><br>Had I lost my mind?<br><br>Jeff, my husband, had predicted this. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get yourself killed, Brenda,&#x201d; he said when I first told him my plan to rehabilitate female convicts. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve had a lot of wild schemes in your life, but this is the craziest I&#x2019;ve ever heard.&#x201d; Yes, but a lot of my schemes had worked out, and besides, this was different. This time it wasn&#x2019;t about me.<br><br>Now six very scary women, just released from the roughest women&#x2019;s prison in the country, were in my driveway.<br><br>I thought I had figured it all out. After spending months helping female convicts at a work release center, I thought I understood them. I had spoken with the inmates, we had prayed together, and they had seemed genuine in their desire to turn their lives around and start over.<br><br>But now I doubted everything. How could I have been so stubborn, so driven, so foolish? How could I have put my little boy in danger?<br><br>The night before, I&#x2019;d combed through their &#x201c;jackets&#x201d;&#x2014;prison files&#x2014;and discovered with horror that the parole board wasn&#x2019;t sending me the nonviolent offenders I&#x2019;d visited at the work release center. Instead, the women who had<br>just shown up in front of my house had spent, collectively, one hundred years behind bars for crimes such as armed robbery, possession, drug dealing, prostitution, and manslaughter. I found out later that these were the hopeless cases&#x2014;cases stamped cannot be rehabilitated&#x2014;that all other programs had rejected. At the work release center, I helped women who were struggling to get their lives together. But the women coming to my home were so hardened, so dangerous, that the system had given up on them. These were not the women I had bargained for.<br><br>I was supposed to rehabilitate them? For the next nine months to a year? I wrapped my arms tight around Hunter. I should have dropped him off with the nanny, but I had been running late. My heart pounded so hard I was sure Hunter could hear it beating. I didn&#x2019;t want to scare him, so I took a breath and tried to find a portion of calm.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t that I hadn&#x2019;t prepared. I&#x2019;d hired a housemother, a cook, and a driver. I owned a six-thousand-square-foot house with seven bedrooms and six bathrooms on ten acres of property that no one lived in. Hob Hill was perfect: it would become my &#x201c;whole-way&#x201d; house for parolees as they transitioned into the real world. This is a good plan, I reassured myself.<br><br>These women would learn a skill and receive counseling, therapy, and, if need be, treatment for addiction. Since my program was faith-based, I&#x2019;d teach them about Jesus, His unconditional love, the power of faith, and the reality of redemption. Then I&#x2019;d get in my Cadillac Escalade and hightail it back to my new home in a gated community a few miles away.<br><br>I reminded myself that I was just supervising this program. You see, I&#x2019;d be able to supervise it without really getting my hands dirty. I wouldn&#x2019;t give up my whole life. This would be more a hobby than a vocation.<br><br>And this is how I&#x2019;ll be able to keep that promise I made.<br><br>Much of my family had been understandably furious with me for pressing forward with my plan, but Melinda, my twenty-eight-year-old, caught my passion and crazy vision. She and I had spent the last month preparing for the women&#x2019;s arrival. I bought couches, chairs, and tables for the common areas and beds, comforters, dressers, and night tables for the seven bedrooms. I painted the rooms in calming colors&#x2014;blues, yellows, and every shade of purple. Each bedroom was named after a fruit of the Spirit&#x2014;joy, peace, self-control, love, patience, kindness, goodness&#x2014;which I&#x2019;d carefully painted on the bedroom doors. Each room had color-matching comforters and thick bath towels. I&#x2019;d decorated the rooms with paintings&#x2014;many of my favorite getaway, the beach&#x2014;and supplied them with empty frames so the women could fill them with photographs of their children and families.<br><br>I put the word out to churches that I was looking to hire a cook, a driver, and, most important, a housemother who would run the program in my absence. I soon found the perfect housemother&#x2014;Claudia. She was forty-eight, single,<br>big, and strong with a gruff, no-nonsense attitude. She had spent time volunteering at the work release center. When I met with her, she told me that God had called her into prison ministry and she was ready to get started.<br><br>I asked if the thought of working with female ex-cons frightened her. She laughed as if I&#x2019;d asked the most insane question. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take tigers by the tail,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;This is the work I was meant to do. I&#x2019;m not afraid. It&#x2019;s my calling. I know I am going to change lives. The Lord sent me to do this.&#x201d;<br><br>I hired Claudia on the spot. She was so excited that she hired a moving company to haul all her bedroom and living room furniture into the upstairs master suite and office area. After she surveyed her new home, she nodded. &#x201c;This is<br>where I&#x2019;m meant to be.&#x201d;<br><br>Likewise I&#x2019;d hired a cook and a driver.<br><br>I could make this work. I had to make this work. For months I&#x2019;d pleaded with the parole board to release women into my custody so I could help them get their lives back on track. I had told the board their system didn&#x2019;t work and needed an overhaul. After all, 30 percent of the women released from Alabama prisons returned to prison within the first six months.<br><br>They laughed at me. &#x201c;What do you know about rehabilitating these women?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know that giving them ten dollars and a bus ticket is just about the dumbest thing I&#x2019;ve ever heard. I know I can do better.&#x201d;<br><br>In Alabama, there were only two options for newly released prisoners: They&#x2019;d get their ten bucks and transportation back to where they committed their crimes. In a short time they&#x2019;d go back to old ways with old friends. Or they&#x2019;d spend a few weeks in a halfway house, where they&#x2019;d receive food and shelter but little else, then be put back on the street.<br><br>No matter their destination&#x2014;bus ticket home or halfway house&#x2014;once they were released, these women had one thing in common: they had no hope. And they had no hope because they couldn&#x2019;t envision a future outside of prison.<br>To me, the solution was obvious. My whole-way house would be a place where they could change their lives by learning skills and receiving counseling. We would give them a picture of a future they themselves could create, one in which they could succeed.<br><br>I have always considered myself visionary, but the parole board used a different term&#x2014;delusional. Ultimately I wore them down and they finally agreed, probably just to make me go away.<br><br>Now I realized they were trying to teach me a lesson. I was sure they were having a big laugh about it: &#x201c;I wonder if that crazy redhead is scared senseless yet. How long until she calls us to take them all back?&#x201d;<br><br>I crouched lower and squinted through the window, hoping the awnings outside shielded me from the women&#x2019;s view. My eyes landed on the scariest-looking woman I&#x2019;d ever seen in my life. Was she even a woman? With a shaved head,<br>baggy khakis, and an extra large navy-blue prison-issued polo shirt that covered her tanklike physique, she resembled a gangbanger looking for trouble. Her fists were clenched, and her eyes blazed with fury.<br><br>Why is she so angry? Doesn&#x2019;t she see how great her life is about to become? The other women were right behind her. She was the gang leader and they were her loyal followers, standing so close to each other they appeared connected&#x2014;an impenetrable wall about to storm my house. A heavyset woman who seemed devoid of the fury the rest possessed stopped to gawk at my home. Shaved Head snapped her face toward her and the woman&#x2019;s expression immediately<br>turned grim.<br><br>Ken, the driver of the van who had shuttled the women from prison to my place, opened the back of the truck. The women collected their belongings. One by one, each woman pulled out a brown paper sack with her name written large in black marker. A paper sack! These were all their possessions in the whole world!<br><br>My heart sank. What about clothes? shoes? things? I hadn&#x2019;t realized they&#x2019;d show up with next to nothing. In my naivety, I thought they&#x2019;d spend most of today unpacking their belongings.<br><br>They were almost at the door&#x2014;and I was paralyzed. Melinda, who hadn&#x2019;t been watching them through the window and had no idea what awaited her, realized I wasn&#x2019;t moving, so she headed to the door.<br><br>Dear Melinda, what have I gotten you into, and why are you so calm? Of all the people in our family, Melinda was the one who had the most personal interest in my crazy dream. To be fair, my husband Jeff couldn&#x2019;t be there at Hob Hill&#x2014;he needed to provide income for our family, and our real estate business was located more than four hours away in Gulf Shores. But Jeff, who&#x2019;d been through plenty of &#x201c;harebrained Brenda schemes&#x201d; before, was admittedly not a fan of my &#x201c;whole-way&#x201d; idea, even as he tried to be supportive of me.<br><br>Melinda was the one who, ever since she&#x2019;d been a little girl, had always been by my side. At eleven, she&#x2019;d sit next to my desk and answer the phone as I filed clients&#x2019; tax returns. When she was old enough, she worked with me. When I<br>started helping women at the work release center, she had accompanied me. She was just as passionate as I was to help women turn their lives around.<br><br>I hadn&#x2019;t mentioned to Melinda that these women might be different from the work release darlings we&#x2019;d worked with. Apprehensive as I had become from reading the files, I still held out hope that things would work out fine. But one glimpse of the crew of ex-cons who had just shown up shook me. Melinda had spent her life trusting me. Now she was an unwitting partner in my crazy scheme.<br><br>She opened the door wide.<br><br>I scooted toward her. &#x201c;Welcome to my home,&#x201d; I blurted out, forcing a big smile.<br><br>The women glared at me. I waited for someone to say something. Instead, they pushed into the house, squeezing through the door in one massive pile. They forced themselves past me as if I wasn&#x2019;t even there.<br><br>I wanted to stop everything and yell out an order: Get out of my house and get back in the van! Maybe I could just give them some lunch and send them off, saying this was a big mistake.<br><br>Shaved Head came so close to me I could feel her breath on my face. I squeezed Hunter.<br><br>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t gonna be no maid in a little white apron for you,&#x201d; she spat out, her voice growing louder with each word. &#x201c;What the h***&#x2019;s a g**d***** white woman gonna do with us? Lady, what kinda sh** do you think you&#x2019;re playing?&#x201d;<br><br>Sharon &#x201c;Shay&#x201d; Curry. Even though she looked different from the photo in the prison jacket (she had hair back then), I recognized her. She was a forty-five-year-old black woman who&#x2019;d been in and out of prison her whole life. She&#x2019;d done<br>it all&#x2014;armed robbery, dealing and using drugs, prostitution, attempted murder. Dear God, attempted murder!<br><br>Shay&#x2019;s nostrils flared and her eyes bore into me. I watched the other women study her. I could tell they were taking their cues from Shay. In the short time they&#x2019;d been together&#x2014;probably since the van ride over&#x2014;Shay had become the<br>unofficial ringleader.<br><br>I knew if I didn&#x2019;t win Shay over there would be no way to right this ship.<br><br>Where was Claudia? She&#x2019;d been watching as the van pulled into my driveway, but I had no idea where she&#x2019;d gone. It was her job to get the women settled into their rooms&#x2014;not mine or Melinda&#x2019;s. Claudia, I told myself, would get the<br>situation under control. She&#x2019;d know how to handle Shay.<br><br>I took a deep breath, finally answering Shay, speaking as calmly as possible: &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m gonna help you get your life in order.&#x201d;<br><br>As soon as the words slipped out, I knew I&#x2019;d made a mistake.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know sh** about me, lady,&#x201d; Shay hissed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just some crazy white lady. How the h*** do you think you&#x2019;re gonna do that? What do you think you&#x2019;re going to do for me?&#x201d;<br><br>My chest tightened and I felt dizzy. I scanned the room, searching for Claudia. The truth was, I didn&#x2019;t have any plans beyond getting these women into the house and introducing myself. In prison, every second of the day is scheduled. I<br>had wanted to give the women a little breathing room. But already Shay was in my face, angrily demanding answers.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you think you&#x2019;re gonna do, lady?&#x201d;<br><br>I panicked and said just about the stupidest thing I could ever say: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to help you get your driver&#x2019;s license.&#x201d;<br><br>The women burst into laughter.<br><br>Shay looked like she&#x2019;d just bit into something so vile she might be sick. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been driving my whole life, lady. I don&#x2019;t need no driver&#x2019;s license.&#x201d;<br><br>And then I said the second dumbest thing I could possibly say: &#x201c;Well, how do you get insurance without a license?&#x201d;<br><br>There was another fit of laughte...</p><h2>The Value of Laughter: The Story of Lucille Ball (Value Tales)</h2><p>Most of the ValueTales books are out of print.

Reprint.</p><p><p>Jennifer Chiaverini lives with her husband and two sons in Madison, Wisconsin. In addition to the six volumes in the Elm Creek Quilts series and two books of quilt patterns inspired by the novels, she designs the Elm Creek Quilts fabric line from Red Rooster Fabrics.</p><b>Chapter One</b><br><br>When her sister, Claudia, died childless at the age of seventy-seven, Sylvia Bergstrom Compson became the last living descendant of Hans and Anneke Bergstrom and the sole heir to what remained of their fortune. Or so she had thought. She had certainly searched long and hard enough for someone else who could assume responsibility of Elm Creek Manor, for as difficult as it was to believe now, at the time she had thought the estate in rural central Pennsylvania too full of unhappy memories to become her home again. Her lawyer had told her she was the sole heir, an opinion corroborated by her private detective.<br><br>Now she wondered if they had overlooked something, a familial connection lost to memory but documented in a threadbare antique quilt.<br><br>She had never seen the quilt before; that much she knew to be true. She saw it for the first time after a speaking engagement for the Silver Lake Quilters' Guild in South Carolina. One woman had stayed behind to help Sylvia and her companion, Andrew Cooper, pack up Sylvia's lecture materials. As the three folded Sylvia's quilts and placed her slides carefully into boxes, the woman introduced herself as Margaret Alden and said that they had met before, for she was a former camper.<br><br>"Of course I remember you," Sylvia declared, but after a skeptical look from Andrew, she confessed otherwise. Margaret laughed and said she understood completely. So many quilters attended Elm Creek Quilt Camp each year that it was impossible to remember every one, although Sylvia felt that she ought to at least try. The campers were, after all, guests in her own home.<br><br>They chatted about quilt camp as they carried Sylvia's lecture materials to Andrew's motor home, but even after Sylvia thanked her for the help, Margaret lingered. "If you could spare me another few minutes," she said, "I'd like to show you a quilt. It's been in my family for generations, but I think it might have some connection to Elm Creek Manor."<br><br>"I beg your pardon?" said Sylvia. "What sort of connection?"<br><br>"That's what I hoped you might know."<br><br>Andrew and Sylvia were eager to begin the first leg of their long drive back to central Pennsylvania, but Sylvia rarely passed up the opportunity to see a quilt, and certainly couldn't resist seeing one so intriguingly described. Margaret hurried to her car and returned carrying a bundle wrapped in a cotton bedsheet. With Sylvia's assistance, she unfolded it to reveal a quilt -- or rather, what remained of one.<br><br>The pattern caught Sylvia's eye first: Birds in the Air blocks, each a square divided along the diagonal, a solid right triangle of medium or dark fabric on one side, three small right triangles surrounded by lighter background fabrics on the other. The blocks were arranged on point so that all the right angles of the triangles, large and small, pointed in the same direction. The fabrics themselves seemed to be primarily muslins and wools, so faded and worn that Sylvia could only guess their original colors. Water stains and deterioration suggested age as well as rough handling, as did the muted colors of the once bright dyes and the worn binding, through which the cotton batting was visible. Fine stipple quilting held the three layers together -- where they <i>were</i> still held together. Elsewhere, the thread had been removed or torn out by accident, and the middle batting layer it should have held in place was long gone.<br><br>Only a reluctance to appear hypocritical prevented Sylvia from scolding Margaret for risking further damage to the quilt by bringing it to the quilt guild meeting, for Sylvia was very glad to see it. "It's lovely, dear." She bent closer and peered through her bifocals at the quilting stitches. There was something unusual about them, something she couldn't yet place.<br><br>"Lovely?" Margaret laughed. "Most people look at it and say, "'Hmm. Interesting.'"<br><br>"You can tell Sylvia's a true quilter," said Andrew. "She never fails to see through the wear and tear and find the beauty."<br><br>"True beauty stands the test of time," said Sylvia, straightening. "Although I must say it's a pity its previous owners did not take better care of it."<br><br>"I know," said Margaret apologetically. "But my mother says it was just one of many quilts her grandmother had around the house. They didn't realize they were sleeping under a family heirloom."<br><br>"Of course not. I'm not faulting you or your ancestors. I'm not one of those who believes quilts should be showpieces kept safely away from anyone's bed." Sylvia returned her gaze to the quilt. "It's a simple pattern, pieced from scraps. It wasn't intended as the family's best quilt. I'd say by using it so well, your family was acting well within the quiltmaker's wishes."<br><br>Margaret smiled, pleased. Then Andrew caught Sylvia's eye, and she was suddenly aware of how her lecture had wearied her and how long they planned to drive before stopping for the night. She couldn't imagine what possible connection the quilt could have to Elm Creek Manor, unless Margaret hoped Sylvia would buy it and display it there. Briskly, she said, "Now, were you looking for an appraisal of the quilt or an estimate of its age? If so, I'm afraid I can't help you. I could place it in the mid- to late nineteenth century, but you'll need to consult a textiles expert for a more precise answer. As for what it's worth in terms of dollars and cents -- "<br><br>"Oh, I could never sell it," said Margaret, shocked.<br><br>"I'm pleased to hear that." Sylvia wished all families would show such appreciation for the heirloom quilts their foremothers had so lovingly made. "Then tell me, what did you mean by a connection between this quilt and my home?"<br><br>Margaret turned the quilt so that only the solid muslin backing was visible. "When you look at the quilting stitches, what do you see?"<br><br>Pursing her lips, Sylvia carefully scrutinized the quilt. Without the distraction of color and pattern, the stitches were more clearly visible. "The stippling pattern isn't consistent," she said. "Some of the stitches are long, others quite small, and the small ones seem to be grouped together."<br><br>Margaret's nod told Sylvia she had responded just as the younger woman had hoped. "When I told my mother I had attended quilt camp at Elm Creek Manor, she told me that she had an old family quilt her grandmother had called the Elm Creek Quilt."<br><br>Sylvia looked up in surprise. "Did she, indeed?"<br><br>"At first I thought its name came from the quilting pattern used in the border. See the elm leaf motif, and how these wavy lines look like running water?"<br><br>"I suppose." Sylvia saw the leaves now that they had been pointed out, but in her opinion, the wavy lines resembled a common cable pattern more than a creek.<br><br>"It had another name, too. The Runaway Quilt."<br><br>"Runaway?" Andrew chuckled. "I've heard of quilters getting carried away with their work, but I didn't know a quilt could actually run away."<br><br>"Perhaps the quilt turned out much larger than its maker had intended," said Sylvia. "Perhaps she felt it ran on and on, with a life of its own."<br><br>"Maybe, but my mother says it was most often called the Elm Creek Quilt," said Margaret hastily.<br><br>Sylvia nodded and exchanged an amused glance with Andrew. Margaret seemed most eager to prove her point, but she had said nothing yet to persuade Sylvia.<br><br>"Now look at these designs." Margaret pointed out groups of stitches that she said resembled, in turn, a tobacco leaf, a star, a mountain pass, a group of horses -- <br><br>"And these," said Margaret, watching Sylvia expectantly, "form a picture of Elm Creek Manor."<br><br>Sylvia could no longer nod politely at the woman's wild imaginings. "I'm sorry, dear. I just don't see it."<br><br>"Remember the quilter was working from the other side," said Andrew, more mindful of Margaret's feelings than Sylvia had been. "The designs would be in reverse."<br><br>Sylvia carefully unfurled the quilt before the motor home's full-length mirror and studied one small section near the top. To her amazement, the reflection revealed a perfect outline of a pass between several low mountains.<br><br>She stared at the quilt, speechless. "My goodness," she finally managed. "I must admit, that bears a striking resemblance to the pass into the Elm Creek Valley." She held up another section. "This could indeed be the west wing of Elm Creek Manor."<br><br>"You told us at camp that the west wing predates the rest of your home," said Margaret.<br><br>"It would have been the only part standing at the time this quilt was made." Sylvia traced the design with a fingertip. "The original entrance is in the proper place."<br><br>"So it's a side view now," said Andrew. "But back then -- "<br><br>"This would have been the front view of the house." Sylvia shook her head, is if to clear it of nonsense. "I admit I'm tempted to believe there's some connection, but I'm afraid it's all a bit too fanciful for me. Many houses share a similar design, and elm trees and creeks are hardly exclusive to my family's estate..."<br><br>Her voice trailed off in disbelief.<br><br>Not far from the image of Elm Creek Manor appeared the outline of another building, one so unique and remarkable that there could be no mistaking it: a two-story barn, partially concealed by the slope of the hill into which it was built, exact in proportion and scale to the barn on the grounds of Sylvia's estate.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Andrew photographed the quilt, front and back, with close-ups of the quilted images, while Sylvia recorded Margaret's memories. Margaret surmised, based upon family stories, that her grandmother's grandmother had sewn the quilt, but the five years Margaret had spent researching her family's genealogy had turned up little information from that era, since many important documents had been destroyed during the Civil War. Then Margaret added, almost as an aside, "If my grandmother's grandmother didn't make the quilt, I suppose one of her slaves could have."<br><br>"Her slaves?" echoed Sylvia. "Goodness. Your family owned slaves?"<br><br>"Yes," said Margaret, "but you don't have to look at me like that. I never owned any."<br><br>"My apologies, dear. I didn't mean to be rude." Sylvia composed herself. Of course, she had probably met the descendants of slave owners before, just as she had certainly met the descendants of slaves. It was just unexpected to hear someone admit to one's ancestors' moral failings with such nonchalance, especially since Sylvia's family had treated their forebears with respect bordering on reverence.<br><br>"It seems to me, the person who made this quilt must have seen Elm Creek Manor," said Margaret.<br><br>"Could be she was recording memories of a visit," said Andrew.<br><br>"I suppose there's no way to know for certain." Sylvia gazed at the sections of the quilt where the thread had been removed. What patterns would they have found within those stitches?<br><br>"Sylvia," asked Margaret. "Did any of your ancestors leave the family estate and move South?"<br><br>"Do you mean to say you think our families might be related?"<br><br>"I think it's possible. I had hoped your family records would be more complete than mine."<br><br>"I suppose it's not entirely unlikely. My cousin Elizabeth left Elm Creek Manor when I was a young girl, but she and her husband went to California..."<br><br>"Anything else?" prompted Margaret. "Someone earlier?"<br><br>Sylvia searched her memory as best she could under the circumstances. Hans and Anneke Bergstrom had come to America in the middle of the nineteenth century, but Sylvia did not know the precise date. She knew they had had several children, but she could not recall how many had survived to adulthood. Surely some of them must have left to start families and households of their own, but if one of them was indeed Margaret's ancestor -- <br><br>"I'm afraid I just don't know," said Sylvia, and lowered herself into a nearby seat.<br><br>Andrew must have seen how Margaret's questions had affected her, for he left her to her thoughts. He and Margaret exchanged addresses and phone numbers; then, with a promise to share whatever they discovered, Andrew showed her to the door. A few moments later, Sylvia heard him start the engine. Only then did she rouse herself and move to the front passenger seat beside him.<br><br>They drove in silence for nearly an hour before Sylvia spoke. "Do you suppose Margaret and I could have an ancestor in common?"<br><br>"It's possible." He kept his eyes on the road. "What do you think?"<br><br>"I think I was much more content before I learned I might have slave owners in the family."<br><br>"All families have members they're not so proud of."<br><br>"Yes, but slave owners?"<br><br>"Don't be too hard on them. They were people of their times."<br><br>"Plenty of other people of their times didn't own slaves. Hans and Anneke, for example. Elm Creek Manor was a station on the Underground Railroad, did you know that?"<br><br>He gave her a sidelong glance. "You might have mentioned it once or twice."<br><br>"If I've bragged, it's because I'm proud of them. I should be proud. That was brave and dangerous work. And now I'm supposed to accept that some of my relatives -- well, I don't accept it." She folded her arms and glared out the windshield at the lights of other cars speeding down the freeway. Night had fallen, but the sky was overcast. She wondered where the North Star was. It ought to be directly overhead, or nearly so. So long ago, it had shown the way to freedom, and her family had offered sanctuary to many of those who had braved the hazards of the path it illuminated.<br><br>But Elm Creek Manor was so secluded, the North Star alone would not have been enough to guide a stranger to its door.<br>rd<br><br>"Andrew," said Sylvia, "I don't believe the quilt preserved memories of Elm Creek Manor. I think it was meant to show the way."<br><br>She had heard of such things before, quilts with coded messages or even maps revealing safe pathways along the Underground Railroad. The very name of Margaret's quilt suggested it might be one of those legendary artifacts. But in all of Sylvia's decades as a quilter and lecturer, she had never seen one of these quilts, only heard lore of them around the quilt frame. Her friend Grace Daniels, a master quilter and museum curator, had once told her that not only had no one ever documented a map quilt from the era, no slave narrative or Abolitionist testimonial she had read mentioned one.<br><br>Sylvia respected Grace's expertise, and yet, in the stillness of her own heart, she yearned for the folklore to be true. Within her own family, a tale had been handed down through the generations about a quilt used to signal to fugitive slaves. Folklore carried a stronger ring of truth when one loved and trusted the person who spoke it.<br><br>But now, torn between her memories and the questions Margaret Alden's quilt raised, Sylvia would need more than folklore and family histories to discern the truth. She needed evidence only Elm Creek Manor could provide.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Andrew and Sylvia preferred to drive at a leisurely pace, so it wasn't until several days after the encounter with Margaret Alden that they pulled off the freeway and headed down the two-lane road past picturesque farms and rolling, forested hills toward home. Sylvia sighed with happiness when they turned onto a gravel road that wound its way through a familiar leafy wood. Before long, Elm Creek came into view, marking the southern border of the estate.<br><br>When the road forked, Andrew stayed to the left, following the road that led to the parking lot at the rear entrance of the manor. The right fork would have taken them over a narrow bridge and across a vast lawn up to the front entrance -- a more grand...</p><h2>Sewing Victorian Doll Clothes: Authentic Costumes from Museum Collections</h2><p>Enjoy fabulous full-color photographs of Victorian dolls dressed in authentic period splendor.

As profound and powerful as this classic text has been for generations of seekers, integrating its lessons into the ordinary patterns of our lives can ultimately seem beyond our reach. Now, in a fascinating series of reflections, anecdotes, stories, and exercises, Ram Dass gives us a unique and accessible road map for experiencing divinity in everyday life. In the engaging, conversational style that has made his teachings so popular for decades, Ram Dass traces our journey of consciousness as it is reflected in one of Hinduism&#x2019;s most sacred texts. The Gita teaches a system of yogas, or &#x201c;paths for coming to union with God.&#x201d; <br><br>In <i>Paths to God</i>, Ram Dass brings the heart of that system to light for a Western audience and translates the Gita&#x2019;s principles into the manual for living the yoga of contemporary life. <br><br>While being a guide to the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita, <i>Paths to God</i> is also a template for expanding our definition of ourselves and allowing us to appreciate a new level of meaning in our lives.</p><p>RAM DASS has served on the faculty at Stanford and Harvard Universities. In the 1960s, Ram Dass traveled to India, where he met his guru. Since then, he has pursued a variety of spiritual practices, including guru kripa, devotional yoga, karma yoga, many forms of meditation, and Sufi and Jewish studies. Many of his books, including <b>Be Here Now</b>, are international bestsellers and classics of their kind.Chapter 1<br><br>Context and Conflict<br><br>Before we approach the Bhagavad Gita, we need to have a contextual framework for the way it fits into the Mahabharata, of which it's a part. The Mahabharata is one of the two great Indian epics (the Ramayana being the other). The Mahabharata is a huge book-a typical edition runs to nearly six thousand pages. It is said to be the longest literary work in the world; it is seven times the length of The Iliad and The Odyssey combined, and the only unabridged English edition runs to twelve volumes. It's thought to have been written somewhere between 500 and 200 b.c., and it covers a distant period of Indian history: tradition places the battle of Kurukshetra in 3102 b.c., although historians say it was probably more like 1400 b.c. when the events that inspired the Mahabharata took place.<br><br>At one level, the Mahabharata is an historical study of a kingdom; but at another level, it is an extraordinary symbological study of all human interactions, of all human emotions and motivations. It's like an incredible psychology book cast in the form of a drama, and it's written from a very conscious point of view, which means that although it can be read just for its romantic, melodramatic story line, it can also be read to uncover its deeper symbolism. And right in the middle of the Mahabharata, on the eve of the climactic battle between the kingdom's two warring families, comes the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna that's called the Bhagavad Gita, or "the Song of God."<br><br>The story of the Mahabharata concerns the kingdom of Bharat, in northern India. The king of Bharat had two sons, Dhritarashtra and Pandu. Dhritarashtra was the elder brother, and ordinarily would have been next in line to inherit the throne after their father died; but he had been born blind, and the traditions of the time didn't allow for a blind king, so Pandu became the king instead, and ruled the kingdom.<br><br>Now, what it is that Dhritarashtra's blindness represents in the story is something that has been expounded upon with great relish by countless Hindu pundits over the centuries. Some say his blindness represents his attachment to his son, Duryodhana, which makes him blind to the dharma, blind to truth or to higher wisdom. Some say the blindness represents the nature of the human condition, which is blind because it lacks the higher intellect. The symbolism is very rich.<br><br>Pandu, the younger brother, the king, had two wives-Kunti and Madri-and he had five children by them. Of these five children (and these turn out to be the good guys, by the way-the Pandavas), Yuddhisthira was the eldest. Yuddhisthira was virtually the embodiment of dharma, although he did have one minor failing, which was that he gambled-he liked to play dice-and that, we will see, is what ultimately leads us to the predicament we find ourselves in at Kurukshetra. Bhima, Pandu's second son, was very strong and rather reckless. Arjuna, the third, was pure, noble, chivalrous, and heroic; he turns out to be our hero in the Gita. And there were two younger sons, twins by Madri.<br><br>Dhritarashtra-the elder, blind brother-had a hundred children, all by one wife. (I know a hundred children-but we're just going to have to allow for these strange things in the Mahabharata. We make room for them in the Old Testament, with 120-year-old men having scores of children. So let's just assume that things are different in different times.) Dhritarashtra's wife, Gandhari, was incredibly devoted to him. She was so devoted that since he couldn't see, she kept her own eyes bandaged throughout her entire married life, because she said that it would be unseemly for her to see when her husband was blind. That's devoted!<br><br>Well, a few years into his reign, Pandu accidentally killed a Brahmin. Killing a Brahmin, even by accident, is a very bad thing to do, so to atone for it, Pandu retired to the forest to do tapasya (penances), leaving the kingdom in the care of Dhritarashtra. After some years, while he was still away in the forest, Pandu died as the result of a curse, and Dhritarashtra just went on ruling Bharat.<br><br>As the children grew up, Duryodhana, Dhritarashtra's eldest son, grew more and more jealous of Yuddhisthira, the eldest son of Pandu. You can see that the laws of succession would be a little hazy in this situation, but it looked as though Yuddhisthira, as the eldest Pandu son, was going to be the one to inherit the kingdom whenever Dhritarashtra died-and Duryodhana wanted it for himself. He pulled every dirty trick in the books to try to get it; the Mahabharata devotes hundreds of pages to descriptions of all the ways Duryodhana went about scheming to get rid of the Pandavas, so he could take over the kingdom. Finally, Duryodhana held a huge celebration, and invited all the Pandavas to attend. He had a magnificent palace built to house them, but he had it made of some very flammable material, and during the night, when he expected all the Pandavas to be asleep inside, he set the building afire. Luckily, the Pandavas had been forewarned by a loyal servant, and so they-the five boys and their mother-had escaped through an underground passage and gone off into the jungle, into hiding.<br><br>Now, just to give you a little more of the flavor of this story: While they were in hiding, living in a cave in the jungle, the Pandava boys heard that there was to be a swayamvara, a husband-selecting ceremony, for Draupadi, the beautiful daughter of a very high king, to find a suitable mate for her. All the princes would be there, of course, because they all wanted to marry this rich, beautiful lady.<br><br>At the gathering, a number of tasks were set for the would-be suitors: stringing a magical bow, shooting a target by looking at its reflection in a pool of water, feats like that. All the princes tried, and all the princes failed. Then this poor young Brahmin priest came along, and he easily accomplished all the tasks, one after the other. That was Arjuna in drag, of course. So Arjuna won Draupadi's hand, and he and his brothers took her and headed back to their cave in the jungle.<br><br>As they approached the cave where they were living, the boys yelled out to Kunti, their mother, Come out, Ma! See what we have brought today!<br><br>Kunti was in the cave and couldn't see her sons, but she called out, Whatever it be, share it equally among all of you. That's a good thing for a mother to say to her five children-usually! But this time it meant that all five brothers ended up being the husbands of Draupadi-she had five husbands by the mother's "boon."<br><br>Well, after some years in hiding, the Pandavas made their way back to the kingdom of Bharat, and Dhritarashtra (who wasn't a bad guy, really-it was his son who was out of control) insisted that Duryodhana give them a piece of land to rule. Duryodhana, as you'd expect, picked out the worst piece of land in the kingdom to give to the Pandavas; it had nothing going for it. But in spite of that, Yuddhisthira and his brothers made a go of it, and created a very good kingdom, prosperous and well ruled. That just made Duryodhana more jealous than ever, of course; he grew insanely jealous, and all he could think about was plotting against the Pandavas.<br><br>Duryodhana remembered that Yuddhishthira, the oldest Pandava brother, really liked playing dice, so he challenged Yuddhisthira to a dice game, and got a crooked dice player to play opposite him. The two of them played out their dice game, and in the course of it Yuddhishthira lost everything: He lost his kingdom, he forfeited his brothers into servitude, he sold Draupadi down the river-everything he had, went.<br><br>Duryodhana was ecstatic! He was so haughty about what he'd done that he had Draupadi brought in, planning to strip her naked in front of the court, to shame her. But when he went to pull off her sari, he found that no matter how many saris he pulled away, there was always one more underneath. He had piles of saris everywhere, but Draupadi was still clothed, because she was protected by the purity of the dharma. (And, of course, Krishna, whom the Pandavas had met while they were off in hiding, was helping secretly, on the side.)<br><br>When Dhritarashtra heard about the episode with Draupadi, he was so embarrassed by his son's behavior that he offered Draupadi three boons. She said, Well, for the first one, let my husbands go free, and for the second, give them back their weapons. And that's enough-I won't even need the third boon. They'll be able to take care of things from there."<br><br>Well, Dhritarashtra kept his promise and freed the Pandavas; but as soon as the brothers were free, Duryodhana sucked Yuddhisthira into another dice game. (Yuddhisthira just never seems to learn, does he?) In this dice game, the losers (who, of course, turned out to be Yuddhisthira and his four brothers) had to go off and live in the jungle for twelve years. And then, in the thirteenth year, it got even worse: They had to hide out for that whole year, because if they were found by Duryodhana during the thirteenth year, they'd have to do still another twelve years in the jungle. But if they made it through all that, Duryodhana promised that at the end of their exile they'd get their kingdom back.<br><br>So back they went to the jungle. They did their twelve years, and in the thirteenth year, in order to hide out, they became servants to a king in a neighboring kingdom. Duryodhana tried everything to find them, but he couldn't. At the end of the thirteenth year, they came back to Bharat and presented themselves before Duryodhana and said, "OK, we did it. Now we want our kingdom."<br><br>Duryodhana said, Tough. I'm keeping it. He said, I wouldn't even give you enough land to carry on the tip of a needle.<br><br>Now that is the background to the situation in which we find ourselves at the time when the events in the Bhagavad Gita are about to take place. That is, Duryodhana has finally pushed the Pandavas too far, and they have no choice now but to fight. Injustice has taken over their kingdom. Arjuna and his brothers have been cheated and lied to; truth has been trampled on. The dharma has to reassert itself-the good guys have to make a statement. War is their only recourse.<br><br>At this point in the story, an interesting event takes place: Arjuna and Duryodhana both go to Krishna, who happens to be God in an avataric form, and they both ask him for his help. In a kind of Solomon-like decision, Krishna says to them, "OK, here are your options: One of you can have all of my weapons and all of my armies...and the other one can have me, but without any armies or weapons." Arjuna immediately says, "Well, I want you-forget about the armies." His mind was turned toward God, and so he said, "All I want is God on my side."<br><br>Well, Duryodhana was very pleased with that! He, being the worldly, adharmic fellow, said, "That's perfect! I'm very happy. I get all the arms and all the might." So now the bad guys have this huge army, while the good guys have a much smaller force. And Krishna, although he's God, is only the charioteer for Arjuna-he's not even carrying a bow.<br><br>At this point, let me introduce you to a little more of Krishna's story, so we can see how he came to this moment on the battlefield. Krishna was the child of Vasudev and Devaki, and Devaki had a very mean brother named Kamsa. Kamsa was so mean that he put his own father in jail, just in order to take over the kingdom.<br><br>But mean though he was, Kamsa had a soft spot in his heart for his sister Devaki. So when she married Vasudev, Kamsa threw a big celebration for her, with a great feast, and afterward announced that he would drive the chariot himself to take the couple to their new home. While they were on their way there, however, a great voice suddenly spoke from the sky and said to Kamsa, "Beware! The eighth child of this couple will kill you."<br><br>Well, that, of course, freaked the brother completely! He was about to kill Devaki and Vasudev right on the spot, but they begged for their lives, and he finally relented. He said, OK, I won't kill you. But you'll have to agree to live in jail for the rest of your lives, and to give me all your children as soon as they're born.<br><br>What could they do? They agreed.<br><br>So Devaki and Vasudev were imprisoned, and their first seven children were taken away the minute they were born. The first six were killed by Kamsa; the seventh has a complicated story of his own, which we won't go into here.<br><br>When the time came for the eighth birth, Kamsa was especially wary. He put extra guards on duty at the prison, and he locked Vasudev and Devaki in chains. But as the time of the birth approached, the guards began to feel very sleepy, and they all dozed off. And then the baby was born. As he came out of the womb, the baby (who, of course, was Krishna) said, "Take me to Gokul, to Nanda's house, and there you will find a girl-child. Substitute me for that baby girl."<br><br>Vasudev said, "How can I take you to Gokul? The doors are locked, and I'm in chains." At that point, Vasudev's chains dropped away and the prison door flew open. Well, Vasudev felt that was a pretty clear message, so he took baby Krishna to Gokul and brought the baby girl back in his place. The guards woke up and saw the baby, and went to tell Kamsa. The wicked brother came to the cell, and thinking that the little girl was his sister's child, he grabbed the baby by her feet, planning to throw her to the floor. But as he touched her feet, she flew out of his hands and up into the sky. As she was going, she called back, "I would have killed you, but you touched my feet; and even though you did that intending to kill me, I will treat it as though you were honoring me and let you go this time." Then she disappeared up into heaven.</p><h2>The Passing: Perspectives of Rural America</h2><p>The rural American landscape is fading like old lumber on the side of a barn, victim of urban sprawl and modernization.

Its destiny is a tumultuous voyage across the Indian Ocean; its crew a motley array of sailors, stowaways, and convicts. In a time of colonial upheaval, the ship boasts a diverse cast of Indians, coolies, and Westerners, from a bankrupt raja to a widowed village woman, from a mulatto American to an evangelical opium trader. As their family ties wash away, they come to view themselves as <i>jahaj-bhais</i>, or ship-brothers, and an unlikely dynasty is born. The vast sweep of this historical adventure spans the lush poppy fields of the Ganges, the rolling high seas, and the back streets of China. But it is the panorama of sharply drawn characters that brings <i>Sea of Poppies</i> so breathtakingly alive. The first in a trilogy, this is a masterpiece by a world-class novelist.</p><p>Amitav Ghosh was born in Calcutta and grew up in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India. He studied at the universities of Delhi and Oxford, and published the first of seven novels, The Circle of Reason, in 1986. He currently divides his time between Calcutta, Goa, and Brooklyn. The first novel in the Ibis trilogy, Sea of Poppies, was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.SEA OF POPPIES (Chapter One)One<p></p><p>The vision of a tall-masted ship, at sail on the ocean, came to Deeti on an otherwise ordinary day, but she knew instantly that the apparition was a sign of destiny, for she had never seen such a vessel before, not even in a dream: how could she have, living as she did in northern Bihar, four hundred miles from the coast? Her village was so far inland that the sea seemed as distant as the netherworld: it was the chasm of darkness where the holy Ganga disappeared into the Kala-Pani, 'the Black Water'.</p><p>It happened at the end of winter, in a year when the poppies were strangely slow to shed their petals: for mile after mile, from Benares onwards, the Ganga seemed to be flowing between twin glaciers, both its banks being blanketed by thick drifts of white-petalled flowers. It was as if the snows of the high Himalayas had descended on the plains to await the arrival of Holi and its springtime profusion of colour.</p><p>The village in which Deeti lived was on the outskirts of the town of Ghazipur, some fifty miles east of Benares. Like all her neighbours, Deeti was preoccupied with the lateness of her poppy crop: that day, she rose early and went through the motions of her daily routine, laying out a freshly washed dhoti and kameez for Hukam Singh, her husband, and preparing the rotis and achar he would eat at midday. Once his meal had been wrapped and packed, she broke off to pay a quick visit to her shrine room: later, after she'd bathed and changed, Deeti would do a proper puja, with flowers and offerings; now, being clothed still in her night-time sari, she merely stopped at the door, to join her hands in a brief genuflection.</p><p>Soon a squeaking wheel announced the arrival of the ox-cart that would take Hukam Singh to the factory where he worked, in Ghazipur, three miles away. Although not far, the distance was too great for Hukam Singh to cover on foot, for he had been wounded in the leg while serving as a sepoy in a British regiment. The disability was not so severe as to require crutches, however, and Hukam Singh was able to make his way to the cart without assistance. Deeti followed a step behind, carrying his food and water, handing the cloth-wrapped package to him after he had climbed in.</p><p>Kalua, the driver of the ox-cart, was a giant of a man, but he made no move to help his passenger and was careful to keep his face hidden from him: he was of the leather-workers' caste and Hukam Singh, as a high-caste Rajput, believed that the sight of his face would bode ill for the day ahead. Now, on climbing into the back of the cart, the former sepoy sat facing to the rear, with his bundle balanced on his lap, to prevent its coming into direct contact with any of the driver's belongings. Thus they would sit, driver and passenger, as the cart creaked along the road to Ghazipur - conversing amicably enough, but never exchanging glances.</p><p>Deeti, too, was careful to keep her face covered in the driver's presence: it was only when she went back inside, to wake Kabutri, her six-year-old daughter, that she allowed the ghungta of her sari to slip off her head. Kabutri was lying curled on her mat and Deeti knew, because of her quickly changing pouts and smiles, that she was deep in a dream: she was about to rouse her when she stopped her hand and stepped back. In her daughter's sleeping face, she could see the lineaments of her own likeness - the same full lips, rounded nose and upturned chin - except that in the child the lines were still clean and sharply drawn, whereas in herself they had grown smudged and indistinct. After seven years of marriage, Deeti was not much more than a child herself, but a few tendrils of white had already appeared in her thick black hair. The skin of her face, parched and darkened by the sun, had begun to flake and crack around the corners of her mouth and her eyes. Yet, despite the careworn commonplaceness of her appearance, there was one respect in which she stood out from the ordinary: she had light grey eyes, a feature that was unusual in that part of the country. Such was the colour - or perhaps colourlessness - of her eyes that they made her seem at once blind and all-seeing. This had the effect of unnerving the young, and of reinforcing their prejudices and superstitions to the point where they would sometimes shout taunts at her - <i>chudaliya, dainiya</i> - as if she were a witch: but Deeti had only to turn her eyes on them to make them scatter and run off. Although not above taking a little pleasure in her powers of discomfiture, Deeti was glad, for her daughter's sake, that this was one aspect of her appearance that she had not passed on - she delighted in Kabutri's dark eyes, which were as black as her shiny hair. Now, looking down on her daughter's dreaming face, Deeti smiled and decided that she wouldn't wake her after all: in three or four years the girl would be married and gone; there would be enough time for her to work when she was received into her husband's house; in her few remaining years at home she might as well rest.</p><p>With scarcely a pause for a mouthful of roti, Deeti stepped outside, on to the flat threshold of beaten earth that divided the mud-walled dwelling from the poppy fields beyond. By the light of the newly risen sun, she saw, greatly to her relief, that some of her flowers had at last begun to shed their petals. On the adjacent field, her husband's younger brother, Chandan Singh, was already out with his eight-bladed nukha in hand. He was using the tool's tiny teeth to make notches on some of the bare pods - if the sap flowed freely overnight he would bring his family out tomorrow, to tap the field. The timing had to be exactly right because the priceless sap flowed only for a brief period in the plant's span of life: a day or two this way or that, and the pods were of no more value than the blossoms of a weed.</p><p>Chandan Singh had seen her too and he was not a person who could let anyone pass by in silence. A slack-jawed youth with a brood of five children of his own, he never missed an opportunity to remind Deeti of her paucity of offspring. <i>Ka bha�l?</i> he called out, licking a drop of fresh sap from the tip of his instrument. What's the matter? Working alone again? How long can you carry on like this? You need a son, to give you a helping hand. You're not barren, after all . . .</p><p>Being accustomed to her brother-in-law's ways, Deeti had no difficulty in ignoring his jibes: turning her back on him, she headed into her own field, carrying a wide wicker basket at her waist. Between the rows of flowers, the ground was carpeted in papery petals and she scooped them up in handfuls, dropping them into her basket. A week or two before, she would have taken care to creep sideways, so as not to disturb the flowers, but today she all but flounced as she went and was none too sorry when her swishing sari swept clusters of petals off the ripening pods. When the basket was full, she carried it back and emptied it next to the outdoor chula where she did most of her cooking. This part of the threshold was shaded by two enormous mango trees, which had just begun to sprout the dimples that would grow into the first buds of spring. Relieved to be out of the sun, Deeti squatted beside her oven and thrust an armload of firewood into last night's embers, which could still be seen glowing, deep inside the ashes.</p><p>Kabutri was awake now, and when she showed her face in the doorway, her mother was no longer in a mood to be indulgent. So late? she snapped. Where were you? <i>K�m-o-k�j na hoi?</i> You think there's no work to be done?</p><p>Deeti gave her daughter the job of sweeping the poppy petals into a heap while she busied herself in stoking the fire and heating a heavy iron tawa. Once this griddle was heated through, she sprinkled a handful of petals on it and pressed them down with a bundled-up rag. Darkening as they toasted, the petals began to cling together so that in a minute or two they looked exactly like the round wheat-flour rotis Deeti had packed for her husband's midday meal. And 'roti' was indeed the name by which these poppy-petal wrappers were known although their purpose was entirely different from that of their namesake: they were to be sold to the Sudder Opium Factory, in Ghazipur, where they would be used to line the earthenware containers in which opium was packed.</p><p>Kabutri, in the meanwhile, had kneaded some atta and rolled out a few real rotis. Deeti cooked them quickly, before poking out the fire: the rotis were put aside, to be eaten later with yesterday's leftovers - a dish of stale alu-posth, potatoes cooked in poppy-seed paste. Now, her mind turned to her shrine room again: with the hour of the noontime puja drawing close, it was time to go down to the river for a bath. After massaging poppy-seed oil into Kabutri's hair and her own, Deeti draped her spare sari over her shoulder and led her daughter towards the water, across the field.</p><p>The poppies ended at a sandbank that sloped gently down to the Ganga; warmed by the sun, the sand was hot enough to sting the soles of their bare feet. The burden of motherly decorum slipped suddenly off Deeti's bowed shoulders and she began to run after her daughter, who had skipped on ahead. A pace or two from the water's edge, they shouted an invocation to the river - <i>Jai Ganga Mayya ki</i> . . . - and gulped down a draught of air, before throwing themselves in.</p><p>They were both laughing when they came up again: it was the time of year when, after the initial shock of contact, the water soon reveals itself to be refreshingly cool. Although the full heat of summer was still several weeks away, the flow of the Ganga had already begun to dwindle. Turning in the direction of Benares, in the west, Deeti hoisted her daughter aloft, to pour out a handful of water as a tribute to the holy city. Along with the offering, a leaf flowed out of the child's cupped palms. They turned to watch as the river carried it downstream towards the ghats of Ghazipur.</p><p>The walls of Ghazipur's opium factory were partially obscured by mango and jackfruit trees but the British flag that flew on top of it was just visible above the foliage, as was the steeple of the church in which the factory's overseers prayed. At the factory's ghat on the Ganga, a one-masted pateli barge could be seen, flying the pennant of the English East India Company. It had brought in a shipment of <i>chal�n</i> opium, from one of the Company's outlying sub-agencies, and was being unloaded by a long line of coolies.</p><p>Ma, said Kabutri, looking up at her mother, where is that boat going?</p><p>It was Kabutri's question that triggered Deeti's vision: her eyes suddenly conjured up a picture of an immense ship with two tall masts. Suspended from the masts were great sails of a dazzling shade of white. The prow of the ship tapered into a figurehead with a long bill, like a stork or a heron. There was a man in the background, standing near the bow, and although she could not see him clearly, she had a sense of a distinctive and unfamiliar presence.</p><p>Deeti knew that the vision was not materially present in front of her - as, for example, was the barge moored near the factory. She had never seen the sea, never left the district, never spoken any language but her native Bhojpuri, yet not for a moment did she doubt that the ship existed somewhere and was heading in her direction. The knowledge of this terrified her, for she had never set eyes on anything that remotely resembled this apparition, and had no idea what it might portend.</p><p>Kabutri knew that something unusual had happened, for she waited a minute or two before asking: Ma? What are you looking at? What have you seen?</p><p>Deeti's face was a mask of fear and foreboding as she said, in a shaky voice: Beti - I saw a jahaj - a ship.</p><p>Do you mean that boat over there?</p><p>No, beti: it was a ship like I've never seen before. It was like a great bird, with sails like wings and a long beak.</p><p>Casting a glance downriver, Kabutri said: Can you draw for me what you saw?</p><p>Deeti answered with a nod and they waded ashore. They changed quickly and filled a pitcher with water from the Ganga, for the puja room. When they were back at home, Deeti lit a lamp before leading Kabutri into the shrine. The room was dark, with soot-blackened walls, and it smelled strongly of oil and incense. There was a small altar inside, with statues of Shivji and Bhagwan Ganesh, and framed prints of Ma Durga and Shri Krishna. But the room was a shrine not just to the gods but also to Deeti's personal pantheon, and it contained many tokens of her family and forebears - among them such relics as her dead father's wooden clogs, a necklace of rudraksha beads left to her by her mother, and faded imprints of her grandparents' feet, taken on their funeral pyres. The walls around the altar were devoted to pictures that Deeti had drawn herself, in outline, on papery poppy-petal discs: such were the charcoal portraits of two brothers and a sister, all of whom had died as children. A few living relatives were represented too, but only by diagrammatic images drawn on mango leaves - Deeti believed it to be bad luck to attempt overly realistic portraits of those who had yet to leave this earth. Thus her beloved older brother, Kesri Singh, was depicted by a few strokes that stood for his sepoy's rifle and his upturned moustache.</p><p>Now, on entering her puja room, Deeti picked up a green mango leaf, dipped a fingertip in a container of bright red sindoor and drew, with a few strokes, two wing-like triangles hanging suspended above a long curved shape that ended in a hooked bill. It could have been a bird in flight but Kabutri recognized it at once for what it was - an image of a two-masted vessel with unfurled sails. She was amazed that her mother had drawn the image as though she were representing a living being.</p><p>Are you going to put it in the puja room? she asked.</p><p>Yes, said Deeti.</p><p>The child could not understand why a ship should find a place in the family pantheon. But why? she said.</p><p>I don't know, said Deeti, for she too was puzzled by the sureness of her intuition: I just know that it must be there; and not just the ship, but also many of those who are in it; they too must be on the walls of our puja room.</p><p>But who are they? said the puzzled child.</p><p>I don't know yet, Deeti told her. But I will when I see them.</p><p></p><p>The carved head of a bird that held up the bowsprit of the <i>Ibis</i> was unusual enough to serve as proof, to those who needed it, that this was indeed the ship that Deeti saw while standing half-immersed in the waters of the Ganga. Later, even seasoned sailors would admit that her drawing was an uncannily evocative rendition of its subject, especially considering that it was made by someone who had never set eyes on a two-masted schooner - or, for that matter, any other deep-water vessel.</p><p>In time, among the legions who came to regard the <i>Ibis</i> as their ancestor, it was accepted that it was the river itself that had granted Deeti the vision: that the image of the <i>Ibis</i> had been transported upstream, like an electric current, the moment the vessel made contact with the sacred waters. This would mean that it happened in the second week of March 1838, for that was when the <i>Ibis</i> dropped anchor off Ganga-Sagar Island, where the holy river debouches into the Bay of Bengal. It was here, while the <i>Ibis</i> waited to take on a pilot to guide her to Calcutta, that Zachary Reid had his first look at India: what he saw was a dense thicket of mangroves, and a mudbank that appeared to be uninhabited until it disgorged its bumboats - a small flotilla of dinghies and canoes, all intent on peddling fruit, fish and vegetables to the newly arrived ...</p></p><h2>My Friends the Frogs (Heath Reading)</h2><p>A collection of simple stories, a poem, a fairy tale, and easy-to-follow instructions for making a hat.</p><p></p><h2>Keeping Good Company: A Season-by-Season Collection of Recipes, with Entertaining and Homemaking Ideas</h2><p>It is the good company of friends and family, as well as the favorite foods we share, that feeds and sustains us." --Roxie Kelley and Shelly Reeves Smith<br><br>* This illustrated cookbook series is available for the first time in paperback.<br><br>Roxie Kelley and Shelly Reeves Smith nourish the body and soul by combining simple yet satisfying recipes with tips on gracious living and friendly entertaining, all presented alongside warm and inviting hand-drawn illustrations.

But music has an even more astonishing power, one you may have suspected from your own experience, but which you will now learn well documented. Quite simply, music is good for you-physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Particular sounds, tones and rhythms, especially the music of Mozart, Gregorian chant, and some jazz, New Age, Latin, pop, and even rock music, can strengthen the mind, unlock the creative spirit, and, miraculously, even heal the body. This remarkable phenomenon is called The Mozart Effect.Stimulating, authoritative, and often lyrical, THE MOZART EFFECT offers dramatic accounts of how doctors, shamans, musicians, and health care professionals use music to deal with everything from anxiety to cancer, high blood pressure, chronic pain, dyslexia, even mental illness. Students who sing or play an instrument score up to 51 points higher on SAT than the national average. During strenuous exercise, the upbeat music of Diana Ross can lessen fatigue and release endorphins, the body&#39;s natural painkillers. The director of a Baltimore hospital&#39;s coronary care unit says that half an hour of classical music produces the same effect as ten milligrams of Valium. And now, whatever your listening taste, Don Campbell explains how to make the Mozart Effect work for you.</p><p>With a subtitle of <i>Tapping the Power of Music to Heal the Body, Strengthen the Mind, and Unlock the Creative Spirit</i>, the casual reader might jokingly ask if the book could also improve chances for world peace, bring free and open elections to third world countries, and give your wash whiter whites and brighter brights. Don Campbell's premise is, however, reasonably straightforward: he asserts that the kind of noise to which one is exposed can have important effects on mental and bodily health. As a trial, try protecting your hearing for a few days from the continuous barrage of noise in a typical urban environment; it really does seem to improve one's attitude and fatigue levels. <p> Where Campbell's ideas become more provocative is in the realm of music. Supported by much anecdotal evidence, he proposes that Classical music with a big "C" (the music of Mozart's period) can reach out to those who are mentally isolated from their fellows, like the autistic, and can help infants react and think better. (Will prenatal music classes be the next big trend for yuppie babies?) In addition, the music of Mozart contributes to the improved functioning of the higher cerebellar functions, including the ability to deal with logical and mathematical concepts, while contemporary rock actually decreases mental acuity.</p>Listen to Don Campbell's credentials.<p>A Texas native, Don Campbell studied with Nadia Boulanger at the Fontainebleau Conservatory of Music in France and has worked with Jean Houston, Leonard Bernstein and other musicians, healers and mind/body researchers.</p><p>Over the years, his quest to harness the healing and creative powers of sound and music has taken him to 40 countries, including Haiti, Russia, Israel, Greece, Tibet, Indonesia and Thailand, where he has studied indigenous culture, taught and worked with children and young adults, and given his own performances. He has taught and performed in most of the capitals of Europe and lived in Japan for several years, serving as music critic for a Tokyo newspaper.</p><p>He founded the Institute of Music, Health and Education in 1988, and is known to the public through frequent television and radio appearances and international lecture tours.

This book explores how Mussar principles are relevant to contemporary life, discusses the challenges of making moral choices, and explains how to use Mussar principles to develop a meaningful spiritual practice that is based on the needs of others, rather than the self.</p><p>"Love your neighbor" is the central obligation of Jewish life. Mussar, a late 19th century Jewish renewal movement, focused on this precept as a means of self-improvement and spiritual growth. Through the practical applications of Mussar, one can learn how to awaken to a spirituality that is compassionate, moral, and generous. In this book, Rabbi Ira Stone provides a contemporary theological framework for understanding Mussar and describes how participation in a Mussar group can offer support and guidance for this powerful spiritual practice. <p>"This book is a marvelous gift to a generation seeking new spiritual paths in order to live a richly Jewish and deeply human life. Ira Stone uncovers a neglected treasure in modern Judaism, the 19th century Mussar movement which sought to develop the human being into a mensch by reuniting mitzvot and morality. Stone gives us his post-modern theology of Mussar, guides us through its theory of the process of self-development using its methods of self-improvement. In a final s, Stone shows how, in the mode of Mussar, prayer and halakhah awaken our spirit and teach us to concretize God's love and our love for fellow human beings. The appendix introduces us to one of the great teachers of the Mussar movement, Rabbi Simcha Zissel Broyde of Kelm and translates and annotates excerpts from his writing. This book is a treasure to be read and reread." </p><p>Rabbi Irving Greenberg President, Jewish Life Network/Steinhardt Foundation </p><p>"Sometimes we do not know what we should do morally, but sometimes we know full well what we should do but lack the strength of character or motivation to do it. The Mussar movement developed in Judaism to help us do what we know is right. This book is a wonderfully clear and helpful exposition of one form of Mussar. As such, it has the power to do nothing less than improve our moral character and change our lives for the better." </p><p>Rabbi Elliot Dorff Author of To Do the Right and the Good: A Jewish Approach to Modern Social Ethics </p><p>"Here you will find hidden gems of the authentic, time-tested Jewish spiritual tradition of Mussar -- and be shown steps you can take to open your own heart. Rabbi Stone passionately reminds us that when we extend our hand to help another bear their burden, the pathway to the Beloved we seek opens before us." </p><p>Alan Morinis Author of Climbing Jacob's Ladder: One Man's Rediscovery of a Jewish Spiritual Tradition </p><p>"For over a decade, Rabbi Stone taught courses on Emmanuel Levinas and Mussar in the Jewish Theological Seminary's Department of Jewish Philosophy. This impressive study brings together his two scholarly passions and demonstrates their intrinsic congruence. In the hands of this gifted and experienced teacher, this material becomes not only accessible but even positively engaging. Every serious student of Jewish thought is in debt to Rabbi Stone and to the Aviv Press for this gift." </p><p>Rabbi Neil Gillman Professor of Jewish Philosophy, Jewish Theological Seminary </p><p>"Ira Stone has written a learned and profound introduction to the theory and practice of Mussar, a great contribution to the recent revival of Mussar in the Jewish community. In a way that is both challenging and accessible, Ira Stone offers a compelling theology for the contemporary Jew. This book will be of great value for both students of the sacred psychology of Mussar and for all Jewish seekers and students of Jewish theology." </p><p>Rabbi Amy Eilberg Codirector of the Morei Derekh training program of the Yedidya Center for Jewish Spiritual Direction </p><p>Ira F.

Each subsequent collection&#x2014;<i>Through the Safety Net, A Relative Stranger, </i>and<i> Believers</i>&#x2014;was further confirmation of his mastery: his gift for capturing the immediate moment, for revealing the unexpected in the ordinary, for showing how the smallest shock can pierce the heart of an intimacy. <i>Gryphon</i> brings together the best of Baxter&#x2019;s previous collections with seven new stories, giving us the most complete portrait of his achievement. <br>&nbsp;<br>Baxter once described himself as &#x201c;a Midwestern writer in a postmodern age&#x201d;: at home in a terrain best known for its blandness, one that does not give up its secrets easily, whose residents don&#x2019;t always talk about what&#x2019;s on their mind, and where something out of the quotidian&#x2014;some stress, the appearance of a stranger, or a knock on the window&#x2014;may be all that&#x2019;s needed to force what lies underneath to the surface and to disclose a surprising impulse, frustration, or desire. Whether friends or strangers, the characters in Baxter&#x2019;s stories share a desire&#x2014;sometimes muted and sometimes fierce&#x2014;to break through the fragile glass of convention. In the title story, a substitute teacher walks into a new classroom, draws an outsized tree on the blackboard on a whim, and rewards her students by reading their fortunes using a Tarot deck. In each of the stories we see the delicate tension between what we want to believe and what we need to believe. <br>&nbsp;<br>By turns compassionate, gently humorous, and haunting, <i>Gryphon</i> proves William Maxwell&#x2019;s assertion that &#x201c;nobody can touch Charles Baxter in the field that he has carved out for himself.&#x201d;</p></p><p><b>Charles Baxter</b> is the author of the novels <i>The Feast of Love</i> (nominated for the National Book Award), <i>The Soul Thief, Saul and Patsy, Shadow Play</i>, and <i>First Light</i>, and the story collections <i>Believers, A Relative Stranger, Through the Safety Net</i>, and <i>Harmony of the World</i>.

Program for Writers at Warren Wilson College.<p><b><i>The Next Building I Plan to Bomb </i></b><br><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>In the parking lot next to the bank, Harry Edmonds saw a piece of gray scrap paper the size of a greeting card. It had blown up next to his leg and attached itself to him there. Across the top margin was some scrabby writing in purple ink. He picked it up and examined it. On the upper left-hand corner someone had scrawled the phrase THE NEXT BUILDING I PLAN TO BOMB. Harry unfolded the paper and saw an inked drawing of what appeared to be a sizable train station or some other public structure, perhaps an airport terminal. In the drawing were arched windows and front pillars but very little other supporting detail. The building looked solid, monumental, and difficult to destroy. <br>&nbsp;<br>He glanced around the parking lot. There he was in Five Oaks, Michi�gan, where there were no such buildings. In the light wind other pieces of paper floated by in an agitated manner. One yellow flyer was stuck to a fire hydrant. On the street was the daily crowd of bankers, lawyers, shoppers, and students. As usual, no one was watching him or paying much attention to him. He put the piece of paper into his coat pocket. <br>&nbsp;<br>All afternoon, while he sat at his desk, his hand traveled down to his pocket to touch the drawing. Late in the day, half as a joke, he showed the paper to the office receptionist. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to take it to the police,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;This is dangerous. This is the work of a maniac. That&#x2019;s LaGuardia there, the airport? In the picture? I was there last month. I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s LaGuardia, Mr. Edmonds. No kidding. Definitely LaGuardia.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>So at the end of the day, before going home, he drove to the main police station on the first floor of City Hall. Driving into the sun, he felt his eyes squinting against the burrowing glare. He had stepped inside the front door when the waxy bureaucratic smell of the building hit him and gave him an immediate headache. A cop in uniform, wearing an impa�tient expression, sat behind a desk, shuffling through some papers, and at that moment it occurred to Harry Edmonds that if he showed what was in his pocket to the police he himself would become a prime suspect and an object of intense scrutiny, all privacy gone. He turned on his heel and went home. <br>&nbsp;<br>***<br>At dinner, he said to his girlfriend, &#x201c;Look what I found in a parking lot today.&#x201d; He handed her the drawing. <br>&nbsp;<br>Lucia examined the soiled paper, her thumb and finger at its corner, and said, &#x201c; &#x2018;The next building I plan to bomb.&#x2019; &#x201d; Her tone was light and urbane. She sold computer software and was sensitive to gestures. Then she said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Union Station, in Chicago.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;Well, Harry, what are you going to do with this? Some nutcase did this, right?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Actually, I got as far as the foyer in the police station this afternoon,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Then I turned around. I couldn&#x2019;t show it to them. I thought they&#x2019;d suspect me or something.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s so melodramatic,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve never committed a crime in your life. You&#x2019;re a banker, for Chrissake. You&#x2019;re in the trust department. You&#x2019;re harmless.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Harry sat back in his chair and looked at her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not that harmless.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, you are.&#x201d; She laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re quite harmless.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Lucia,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I wish you wouldn&#x2019;t use that word.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Harmless&#x2019;? It&#x2019;s a compliment.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Not in this country, it isn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said. <br>&nbsp;<br>On the table were the blue plates and matching napkins and the yel�low candles that Lucia brought out whenever she was proud of what she or Harry had cooked. Today it was Burmese chicken curry. &#x201c;Well, if you&#x2019;re worried, take it to the cops,&#x201d; Lucia told him. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what the cops are there for. Honey,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;no one will suspect you of any�thing. You&#x2019;re handsome and stable and you&#x2019;re my sweetie, and I love you, and what else happened today? Put that awful creepy paper back into your pocket. How do you like the curry?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s delicious,&#x201d; he said. <br>&nbsp;<br>***<br>After Harry had gotten up his nerve sufficiently to enter the police sta�tion again, he walked in a determined manner toward the front desk. After looking carefully at the drawing and the inked phrase, and writing down Harry Edmonds&#x2019;s name and address, the officer, whose badge identified him as Sergeant Bursk, asked, &#x201c;Mr. Edmonds, you got any kids?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Kids? No, I don&#x2019;t have kids. Why?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Kids did this,&#x201d; Sergeant Bursk told him, waving the paper in front of him as if he were drying it off. &#x201c;My kids could&#x2019;ve done this. Kids do this. Boys do this. They draw torture chambers and they make threats and what-have-you. That&#x2019;s what they do. It&#x2019;s the youth. But they&#x2019;re kids. They don&#x2019;t mean it.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Because I have three of them,&#x201d; Sergeant Bursk said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not saying that you should have kids, I&#x2019;m just saying that I have them. I&#x2019;ll keep this drawing, though, if you don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; Harry said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like it back.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Sergeant Bursk said, handing it to him, &#x201c;but if we hear of any major bombings, and, you know, large-scale serious death, maybe we&#x2019;ll give you a call.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Harry said. He had been expecting this. &#x201c;By the way,&#x201d; he asked, &#x201c;does this look like any place in particular to you?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>The cop examined the picture. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Grand Cen�tral. In New York, on Forty-second Street, I think. I was there once. You can tell by the clock. See this clock here?&#x201d; He pointed at a vague circle. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Grand Central, and this is the big clock that they&#x2019;ve got there on the front.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>***<br>&#x201c;The f**k it is,&#x201d; the kid said. The kid was in bed with Harry Edmonds in the Motel 6. They had found each other in a bar downtown and then gone to this motel, and after they were finished, Harry drew the drawing out of his pants pocket on the floor and showed it to him. The kid&#x2019;s long brown hair fell over his eyes and, loosened from its ponytail, spread out on the pillow. &#x201c;I know this f**king place,&#x201d; the kid said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve, like, trav�eled, you know, all over Europe. This is in Europe, this place, this is f**king Deutschland we&#x2019;re talking about here.&#x201d; The kid got up on his elbows to see better. &#x201c;Oh, yeah, I remember this place. I was there, two summers ago? Hamburg? This is the Dammtor Bahnhof.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Never heard of it,&#x201d; Harry Edmonds said. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You never heard of it &#x2019;cause you&#x2019;ve never been there, man. You have to f**king be there to know about it.&#x201d; The kid squinched his eyebrows together like a professor making a difficult point. &#x201c;A <i>bahnhof, </i>see, is a train station, and the Dammtor Bahnhof is, like, one of the stations there, and this is the one that the Nazis rounded up the Jews to. And, like, sent them off from. This place, man. Absolutely. It&#x2019;s still standing. This one, it f**king deserves to be bombed. Just blow it totally the f**k away, off the face of the earth. That&#x2019;s just my opinion. It&#x2019;s evil, man.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>The kid moved his body around in bed, getting himself comfortable again after stating his opinions. He was slinky and warm, like a cat. The kid even made back-of-the-throat noises, a sort of satisfied purr. <br>&nbsp;<br>***<br>&#x201c;I thought we were finished with that,&#x201d; Harry&#x2019;s therapist said. &#x201c;I thought we were finished with the casual sex. I thought, Harry, that we had worked through those fugitive impulses. I must tell you that it troubles me that we haven&#x2019;t. I won&#x2019;t say that we&#x2019;re back to square one, but it is a backward step. And what I&#x2019;m wondering now is, why did it happen?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Lucia said I was harmless, that&#x2019;s why.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And did that anger you?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You bet it angered me.&#x201d; Harry sat back in his chair and looked directly at his therapist. He wished she would get a new pair of eye�glasses. These eyeglasses made her look like one of those movie victims killed within the first ten minutes, right after the opening credits. One of those innocent bystanders. &#x201c;Bankers are not harmless, I can assure you.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Then why did you pick up that boy?&#x201d; She waited. When he didn&#x2019;t say anything, she said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t think of anything more dangerous to do.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It was the building,&#x201d; Harry said. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What building?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I showed Lucia the building. On the paper. This paper.&#x201d; He took it out of his pocket and handed it to his therapist. By now the paper was becoming soft and wrinkled. While she studied the picture, Harry watched the second hand of the wall clock turn. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You found this?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t draw this.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I found it.&#x201d; He waited. &#x201c;I found it in a parking lot six blocks from here.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;All right. You showed Lucia this picture. And perhaps she called you harmless. Why did you think it so disturbing to be called harmless?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Because,&#x201d; Harry said, &#x201c;in this country, if you&#x2019;re harmless, you get killed and eaten. That&#x2019;s the way things are going these days. That&#x2019;s the current trend. I thought you had noticed. Perhaps not.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And why do you say that people get killed and eaten? That&#x2019;s an extravagant metaphor. It&#x2019;s a kind of hysterical irony.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, it isn&#x2019;t. I work in a bank and I see it happen every day. I mop up the blood.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see what this has to do with picking up young men and taking them to motels,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s back in the country of acting out. And what I&#x2019;m wondering is, what does this mean about your relationship with Lucia? You&#x2019;re endangering her, you know.&#x201d; As if to emphasize the point, she said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s wrong, what you did. And very, very dangerous. With all your thinking, did you think about that?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Harry didn&#x2019;t answer. Then he said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s funny. Everybody has a theory about what that building is. You haven&#x2019;t said anything about it. What&#x2019;s your theory?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This building?&#x201d; Harry&#x2019;s therapist examined the paper through her movie- victim glasses. &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s the Field Museum, in Chicago. And that&#x2019;s not a theory. It is the Field Museum.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>***<br>On Wednesday, at three a.m., Harry fixed his gaze on the bedroom ceil�ing. There, as if on a screen, shaped by the light through the curtains luffing in the window, was a public building with front pillars and curved arched windows and perhaps a clock. On the ceiling the pro�jected sun of Harry&#x2019;s mind rose wonderfully, brilliantly gold, one or two mind-wisp cumulus clouds passing from right to left across it, but not so obscured that its light could not penetrate the great public building into which men, women, and children&#x2014;children in strollers, children hand in hand with their parents&#x2014;now filed, shadows on the ceiling, lighted shadows, and for a moment Harry saw an explosive flash. <br>&nbsp;<br>Harry Edmonds lay in his bed without sleeping. Next to him was his girlfriend, whom he had planned to marry, once he ironed out a few items of business in his personal life and got them settled. He had made love to her, to this woman, this Lucia, a few hours earlier, with earnest caresses, but now he seemed to be awake again. He rose from bed and went down to the kitchen. In the harsh fluorescence he ate a cookie and on an impulse turned on the radio. The radio blistered with the econ�omy of call- in hatred and religion revealed to rabid-mouthed men who now gasped and screamed into all available microphones. He adjusted the dial to a call-in station. Speaking from Delaware, a man said, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a few places I&#x2019;d do some trouble to, believe me, starting with the Supreme Court and moving on to a clinic or two.&#x201d; Harry snapped off the radio. <br>&nbsp;<br>Now he sits in the light of the kitchen. He feels as dazed as it is possible for a sane man to feel at three thirty in the morning. I am not silly, nor am I trivial, Harry says to himself, as he reaches for a pad of paper and a no. 2 pencil. At the top of the pad, Harry writes, &#x201c;The next place I plan to bomb,&#x201d; and then very slowly, and with great care, begins to draw his own face, its smooth cleanshaven contours, its courteous half smile. When he perceives his eyes beginning to water, he rips off the top sheet with his picture on it and throws it in the wastebasket. The refrigerator seems to be humming some tune to him, some tune without a melody, and he flicks off the overhead light before he recognizes that tune. <br>&nbsp;<br>***<br>It is midday in downtown Five Oaks, Michigan, the time for lunch and rest and conversation, and for a remnant, a lucky few, it may be a time for love, but here before us is Harry Edmonds, an officer in the trust department at Southeastern Michigan Bank and Trust, standing on a street corner in a strong spring wind. The wind pulls at his tie and musses his hair. Nearby, a recycling container appears to have over�turned, and sheets of paper, hundreds of them, papers covered with drawings and illustrations and words, have scattered. Like a flock of birds, they have achieved flight. All around Harry Edmonds they are gripped in this whirlwind and flap and snap in circles. Some stick to him. There are glossy papers with perfumed inserts, and there are yellowing papers with four-color superheroes, and there are the papers with attractive unclothed airbrushed bodies, and there are the papers with bills and announcements and loans. Here are the personals, swirl�ing past, and there a flyer for a home theater big-screen TV. Harry Edmonds, a man uncertain of the value of his own life, who at this moment does not know whether his life has, in fact, any importance at all, or any future, lifts his head in the wind, increasing in volume and intensity, and for a moment he imagines himself being blown away. From across the street, the way he raises his head might appear, to an observer, as a posture of prayer. God, it is said, resides in the whirlwind, and certainly Harry Edmonds&#x2019;s eyes are closed and now his head is bowed. He does not move forward or backward, and it is unclear from the expression on his face whether he is making any sort of wish. He remains stationary, on this street corner, while all about him the papers fly first toward him, and then away. <br>&nbsp;<br>A moment later he is gone from the spot where he stood. No doubt he has returned to his job at the bank, and that is where we must leave him.</p></p><h2>Splintered Light: Logos and Language in Tolkien&#39;s World</h2><p>J. R. R. Tolkien is perhaps best known for The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, but it is in The Silmarillion that the true depth of Tolkien&#x2019;s Middle-earth can be understood. The Silmarillion was written before, during, and after Tolkien wrote The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. A collection of stories, it provides information alluded to in Tolkien&#x2019;s better known works and, in doing so, turns The Lord of the Rings into much more than a sequel to The Hobbit, making it instead a continuation of the mythology of Middle-earth. Verlyn Flieger&#x2019;s expanded and updated edition of Splintered Light, a classic study of Tolkien&#x2019;s fiction first published in 1983, examines The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings in light of Owen Barfield&#x2019;s linguistic theory of the fragmentation of meaning. Flieger demonstrates Tolkien&#x2019;s use of Barfield&#x2019;s concept throughout the fiction, showing how his central image of primary light splintered and refracted acts as a metaphor for the languages, peoples, and history of Middle-earth.</p><p>Verlyn Flieger is professor emerita of English at the University of Maryland where she teaches courses on Tolkien, medieval and modern literature, and comparative mythology. She has written three books on Tolkien: Splintered Light, A Question of Time, and Interrupted Music (all published by The Kent State University Press). She has also edited a critical edition of Tolkien&#x2019;s novella Smith of Wootton Major, and an expanded edition with notes and commentary of Tolkien&#x2019;s most influential theoretical essay, &#x201c;On Fairy-Stories.&#x201d;</p><h2>Reasons for Quilts: An Inspiring Treasury of Quilts and Their Stories with 9 Patterns on Bonus CD</h2><p>Incredible quilts and touching stories about the inspiration of quilt making.

McKillip now invites readers to discover a place that may only exist in the mystical wisdom of poetry and music. <br><br> Scholar Phelan Cle is researching Bone Plain-which has been studied for the last 500 years, though no one has been able to locate it as a real place. Archaeologist Jonah Cle, Phelan's father, is also hunting through time, piecing history together from forgotten trinkets. His most eager disciple is Princess Beatrice, the king's youngest daughter. When they unearth a disk marked with ancient runes, Beatrice pursues the secrets of a lost language that she suddenly notices all around her, hidden in plain sight.<br><br><p><b>View our feature on Patricia A.

She lives in Oregon.Declan smiled. "I offered to come. I wanted to hear what strange music has grown along the edge of the world."<p>They studied him curiously, all suspicion gone. "Another wanderer," one decided. "Like Nairn."</p><p>"Nairn."</p><p>They gestured toward the young harper. "He can play anything; he's been everywhere around the Marches. He's heard it all."</p><p>The golden eyes, glinting like coins, studied Nairn. Nairn, meeting the unblinking, dispassionate gaze, felt oddly as though his world had shifted sideways, overlapped itself to give him an unexpected vision of something he didn't know existed. The feeling echoed oddly in his memories. Astonished, he recognized it: the other time he had wanted something with all his bones and didn't know what it was.</p><p>Declan smiled. Wordless, Nairn tipped his harp in greeting. The older bard came over to him, sat on the bench beside him.</p><p>"Play," Declan urged. "Some song from the sea."</p><p>Nairn shook his head slightly, found his voice. "You first. They're all tired of listening to me by now, and so am I. Play us something from your world."</p><p>The men rumbled their agreement. Declan inclined his head and opened his harp case.</p><p>The harp came out dancing with light. Uncut jewels inset deeply into the face of the harp glowed like mermaid's tears, green, blue, red, amber in the firelight. The men shifted, murmuring with wonder, then were dead still as the harper played a slow, rich, elegant ballad the like of which Nairn had never heard. It left a sudden, piercing ache in his heart, that there might be a vast sea-kingdom of music he did not know and might never hear. The wanderer who had enchanted the pigs with his voice and had calloused his feet hard as door slats had glimpsed the castle in the distance, with its proud towers and the bright pennants flying over them. Such lovely, complex music was no doubt common as air within those walls. And there he stood on the outside, with no right to enter and no idea how to charm his way in. With a bladder-pipe?</p><p>The ballad ended. The men sat silently, staring at the harper.</p><p>"Sad," one breathed finally, of the princess who had fled her life on her own bare feet to meet her true love in secret, only to find him dead in their trysting bower with her husband's wedding ring lying in the hollow of his throat.</p><p>Another spoke, after another silence. "Reminds me of a ballad my wife sings. Only it's a sea-maid, not a princess, and her husband is sea-born as well, but her own true love is a mortal man, drowned by a wave and found in the sand with a black pearl on his throat."</p><p>Nairn saw a familiar kindling in Declan's eye. "Please," the bard said. "Sing it for me."</p><p>"Ah, no," the man protested, trying to shift to safety behind his friends. "I couldn't. Not for you."</p><p>"I'll sing with you," Nairn suggested promptly. "I know it."</p><p>You see? their faces told Declan as Nairn began. He knows everything.</p><p>They were all singing it toward the end, all the villagers with their voices rough as brine-soaked wool, trying to imitate the older bard's deep, tuned, resonant voice. Declan listened silently, harp on his knee, hands resting upon it. He was hardly moving. Maybe it was his breathing that kept the harp moving imperceptibly, the jewels glittering with firelight, then darkening, then gleaming again, catching at Nairn's eyes as he played. For the first time in his life he saw some use for what he only knew as words in poetry: gold, jewels, treasure. He was born poor; he took his music for free; it cost no more than air or water. But there were other songs, he realized, other music, maybe even other instruments secreted away where only those who possessed gold, wore jewels, were permitted to go.</p><p>The jewels, fair blue as sky, green as river moss, fire red, teased him, lured his eyes when he ignored them. He met Declan's eyes once, above the jewels; they told him nothing more than mist. He had stolen things in his life, but only to keep on living: eggs out of a coop, a cloak left on a bush to dry, a pair of sandals when his feet grew bigger than his shoes. Things he needed. Never anything like this. Never anything he wanted, mindlessly, with all his heart: these jewels, useless, brilliant, indolent creatures, doing no one any good, just flaunting their wealth and beauty on the face of a harp whose supple, tender voice would not change so much as a tremor if the jewels vanished.</p><p>He heard Declan's voice then, softly pitched to reach him beneath the singing.</p><p>"Take them. If you can."</p><p>He met the bard's eyes again, found them again wide, unblinking, oddly metallic, the pupils more like coins that human eyes. Like the jewels burning on his harp, they lured, teased, challenged.</p><p>Nairn dropped his eyes, pitched every note, sang every word of longing and passion in the ballad to all the music he had never heard, might never hear, the treasure-hoard of it, hidden away like forbidden love behind windowless walls, within indomitable towers.</p><p>He scarcely noticed when the ballad came to an end; he heard only the longing and loss in his heart. His fingers stilled. He heard an ember keen, a twig snap. No one spoke, except the fire, the wind, the sea. Then, as he stirred finally, he heard an odd ping against the flagstones, and then another, as though, beneath his feet, some very ancient instrument were turning itself.</p><p>Another.</p><p>He looked down, found the jewels had melted like tears down the harp face, slid to his feet.</p><p>He stared at Declan, whose eyes held a pleased, human smile. The men at the tables were beginning to shift a bone, draw a breath.</p><p>"They go where they are summoned," the bard said. "Take them. They came to you."</p></p><h2>Everything You&#39;d Better Know About the Record Industry</h2><p>Offers information for songwriters, performers and singers, and producers on the industry, including hiring managers and accountants, establishing a budget, and copyright and contract law</p><p>Everything You'd Better Know About the Record Industry is "must" reading for anyone seeking to engage the music business professionally.

Then everything changed. Peter opened his heart to the Scottish Fold kitten and their adventures to Paris, Fire Island, and in the subways of Manhattan took on the color of legend and mutual love. THE CAT WHO WENT TO PARIS proves that sometimes all it takes is paws and personality to change a life.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p><b>Peter Gethers&nbsp;</b>has spent almost a decade chronicling the life of his extraordinary cat. When he has some free time, he's also a novelist, publisher, and screenwriter. Under the pseudonym Russell Andrews, he has written the bestselling thrillers&nbsp;<i>Gideon&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Icarus</i>. He lives in New York City, Sag Harbor, and, luckily, Sicily.The humorous and touching memoirs of a man and his cat--a Scottish Fold named Norton who travels everywhere, especially deep into this reformed cat-hater's heart. When Gethers--publisher (Villard books), novelist (Getting Blue, 1987, etc.), and screen-writer--receives Norton as a present from a girlfriend, he's less than enthusiastic--but not for long. Though the girlfriend eventually goes by the wayside, Gethers and the cat fast become pals. Soon the highly personable puss is accompanying the not-quite-as-personable Gethers everywhere--to parties, Fire Island vacations, and business trips abroad (to work on screenplays with Roman Polanski)--and making friends with everyone from flight attendants to hotel managers. (Norton goes on beach walks with Gethers, romps around on Parisian rooftops, and generally leads as daring and worldly a life as is possible for a house pet.) Finally, after a series of failed human relationships, Gethers finds his true love, Janis, who takes years of convincing- -from human and feline (Norton is smitten with her, too)--that this is the real thing. After a happy/sad recounting of the death of Gethers's father, there's an upbeat ending: Gethers, Janis, and Norton settle into a cozy old house on Long Island. Aside from some repetition--Norton does many of the same endearing things wherever he goes--a charming and heartening account. (Line drawings.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

At the age of five, he was formally recognized by His Holiness the Sixteenth Karmapa and Tai Situpa as the ninth incarnation of the great Thrangu tulku. Because of the Chinese military takeover of Tibet, Thrangu Rinpoche, then twenty-seven, was forced to flee to India in 1959. He was called to Rumtek monastery in Sikkim, where the Karmapa has his seat in exile. Because of his great scholarship, he was given the task of preserving the teachings of the Kagyu lineage. He was appointed by H.H. the Dalai Lama to be the personal tutor for the Seventeenth Karmapa, and he was also the personal tutor of the four principal Karma Kagyu tulkus: Shamar Rinpoche, Situ Rinpoche, Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, and Gyaltsab Rinpoche. Thrangu Rinpoche established the fundamental curriculum of the Karma Kagyu lineage taught at Rumtek and founded numerous monasteries and nunneries, schools for Tibetan children, and medical clinics.

Barred from reentering Japan, where her business was originally based, she hopes to plan her upcoming wedding and find a market for the art objects she's stored locally. All hell breaks loose when Rei's cousin Kendall Johnson disappears during the opening dinner at Bento, leaving Rei with Kendall's twin toddlers. Then Bento's hostess approaches Rei for help in locating her Japanese-born mother, a war bride who went missing from her Virginia home more than 30 years earlier. Finally, sweet Aunt Norie arrives from Japan to help with the wedding preparations and ever-dependable Hugh makes himself scarce for propriety's sake.

It all starts with a little girl?s trip to view the museum?s treasures and the parallel journey of her runaway yellow balloon. Floating down Fifth Avenue, past Central Park, bumping into a very silly tea party at the Plaza Hotel, and even adding to a tumultuous performance at the Metropolitan Opera, the balloon becomes part of a hilarious panorama of scenes that seem to mirror the paintings and sculpture raptly viewed by the wide-eyed little girl. The result is an illuminating exploration of how life can be captured with both the blink of an eye, and the stroke of a brush. Real-life sisters Jacqueline Preiss Weitzman and Robin Preiss Glasser pooled their skills, ideas, and memories to create this very special collaboration. Ms. Glasser is the illustrator of Judith Viorst?s <i>Alexander, Who?s Not (Do You Hear Me? I Mean It!) Going to Move</i>.Jacqueline Preiss Weitzman lives in New York City.Robin Preiss Glasser lives in Newport Beach, California.</p><p><b>Jacqueline Preiss Weitzman</b> lives in New York City.Loaded with pizzazz, this wordless story takes readers on a great balloon chase that encompasses some of New York City's most celebrated sites. A grandmother and a girl holding a yellow helium balloon are stopped at the door of the Metropolitan Museum and a guard ties the forbidden toy to the banister, offering to keep an eye on it. The moment he turns away, a pigeon unties the balloon, and the guard is off and running to retrieve it. Detailed pen-and-ink drawings, punctuated with color to highlight the central action, show all the chaos that ensues, from Central Park to the Plaza Hotel to a production of Aida at the Metropolitan Opera. Into the scenes of mayhem, Glasser (Alexander, Who's Not [Do You Hear Me? I Mean It!] Going to Move) cleverly inserts reproductions of famous works of art, as viewed by the girl and grandmother, each a reflection of whatever action is going on around the balloon. In the onstage scene at the opera, for example, a dog walker, a zookeeper, a Plaza bellhop and others wreak havoc while the girl and her grandmother view an equally erratic painting (Autumn Rhythm) by Jackson Pollock. Some pairings work better than others, but Glasser's drawings capture all the energy and charm of a captivating city.

It deposited me in Grangeville, Idaho, at one o'clock on a warm June morning in 1976. </p> <p>Along the quiet streets, four-way blinker stoplights reflected in the windows of lifeless, one-story buildings. The movie theatre's marquee announced Smokey And The Bandit, but missing bulbs gave it a chicken-pox appearance. Several people in their early twenties, my bracket, crowded out of the theatre's double doors and headed for a pickup truck. </p> <p>I lowered my window. "Which way to Portland, Oregon?" </p> <p>"Go right, through Lewiston," one of them yelled. He surveyed my yellow 'seventy-three Eldorado. "Nice wheels. Hey! Want to party? We've got beer." </p> <p>I followed them to a house where a party was in progress, and introduced myself as Monty Montana. To show my appreciation for their hospitality, I opened my attache case and broke out cocaine and Thai sticks. I stuffed my thirty-eight special in my jacket. </p> <p>"Man, that's a lot of dope," someone said. "You get busted and you've had it." </p> <p>I blew him away. "I'd rather die than let a cop take me, and I'll kill any cop who tries!" </p> <p>There was a murmur of mixed approval and awe. Even in my drug stupor I realized they sized me up as a heavy trafficker. Who else would blow into town with a three-year-old Cadillac, lots of dope and a gun? Let them think it. I had left a trail of so many lies and half-truths, one more wouldn't hurt. </p> <p>Everyone wanted to buy stuff, and I had plenty. Besides, I needed cash to get to Oregon and to Uncle Truman, the only one who could help me. So the next day when a guy who was up on the dopers said he knew a place in Lewiston where both of us could sell stuff, I said, "Let's go." </p> <p>We parked my Caddy in the driveway and jumped in his jazzed up'fifty-six Plymouth drag car with a 426 Hemi. Attracted attention like blazes, but the guy's parents were important in town, so the cop probably left him alone. Not exactly like Monty "Montana" Christensen. </p> <p>I snugged the guy's pot stash under the seat and leaned back, remembering the judge who said, "I see no reason Monty need go to the reform school. Who will take custody of him?" </p> <p>And no one stepped forward. Not Mom, not Grandma. My stepdad, forget it, and my real dad didn't know about the problem. I went to reform school by default. </p> <p>We cut around a produce truck while the Plymouth driver slapped his hand to a rock song. I braced my feet and looked at him. Some of us were born on the right side of town. </p> <p>The Lewiston contact wasn't there. We got something to eat and got back to Grangeville about midnight. I wished we had made the trip in the Eldorado so I could let this guy off and go on my way. A bad feeling started in my stomach, and it wasn't from the fifth of wine I had with dinner. Something was up. </p> <p>We stopped in front of the house. My car sat in the driveway, but the bad gut feeling was still with me. I touched the bulge under my jacket where the gun rested in my belt. </p> <p>"You go in," I said. "Leave the motor running." </p> <p>"Sure, Montana. But it looks quiet. Got the coke on you?" </p> <p>"In my pocket." </p> <p>"Okay." He laughed. "Just don't run off with my stash." </p> <p>He went into the house. The faint grumble of a gearing down semi coming off the pass drifted throught the open car window. </p> <p>The fast as a diamondback rattler on its tail can strike, two guys in jeans and plaid shirts burst out of the front door and ran for the car. One braced an automatic, and light bounced off the other's shotgun. </p> <p>I had been set up. Those so called "nice people" were ripping me off. They would get my money and the couple ounces of coke I had left. I would be stranded. </p> <p>I slid to the driver's seat, but they were at the car, shoving the shotgun in one window and the automatic in the other. Straight at my head. </p> <p>"Freeze! Police!" </p> <p>My insides turned to liquid. Police! Possession and intent to deliver were both thirty years in Idaho. Sixty years. Not to mention priors. </p> <p>I lay over in the seat, punched "Drive" on the push button transmission, and jammed my foot down on the gas pedal. The car shot forward, and I grabbed the steering wheel with one hand trying to peer over the dashboard. </p> <p>Pop, pop, pop. They were shooting at the car. Then boom-boom. The shotgun went off. </p> <p>The car shimmied hard with a rupturing screech. The flat from the detonated tires sounded like tarps in the wind. I hung on, the steering wheel slippery in my sweaty hands. Rocks from the downhill gravel road machine-gunned the fenders, and the smell of burning rubber filled the inside of the car. </p> <p>Dead ahead another gravel road intersected. The Plymouth's nose hit the ground and bounced into weightlessness as it flew through the air. </p> <p>My throat was like a wound-up rubber band. I fumbled for my gun, but it dropped when we nose-dived. I gripped the steering wheel with one hand, got the coke with the other, and in mid-air threw the incriminating evidence out the passenger window. </p> <p>The next instant my body whiplashed as the car smashed to the ground, slid sideways and spun twice, then slammed against the curb and stopped. </p> <p>"Get out of the car, Monty!" I yelled at myself. "Get out of the car!" </p> <p>Coke and adrenalin combined forces, and my body seemed on the verge of exploding. I grabbed the door handle on the driver's side and pulled. It broke off in my hand. </p> <p>The police were maybe a block-and-a-half away. Where was the gun? I couldn't find it. My heart felt huge, as if there were nothing else in my body except its enormous pounding. I crawled out the passenger door and sprinted. </p> <p>"Stop! Police!" They shouted at me, but I kept running. Halfway through a big field I dropped to my hands and knees in the tall wet alfalfa, and crawled. I couldn't see where I was going. I ran into a barbed wire fence, climbed through and kept on. </p> <p>To my right, the porchlight on a trailer house illuminated a fat man with a rifle running out the door. He froze at the yell, "Police! You're under arrest!" </p> <p>I crouched down, biting at the wire cuts in my hand, and watched in disbelief as the cops had this poor guy on his face. He must have heard the shooting and noise, and thought he was under attack, so flew out of his house with his gun-and the cops thought it was me. </p> <p>That guy doesn't know how lucky he is they didn't kill him, I thought. I wished I could tell him I was sorry. I needed to tell a lot of people. Holly and Jared were at the top of the list. Then Uncle Truman who had believed in me. And Grandma. The Caddy wasn't worth it. </p> <p>A police car screamed up to the trailer, and a voice rang, "You idiots! The guy we want is six feet tall and slender. You think this guy's it? Spread out and find the right one!" </p> <p>I crawled away praying the dark would wrap around me. </p> <p></p> * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * <p>Paradise Trailer Court -- The softly lighted sign sent a faint buzz into the court's quiet darkness. But it wouldn't be quiet for long. </p> <p>An old bus converted into a camper sat apart from the nicer trailers. I looked hard at the double doors. They were ajar. I pushed them gently. Was someone there? Every blood vessel in my body seemed to bulge from terror and drugs. </p> <p>The doors opened and I listened. No sounds. I eased up the steps, pulled the door back, and locked it. I crept to the back. A pile of clothes lay beneath one of the bunks. I crawled under, pulled the clothes on top of me, and lay shaking. </p> <p>It didn't take long for the action to start. Sirens shrilled into the court. The bus's thinly curtained windows couldn't deflect the police car's red-and-blue lights flashing like whizzing gum balls. Floodlights glared and radios crackled instructions in high static to searchers who called to each other. </p> <p>I tried to stop trembling and not to breathe as I heard the bus doors rattle. "It's locked," someone said. I heard them poking around under me. </p> <p>Car engines gunned, and the occupants of other trailers yelled, "What's going on?" </p> <p>By degrees my body settled down under the hot, stuffy clothes. They must have looked for me for several hours. </p> <p>One by one the lights dissipated, and the cars left. I pushed aside a smelly blanket, and turned on a small radio. Maybe there was information about the chase. </p> <p>No news, and middle-of-the-night disc jockeys don't talk much. This one rolled Jim Croche singing "Time in a Bottle." That had been a favorite at the Jekyll and Hyde Bar in Billings where Holly and I met. Beautiful blue-eyed Holly...no, hazel eyes set in a face as smooth and clear as a Montana spring morning. God, I missed her. The song lyrics reached out to grab me. </p> <p>If I could put time in a bottle, <br>The first thing I would do, would be <br>Save everyday <br>Til eternity passes away- <br>And spend it all with you. </p> <p>I groaned, and the groan echoed in my ears as though from a bottomless grave. Oh, to imprison the time with Uncle Truman and afterward with Holly. To breathe its fragrance, sip its sweetness-the first time my life meant something, when it counted. </p> <p>But I would pour out the times that I screamed as an evil force tried to suck me into itself. </p> <p>I would pour out all the days I didn't want to remember.

An unmatched evocation of the exodus from Paris after the German invasion of 1940, and of life under the Nazi occupation, it was written by the esteemed French novelist Ir�ne N�mirovsky as events unfolded around her. This haunting masterpiece has been hailed by European critics as a <b>War and Peace</b><i> </i>for the Second World War.<br><br>Though she conceived the book as a five-part work (based on the form of Beethoven s Fifth Symphony), Ir�ne N�mirovsky was able to write only the first two parts, <i>Storm in June </i>and <i>Dolce</i>, before she was arrested in July 1942. She died in Auschwitz the following month. The manuscript was saved by her young daughter Denise; it was only decades later that Denise learned that what she had imagined was her mother s journal was in fact an invaluable work of art.<br><br><i>Storm in June</i> takes place in the tumult of the evacuation from Paris in 1940, just before the arrival of the invading German army. It moves vividly between different levels of society from the wealthy P�ricand family, whose servants pack up their possessions for them, to a group of orphans from the 16th arrondissement<b> </b>escaping in a military truck. N�mirovsky s immense canvas includes deserting soldiers and terrified secretaries, cynical bank directors and hapless priests, egotistical writers and hardscrabble prostitutes all thrown together in a chaotic attempt to escape the capital. Moving between them chapter by chapter, this thrilling novel describes a journey hampered and in some cases abandoned because of confusion, shelling, rumour, lack of supplies, bad luck and ordinary human weakness. Cars break down or are stolen; relatives are forgotten; friends are divided; but there are also moments of love and charity. Throughout, whether depicting saintly forbearance or the basest selfishness, <i>Storm in June </i>neither sweetens nor demonizes its characters; unsentimentally, with stunning perceptiveness, N�mirovsky shows the complexities that mean no-one is simply a hero or villain. <br><br>The second volume, <i>Dolce</i>, is set in the German-occupied village of Bussy. Again, N�mirovsky switches seamlessly between social strata, from tenant farmers to the local aristocracy. The focus, however, is on the delicate, secret love affair between a German soldier and the French woman in whose house he has been billeted; the passion, doubts and deceits of their burgeoning relationship echo the complex mixture of hostility and acceptance felt by the occupied community as a whole. N�mirovsky is amazingly sensitive in her depiction of changing, often contradictory emotions, but her attention to the personal is matched by her sharp-eyed discussion of small-town life and the politics of occupation. In this myth-dissolving book, the French villagers see the Germans as oppressive warriors, but also as handsome young men, and occupation does nothing to remedy the condescension and envy that bedevil relations between rich and poor. <br><b><br></b>Quite apart from the astonishing story of its survival, <b>Suite Fran�aise</b> is a novel of genius and lasting artistic value. Subtle, often fiercely ironic, and deeply compassionate, it is both a piercing record of its time and a humane, profoundly moving novel.</p><p>Ir�ne N�mirovsky was born in Kiev in 1903 into a successful banking family. Trapped in Moscow by the Russian Revolution, she and her family fled first to a village in Finland, and eventually to France, where she attended the Sorbonne. <br><br>Ir�ne N�mirovsky achieved early success as a writer: her first novel, <i>David Golder</i>, published when she was twenty-six, was a sensation. By 1937 she had published nine further books and <i>David Golder </i>had been made into a film; she and her husband Michel Epstein, a bank executive, moved in fashionable social circles. <br><br>When the Germans occupied France in 1940, she moved with her husband and two small daughters, aged 5 and 13, from Paris to the comparative safety of Issy-L Ev�que. It was there that she secretly began writing <b>Suite Fran�aise</b>. Though her family had converted to Catholicism, she was arrested on 13 July, 1942, and interned in the concentration camp at Pithiviers. She died in Auschwitz in August of that year.This stunning book contains two narratives, one fictional and the other a fragmentary, factual account of how the fiction came into being. Suite Francaise itself consists of two novellas portraying life in France from June 4, 1940, as German forces prepare to invade Paris, through July 1, 1941, when some of Hitler's occupying troops leave France to join the assault on the Soviet Union. At the end of the volume, a series of appendices and a biographical sketch provide, among other things, information about the author of the novellas. Born in Ukraine, Irene Nemirovsky had lived in France since 1919 and had established herself in her adopted country's literary community, publishing nine novels and a biography of Chekhov. She composed Suite Francaise in the village of Issy-l'Eveque, where she, her husband and two young daughters had settled after fleeing Paris. On July 13, 1942, French policemen, enforcing the German race laws, arrested Nemirovsky as a stateless person of Jewish descent. She was transported to Auschwitz, where she died in the infirmary on Aug. 17.<br><br>The date of Nemirovsky's death induces disbelief. It means, it can only mean, that she wrote the exquisitely shaped and balanced fiction of Suite Francaise&amp; almost contemporaneously with the events that inspired them, and everyone knows such a thing cannot be done. In his astute cultural history, The Great War and Modern Memory,Paul Fussell describes the invariable progression from the hastily reactive to the serenely reflective of writings about catastrophes: The significances belonging to fiction are attainable only as 'diary' or annals move toward the mode of memoir, for it is only the ex post facto view of an action that generates coherence or makes irony possible.<br><br>We can now see that Nemirovsky achieved just such coherence and irony with an ex post facto view of, at most, a few months. In his defense, Fussell had not heard of Suite Francaise, and neither had anyone else at the time, including Nemirovsky's elder daughter, Denise, who saved the leatherbound notebook her mother had left behind but refused to read it, fearing it would simply renew old pains. (Her father, Michel Epstein, was sent to Auschwitz several months after her mother and was consigned immediately to the gas chamber.) Not until the late 1990's did Denise examine what her mother had written and discover, instead of a diary or journal, two complete novellas written in a microscopic hand, evidently to save scarce paper. Denise abandoned her plan to give the notebook to a French institute preserving personal documents from the war years and instead sent it to a publisher. Suite Francaise appeared in France in 2004 and became a best seller.<br><br>From a purely aesthetic standpoint, the back story of Suite Francaise is irrelevant to the true business of criticism. But most readers don't view books from such Olympian heights, and neither, for that matter, do most critics. If they did, publishers' lists wouldn't be so crowded with literary histories and biographies, those chronicles of messy facts from which enduring art sometimes springs. In truth, Suite Francaise can stand up to the most rigorous and objective analysis, while a knowledge of its history heightens the wonder and awe of reading it. If that's a crime, let's just plead guilty and forge ahead.<br><br>Storm in June, the first novella of Suite Francaise, opens as German artillery thunders on the outskirts of Paris and those residents who have trouble sleeping in the unusually warm weather hear the sound of an air-raid siren: To them it began as a long breath, like air being forced into a deep sigh. It wasn't long before its wailing filled the sky. --New York Times</p><h2>Systematic Theology (2 Volume Set)</h2><p>Abridged edition.

Little is known about the Vedic people, who lived more than three thousand years ago in northern India: They left behind almost no objects, images, or ruins. They created no empires. Even the <i>soma</i>, the likely hallucinogenic plant that appears at the center of some of their rituals, has not been identified with any certainty. Only a "Parthenon of words" remains: verses and formulations suggesting a daring understanding of life.<br> "If the Vedic people had been asked why they did not build cities," writes Calasso, "they could have replied: we did not seek power, but <i>rapture</i>." This is the ardor of the Vedic world, a burning intensity that is always present, both in the mind and in the cosmos.<br> With his signature erudition and profound sense of the past, Calasso explores the enigmatic web of ritual and myth that defines the Vedas. Often at odds with modern thought, these texts illuminate the nature of consciousness more vividly than anything else has managed to till now. Following the "hundred paths" of the <i>Satapatha Brahma</i><i>n</i><i>a</i>, an impressive exegesis of Vedic ritual, <i>Ardor </i>indicates that it may be possible to reach what is closest by passing through that which is most remote, as "the whole of Vedic India was an attempt to <i>think further</i>."</p></p><p><p><b>Roberto Calasso</b> is the publisher of Adelphi Edizioni in Milan and is the author of many books. <i>Ardor </i>is the seventh part of a work in progress, following <i>The Ruin of Kasch</i>, <i>The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony</i>,<i> Ka</i>, <i>K.</i>, <i>Tiepolo Pink</i>, and <i>La Folie Baudelaire</i>.</p><p>I</p> <p>REMOTE BEINGS</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>They were remote beings. Remote not only from modern man but from their ancient contemporaries. Distant not just as another culture, but as another celestial body. So distant that the point from which they are viewed becomes almost irrelevant. Nothing much changes whether that point is today or a hundred years ago. For those born in India, certain words, certain forms, certain objects may seem familiar, like an invincible atavism. But they are scattered fragments of a dream whose story has been blotted out.</p> <p>We cannot be sure when or where they lived. When: more than three thousand years ago, though dates vary considerably between one scholar and another. Area: the north of the Indian subcontinent, but with no exact boundaries. They left no objects or images. They left only words. Verses and formulas that marked out rituals. Meticulous commentaries that described and explained those same rituals. At the center of which appeared the <i>soma</i>, an intoxicating plant that has not been identified with any certainty, even today. Even then they spoke of it as a thing of the past. They could, it seems, no longer find it.</p> <p>Vedic India had neither a Semiramis nor a Nefertiti. And not even a Hammurabi or a Ramses II. No Cecil B. DeMille has managed to film it. It was the civilization in which the invisible prevailed over the visible. Like few others, it was liable to be misunderstood. There is no point looking for help from historical events, since there is no trace of them. Only texts remain: the Veda, the Knowledge. Consisting of hymns, invocations, incantations in verse. Of ritual formulas and prescriptions in prose. The verses form part of highly complex ritual actions. They range from the double libation, <i>agnihotra</i>, which the head of the family has to carry out alone, each day, for almost his entire life, to the most impressive sacrifice&#x2014;the &#x201c;horse sacrifice,&#x201d; <i>a</i><i>s</i><i>vamedha</i>&#x2014;involving hundreds and hundreds of men and animals.</p> <p>The Aryas (&#x201c;the nobles,&#x201d; as Vedic men called themselves) ignored history with a disdain unequaled in the annals of any other great civilization. We know the names of their kings only through mention in the <i> </i><i>gveda</i> and anecdotes in the Brahma as and the Upani ads. They had no concern for leaving a record of their conquests. And those events about which we do have information deal not so much with exploits&#x2014;military or administrative&#x2014;but with knowledge.</p> <p>When they spoke of &#x201c;acts,&#x201d; they were thinking mostly about ritual acts. It is no surprise that they never founded&#x2014;nor ever attempted to found&#x2014;an empire. They preferred to think about the essence of sovereignty. They identified it in its duality, in its division between brahmins and <i>k</i><i> </i><i>atriyas</i>, between priests and warriors, <i>auctoritas</i> and <i>potestas.</i> These are the two keys, without which no door is opened, no kingdom governed. The whole of history can be considered in the light of these relations, which are constantly changed, adjusted, concealed&#x2014;in the double-headed eagles, in the keys of St. Peter. There is always a tension that wavers between harmony and deadly conflict. On this diarchy, and its endless implications, the Vedic civilization focused its attention with supreme and subtle clear-sightedness.</p> <p>Worship was entrusted to the brahmins. Government to the <i>k</i><i> </i><i>atriyas.</i> The rest was built on this foundation. But, like everything else that happened on earth, even this relationship had its model in heaven. A king and a priest were there as well: Indra was the king, B haspati the brahmin of the Devas, the chaplain to the gods. And only the alliance between Indra and B haspati could guarantee life on earth. But from the very beginning, between the two, there was a third figure: Soma, the object of desire. Another king, as well as an intoxicating juice. One who would behave ungraciously and elusively toward the two representatives of sovereignty. Indra, who fought to gain the soma, would in the end be banished by the very gods to whom he had presented it. And what of B haspati, the inapproachable brahmin with a voice of thunder, &#x201c;born in the cloud&#x201d;? King Soma, &#x201c;arrogant with the supreme sovereignty he had acquired,&#x201d; abducted B haspati&#x2019;s wife Tara and had intercourse with her. From his seed she gave birth to Budha. When the child was born, she laid him on a bed of <i>mu�ja</i> grass. Brahma then asked Tara (and it was the height of shame): &#x201c;Tell me, my daughter, is this the son of B haspati or of Soma?&#x201d; Tara then had to tell the truth, that he was the son of King Soma, that she had betrayed her husband. And she, the model for all wives, had to admit it, for otherwise no woman would have been believed again (though repercussions of the event continued to be felt, from eon to eon). And a bitter war had to be fought between the Devas and the Asuras, the anti-gods, before Soma was finally persuaded to return Tara to B haspati. The <i> </i><i>gveda</i> says: &#x201c;Terrible is the wife of the brahmin, if she is abducted; such a thing creates disorder in the highest heaven.&#x201d; That should have been enough for shortsighted humans, who sometimes asked why, and over what, the Devas and Asuras fought each other in the heavens, in those constant battles of theirs. Now they knew: over a woman. Over the most dangerous woman: over the wife of the most important of brahmins.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>There were no temples, no sanctuaries, no walls. There were kings, but they had no safe and clearly defined kingdoms. From time to time they moved around on chariots with spoked wheels. Those wheels were their great innovation: before them, the kingdoms of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had known only hard, solid, slow wheels. Whenever they stopped, their first concern was to build fires and to kindle them. Three fires: one circular, one square, and one the shape of a half moon. They knew how to bake bricks, but used them only for building the altar that was central to one of their rites. It was the shape of a bird&#x2014;a hawk or an eagle&#x2014;with outstretched wings. They called it the &#x201c;fire altar.&#x201d; They spent most of their time in an empty, gently sloping clearing where they busied themselves around the fires murmuring words and singing fragments of hymns. It was an unfathomable way of life, requiring long training. Their minds teemed with images. Perhaps this was also why they had no interest in fashioning and sculpting figures of the gods. As if, already surrounded by them, they felt no need to add others.</p> <p>When the people of the Veda descended into the Saptasindhu, the Land of the Seven Rivers, and then onto the Ganges plain, much of the area was covered by forest. They opened the way with fire, which was a god: Agni. They let him draw a web of burnt scars. They lived in temporary villages, in huts built on pillars, with cane walls and straw roofs. They followed the herds, moving continually eastward. Stopping sometimes before vast expanses of water. It was the golden age of the ritualists.</p> <p>Groups of men could then be seen some distance away from the villages, each group&#x2014;of around twenty&#x2014;some distance from the other, moving over bare spaces, around fires permanently lit, with a hut close by. A murmuring of voices could be heard from afar, scored with chants. Every detail of life and death was at stake, in that coming-and-going of men absorbed in their activity. But all this would not have been obvious to an outsider.</p> <p>There are very few tangible remains of the Vedic period&#x2014;no buildings survive, no ruins or traces of buildings. At most, a few meager fragments on show in various museums. Instead, they built a Parthenon of words: the Sanskrit language, since <i>sa</i><i> </i><i>sk</i><i> </i><i>ta</i> means &#x201c;perfect.&#x201d; So said Ren� Daumal.</p> <p>What was the underlying reason for not wanting to leave any traces? The Westerner, with his usual euhemeristic presumption, would immediately suggest the materials have perished in the tropical climate. But the reason is another&#x2014;and it is mentioned by the ritualists. If the only event of any importance is the sacrifice, then what should be done with Agni, the altar of fire, once the sacrifice is finished? They replied: &#x201c;After the completion of the sacrifice, it rises up and enters that bright [sun]. Therefore do not worry if Agni is destroyed, since he is then in that yonder orb.&#x201d; Every construction is temporary, including the fire altar. It is not a fixed object, but a vehicle. Once the voyage is complete, the vehicle can be destroyed. Thus the Vedic ritualists did not develop the idea of the temple. If such care was given to constructing a bird, it was to make it fly. What remained on earth was an inert shell of dust, dry mud, and bricks. It could be left behind, like a carcass. It would soon be covered once more with vegetation. In the meantime, Agni was in the sun.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The world was divided into two parts, village and forest. Each followed different rules. What applied to one was not true of the other&#x2014;and vice versa. All villages would one day be abandoned by their communities, as their seminomadic existence slowly moved on. No sacred places were fixed, umbilical, created once and for all, like temples. The sacred place was the scene for the sacrifice. It had to be chosen each time following set criteria: &#x201c;As well as being on high ground, that place shall be flat; and as well as being flat, it shall be firm; and as well as being firm, it shall slope eastward, since east is the direction of the gods; or otherwise it should face northward, as north is the direction of men. It shall be raised slightly to the south, because that is the direction of the ancestors. If it had been lower to the south, the sacrificer would have soon passed into the underworld; in this way the sacrificer will live long: that is why it is slightly raised to the south.&#x201d;</p> <p>High, flat, firm: these are the first requirements for the place of sacrifice. As if the intention was to define a neutral surface, a backdrop that brings perfect clarity to the action. This is the origin of the <i>stage</i> as a place ready to accommodate all possible meanings. How modern&#x2014;indeed, the very stage of modernity. The place must, first, be <i>high.</i> Why? Because the gods leave the earth from high ground. And men must imitate them. Then <i>firm.</i> Why? So that it has <i>prati</i><i> </i><i>h</i><i>a</i>, &#x201c;foundation.&#x201d; Then the place must <i>slope eastward</i>: once again, because east is the direction of the gods. But most important: <i>slightly raised to the south</i>, as if turning away from the direction of the ancestors. The dead lie there and the officiants would quickly slide toward death if the ground were to slope southward. In just a few words, by marking out an ordinary space in the mind&#x2019;s eye, among brushwood and stones, the blank setting has been described for every action. It is the first <i>locus</i>&#x2014;and here, at one and the same time, we are told how the world is made, where the gods have gone, and where death lies. What else do we have to know, before any gesture starts? The ritualists were obsessive in their instructions, but never bigoted.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>On the sacrificial ground there is little to see. It is bare, monotonous. But most of what happens cannot be seen: it is a journey into the invisible, fraught with danger, anguish, risk of ambush&#x2014;a hazardous voyage, like that so loved by Conrad, with a ship ill-matched to face the demands of the forces of nature. And it was one of Conrad&#x2019;s characters who explained the difference between the carefree manner of people living on land and the precision of anyone living at sea. Only the latter understand that one wrong step, one badly tied knot, could mean disaster. But an error on land can always be put right. The sea alone denies us that &#x201c;sense of security&#x201d; which leads to miscalculation.</p> <p>Though they must have had no great experience of oceans, but rather of majestic rivers, the Vedic people loved referring to an &#x201c;ocean,&#x201d; <i>samudr�</i>, <i>salil�</i>, whenever they spoke of anything to do with heaven. For the sky itself was the real ocean, the Milky Way, which continued right onto the earth. And there they found the first image of that continuum from which all ceremonial gestures and words sprang. Like prudent and wary seamen, they thought of that boat, that voyage, during various times of the rituals&#x2014;for example, at the beginning of a certain chant: &#x201c;The <i>bahi</i><i> </i><i>pavam</i><i>a</i><i>na</i> chant is in truth a boat heading toward heaven: the priests are its mast, and its oars are the means they use to reach the heavenly world. If one of them is unworthy, he alone will make [the boat] sink: he will make it sink in the same way that someone boarding a boat already full will make it sink. And in fact every sacrifice is a boat sailing heavenward: and so an unworthy priest must be kept away from any sacrifice.&#x201d;</p> <p>Though the sacrificial stage, to an outsider, seems like any other place, a tremendous concentration of forces dwells there&#x2014;and focuses on few objects: they are fragments of the &#x201c;thunderbolt,&#x201d; <i>vajra</i>, that supreme and mysterious weapon with which Indra defeated V tra, the enormous monster who kept the waters captive within himself. One object is the wooden sword that the officiants hold. Another is an element of terrifying simplicity: the post. But the cart that transports the rice is also a sacrificial force. And the arrow used by the warriors recalls the breaking of the <i>vajra</i> as it struck V tra. The separation of these objects between brahmins and <i>k</i><i> </i><i>atriyas</i>, between priests and warriors, is also a shrewd division of powers between the two forms of sovereignty whose balance is always at risk: the brahmins are responsible for the wooden sword and the post; and the <i>k</i><i> </i><i>atriyas</i> for the cart and the arrow. Two against two: the <i>k</i><i> </i><i>atriyas</i> closer to everyday life (the cart and the arrow are required by the tribe on the move and in battle); the brahmins more abstract, but none the milder for this (the wooden sword, the solitary post). The most incongruous object, much like a toy&#x2014;the <i>sphya</i>, the &#x201c;wooden sword&#x201d;&#x2014;is given to the brahmin. But it is also the only one of the four objects that represents the thunderbolt in its totality, as it was once brandished by Indra. Only a brahmin can hold the wooden sword, since it &#x201c;is the thunderbolt and no man can hold it: so he holds it with the help of the gods.&#x201d; When one reaches closest proximity to the gods, only a brahmin can act. The story of Indra&#x2019;s thunderbolt, however, explains why, from the beginning, power is never whole, but is split into two irreducible parts.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The fabric of relationships between <i>auctoritas</i> and <i>potestas</i>, between spiritual and temporal power, between brahmins and <i>k</i><i> </i><i>atriyas</i>, between the priest and the king: a perpetual and boundless theme in India from the <i> </i><i>gveda</i> to the <i>Mah</i><i>a</i><i>bh</i><i>a</i><i>rata</i> (which is all a story of plots and variants within these relationships) and to the Pura as (&#x201c;Antiquities&#x201d;). Complementary and sometimes hostile relationships: but such conflict was never expressed in the crude terms of a struggle between spirit and force. The brahmins&#x2019; ancestors were &#x201c;seers,&#x201d; the <i> </i><i>is</i>&#x2014;and first among them, the Seven Seers, the Saptar is, who dwelt in the seven stars of the Great Bear and held terrible destructive power. They were capable of swallowing up, parching, hurling thunderbolts at whole portions of the cosmos. The armies of a king were never as devastating as t...</p></p><h2>Buster Mesquite&#39;s Cowboy Band</h2><p>Buster Mesquite&#39;s Cowboy Band give a quirky southwestern retelling of a classic children&#39;s tale, with a much more satisfactory ending.

As Peter Jennings once put it, more than anyone else in legal studies, she "has made it easier for other women to seek justice." This collection, the first since MacKinnon's celebrated <i>Feminism Unmodified</i> appeared in 1987, brings together previously uncollected and unpublished work in the national arena from 1980 to the present, defining her clear, coherent, consistent approach to reframing the law of men on the basis of the lives of women. </p><p> By making visible the deep gender bias of existing law, MacKinnon has recast legal debate and action on issues of sex discrimination, sexual abuse, prostitution, pornography, and racism. The essays in this volume document and illuminate some of the momentous and ongoing changes to which this work contributes; the recognition of sexual harassment, rape, and battering as claims for sexual discrimination; the redefinition of rape in terms of women's actual experience of sexual violation; and the reframing of the pornography debate around harm rather than morality. The perspectives in these essays have played an essential part in changing American law and remain fundamental to the project of building a sex-equal future. </p></p><p><b>Catharine A.

He had this habit of breaking into other people's houses. It wasn't the big loot he was after, like his teenage cohorts. It was just that he liked to read other people's mail, pore over their family photo albums, and appropriate a few of their precious mementos.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for eleven years now, he's been working steadily for Rent-a-Back, renting his back to old folks and shut-ins who can't move their own porch furniture or bring the Christmas tree down from the attic. At last, his life seems to be on an even keel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, the Gaitlins (of "old" Baltimore) cannot forget the price they paid for buying off Barnaby's former victims. And his ex-wife would just as soon he didn't show up ever to visit their little girl, Opal. Even the nice, steady woman (his guardian angel?) who seems to have designs on him doesn't fully trust him, it develops, when the chips are down, and it looks as though his world may fall apart again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one like Anne Tyler, with her sharp, funny, tender perceptions about how human beings navigate on a puzzling planet, and she keeps us enthralled from start to finish in this delicious new novel.</p><p>Barnaby Gaitlin is one of Anne Tyler's most promising unpromising characters. At 30, he has yet to graduate from college, is already divorced, and is used to defeat. His mother thrives on reminding him of his adolescent delinquency and debt to his family, and even his daughter is fed up with his fecklessness. Still, attuned as he is to "the normal quota for misfortune," Barney is one of the star employees of Baltimore's Rent-a-Back, Inc., which pays him an hourly wage to help old people (and one young agoraphobe) run errands and sort out their basements and attics. Anne Tyler makes you admire most of these mothball eccentrics (though they're far from idealized) and hope that they can stave off nursing homes and death. There is, for example, "the unstoppable little black grandma whose children phoned us on an emergency basis whenever she threatened to overdo." And then there's Barnaby's new girlfriend's aunt, who will eventually accuse him of theft--"Over her forearm she carried a Yorkshire terrier, neatly folded like a waiter's napkin. 'This is my doorbell,' she said, thrusting him toward me. 'I'd never have known you were out here if not for Tatters.'" These people are wonderful creations, but their lives are more brittle than cuddly, Barnaby knows better than to think of them as friends, because they'll only die on him. Yet his job offers at least glimpses of roots and affection. Helping an old lady set up her Christmas tree (on New Year's Eve!) gives him the chance to hang a singular ornament--a snowflake "pancake-sized, slightly crumpled, snipped from gift wrap so old that the Santas were smoking cigarettes." And Barnaby himself is sharp and impatient at painful--and painfully funny--family dinners, apparently unable to keep his finger off the auto-self-destruct button every time his life improves. As much as his superb creator, he is a poet of disappointment, resignation, and minute transformation. <i>--Kerry Fried</i>"Anne Tyler writes like an angel....One of those books that readers close at the end and recognize the truth they contain."<br>--<i>USA Today</i><p>A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK</p><p>"A PERFECT GEM...TYLER'S BOOKS GET WISER, FUNNIER AND RICHER AS THEY GO."<br>--<i>The Seattle Times</i></p><p>"SO WONDERFULLY READABLE THAT ONE SWALLOWS IT IN A SINGLE GULP...What makes this novel so irresistible is the main character and narrator Barnaby Gaitlin, a 30-year-old misfit, a renegade who is actually a kind-hearted man struggling to find his place in the world."<br>--<i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i></p><p>"IF WE BELIEVE THAT SERIOUS NOVELS ARE ABOUT THE SEARCH FOR A TRUE HOME, THEN A PATCHWORK PLANET IS A NOVEL THAT REPAYS OUR ALWAYS DELIGHTED ATTENTION."<br>--Carol Shields, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"POSSESSES A TENDERNESS REMINISCENT OF BREATHING LESSONS...[Tyler] is beloved not just for her three-dimensional Baltimore or her quirkily intimate characters, but also for the small, heroic struggles they encounter in the course of a day."<br>--<i>The Boston Sunday Globe</i></p><p>"VINTAGE TYLER...A PATCHWORK PLANET TELLS THE HEART-TUGGING STORY OF THE SINS OF THE BOY BEING VISITED ON THE MAN."<br>--<i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>"FRESH AND ENGAGING."<br>--<i>Time</i></p><p>"Filled with insight and compassion, Anne Tyler's 14th novel chronicles a year in the life of a 30-year-old 'loser' named Barnaby Gaitlin....Tyler has crafted a remarkably lovable character, a young man as endearing as Macon Leary, the memorable protagonist of her 1985 bestseller, The Accidental Tourist."<br>--<i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></p><p>"What resonates throughout the novel is Tyler's gentle wisdom.

To the delight of the pro and novice alike, a fraction of the production has the added feature of hand embellishments engraving, gold inlaying, carved or checkered stocks, platings in gold and silver, and rich casings. Presentation inscriptions, one of the most choice appointments, have set a fraction of this already desirable group into a still higher category of rarity and desirability.<br> <br>The firm that Sam Colt founded in 1836 is the oldest manufacturer of repeating firearms in the world and possessor of one of history&#x2019;s most respected brand names.

This book is for anyone interested in learning the foundational ideas of systems thinking. SIMPLE RULES OF SYSTEMS THINKING Systems Thinking Made Simple doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re going to oversimplify it like a ... for Dummies book. It means that we will show how systems thinking emerges when we focus on a simple set of rules. After years of searching for unifying principles, many experts and practitioners in the field of systems thinking have embraced DSRP as universal to all systems thinking methods. Originally a complex mathematical formulation, DSRP has since been made more accessible through powerful modeling and visualization tools. There are two surprising things about our new understanding of systems thinking. First is how simple the four rules are: DISTINCTIONS RULE: Any idea or thing can be distinguished from the other ideas or things it is with SYSTEMS RULE: Any idea or thing can be split into parts or lumped into a whole RELATIONSHIP RULE: Any idea or thing can relate to other things or ideas PERSPECTIVES RULE: Any thing or idea can be the point or the view of a perspective.</p><p></p><h2>Don Troiani&#39;s American Battles: The Art of the Nation at War, 1754-1865</h2><p><li>Lavishly illustrated with full-color artwork, some of which can be found only in private collections </li><li>Contributors include some of military history's biggest names, such as Stephen W.

Scott Fitzgerald's tortured wife and muse, have been waiting impatiently since 1970 for Milford's promised follow-up about poet Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892-1950). It's finally here, and they will not be disappointed. Milford's vivid narrative limns an electric personality with psychological acuity while capturing the freewheeling atmosphere of America in the turbulent years following World War I. After "Renascence" was published (when she was only 20) and she moved to Greenwich Village, Millay was the queen of bohemia, taking lovers with zest and voicing the reckless gaiety of a generation in her famous lyric, "My candle burns at both ends; / It will not last the night; / But, ah, my foes, and, oh, my friends-- / It gives a lovely light." With her flame-red hair, milk-white skin, and a voice that thrilled audiences (making her poetry readings a welcome source of income), Millay was the archetypal "new woman": powerful, passionate, and not to be ignored. But Milford makes it clear that her first loyalty was to her mother and sisters, and her deepest commitment to her writing. This juicy chronicle has famous names aplenty--critic Edmund Wilson and <i>Masses</i> editor Floyd Dell were among the men devastated by her refusal to be faithful--and lots of dissipation: Millay drank heavily and became addicted to morphine. It also takes a perceptive look at how an artist draws material from her life and at the strategies she uses to protect the wellsprings of creativity. Brief passages interspersed throughout delineating Milford's interactions with Norma Millay, the poet's younger sister and literary executor, might have been self-indulgent and self-aggrandizing; instead they offer intriguing snapshots of the complex process by which biography is made. The resulting book is a tour de force, and wildly entertaining as well. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>after the smashing success of <b>Zelda</b>, Nancy Milford returns with a stunning second act. <b>Savage Beauty</b> is the portrait of a passionate, fearless woman who obsessed American ever as she tormented herself.<br><br>If F. Scott Fitzgerald was the hero of the Jazz Age, Edna St. Vincent Millay, as flamboyant in her love affairs as she was in her art, was its heroine. The first woman ever to win the Pulitzer Prize, Millay was dazzling in the performance of herself. Her voice was likened to an instrument of seduction and her impact on crowds, and on men, was legendary. Yet beneath her studied act, all was not well. Milford calls her book "a family romance"--for the love between the three Millay sisters and their mother was so deep as to be dangerous. As a family, they were like real-life <i>Little Women</i>, with a touch of <i>Mommie Dearest</i>.<br><br>Nancy Milford was given exclusive access to Millay's papers, and what she found was an extraord</p><h2>Scattered at Sea (Penguin Poets)</h2><p><b>A dazzling new collection from an award-winning poet--longlisted for the 2015 National Book Award for Poetry"</b><br><br>Amy Gerstler has won acclaim for sly, sophisticated, and subversive poems that find meaning in unexpected places. The title of her new collection, <i>Scattered at Sea</i>, evokes notions of dispersion, diaspora, sowing one&#x2019;s wild oats, having one&#x2019;s mind expanded or blown, losing one&#x2019;s wits, and mortality. Making use of dramatic monologue, elegy, humor, and collage, these poems explore hedonism, gender, ancestry, reincarnation, bereavement, and the nature of prayer. Groping for an inclusive, imaginative, postmodern spirituality, they draw from an array of sources, including the philosophy of the ancient Stoics, diagnostic tests for Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, 1950s recipes, the Babylonian Talmud, and Walter Benjamin&#x2019;s writing on his drug experiences.</p><p><b>AMY GERSTLER </b>is a writer of poetry, nonfiction, and journalism who lives in Los Angeles.

The wind flowed in his veins, and the sun itself seemed to shine through his eyes when he smiled.<br><br>Only Tazhi stood and faced them.<br><br>And for that, he was cut down. In a flash of reddening steel, Tazhi was sent to the afterlife, condemned to walk forever headless, and alone. <br><br>We were orphans of the Black Mountain Apache, Tazhi and I. Our mother had been slain by Mexican soldiers when Tazhi was a babe of ten moons old. Our father had gone from us two winters before that. He had ridden with warriors on a raid into Mexico; there they had been ambushed. Our father was one of many who did not return.<br><br>So Tazhi and I belonged to no one, and thus we belonged to everyone -- or Tazhi did.<br><br>When he was small, he had no mother to embrace him, so all the women of the tribe cuddled him, squeezing his plump limbs and tickling him until his laughs rang through the camp. As he grew bigger, he had no father to grapple and fight, so all the warriors wrestled him, delighting in his growing strength and fearless bravado. Golahka, that powerful young warrior,would play with Tazhi, although he had three children of his own. And slender Tehineh, Golahka&#x2019;s tenderhearted wife, would smile and look on quietly as she knelt beside the fire.<br><br>But it was I Tazhi turned to at night; I who held him through the long, black time when the coyote cried and the owl called. Tazhi would shut his eyes only when his head rested on my shoulder, and I would curl around his sleeping body to protect him from the unseen terrors of the dark.<br><br>We were at peace that summer, and happy to be so. The Mexican, it seemed, had tired of his endless war against my people and instead had invited us to trade. Thus the whole tribe left the settlement of tepees in our Black Mountain home and for many days traveled south across the flat plains, deep into Mexican territory. Tazhi and I moved lightly, ourhearts untroubled, our spirits soaring with delight to be roaming free across the land created by Ussen, the Life Giver, for the Apache.<br><br>Each night of our long journey we made camp, sleeping wrapped in blankets beneath the stars. By firelight, the old men of the tribe told tales, and Tazhi and I listened with eyes wide as they recounted how -- many lifetimes ago -- strangers who spoke the Spanish tongue had come from the south, butchering every tribe they met and putting whole settlements to the flame. Those they did not murder, they enslaved.<br><br>The Apache had held their freedom by moving high into the mountains where the strangers dared not venture. They kept themselves apart, and safe. But, in time, these Spanish men mingled their blood with those few of other tribes who survived their slaughter. Thus a new race was born: the Mexican, who now squatted greedily on Ussen&#x2019;s land and called it his own.<br><br>Conflict between the Apache and this murderous race was woven through our history like a red thread through a blanket. But now the blanket was folded and put away; there was to be no more warfareor bloodshed.<br><br>At last we stopped outside the Mexican town we call Koskineh. There Tazhi and I sniffed the air; the faint scent of cooking spices drifting from the dwellings thrilled us with its strangeness.<br><br>In the dip of a broad, open valley, where the river ran cool and clear, our tribe bent saplings and cut brushwood to fashion into wickiup shelters. We gathered wood and built fires, setting pots of meat bubbling in the flames.<br><br>For some days all was calm. In the mornings, the warriors went to trade in the town, leaving behind a small guard for the protection of the women and children.<br><br>I was then in my fourteenth summer and was counted a woman. In the absence of my own mother, Nahasgah -- mother of Golahka -- had been trying to teach me the skills of womanhood that I should have mastered many, many moons ago. I had no aptitude for the tasks she set me. Myfingers were clumsy when they attempted to coil baskets and stupidly awkward when they tried to tan a deerskin. I could not scrape free the hair without nicking the outer surface, and thus each hide I worked became worthless.<br><br>To make weapons was a different thing. As soon as Tazhi could walk, I had fashioned him a small bow and a quiver full of arrows. Other boys played with sharpened sticks, but for Tazhi I made arrowheads of stone, the flint shaping easily beneath my fingers. <br><br>On our third day outside Koskineh, I made Tazhi a spear.<br><br>It was not the full length of a grown warrior&#x2019;s lance, and yet it was no plaything. The weapon stood taller than Tazhi but was well weighted so he could thrust it with ease. The head was long and slender, crafted from a dark flint, as sharp as the blade of the knife that all Apache carry. The shaft I had decorated with an eagle&#x2019;s feathers; I had found them on ourjourney, lying on the ground before me, as though a gift from the bird above.<br><br>When the warriors returned from trading that night, Tazhi, armed with his new weapon, barred their way. He singled out Golahka, shaking hisspear threateningly, vowing to slay the warrior if he took another step.<br><br>Golahka&#x2019;s dark eyes glinted with seeming terror as he held his hands up placatingly. Tazhi drove him back, ordering, "Away, miserable coyote! Away from my women! Away from my children! Away, away!" And Golahka fled from the camp, screaming like a maiden.<br><br>There was much laughter among the women and warriors, and Tehineh smiled. Tazhi did not. In his fourth summer, he stood proud as a mighty warrior, believing in his victory.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Lew Burke&#39;s Dog Training</h2><p>a must have for training your dog</p><p></p><h2>Country French cooking (A Sunset book)</h2><p>From Brittany and Normandy in the north, via the Loire, Burgundy and the Auvergne to the Pyrenees and Provence in the south, the cooking of regional France is justly renowned for the quality of its ingredients, the delicious dishes created from them and the infinite variety of local wines to accompany them.

Soon sick of the bonanza society, he emigrated to a shallow harbor called Shoalwater Bay (now Willapa Bay) north of the Columbia River in Washington Territory.<br><br>Swan eagerly became a part of the frontier community, enjoying the company of both the white settlers and friendly Indians in the area. First published in 1857, his classic account of the western frontier remains fresh and timely for the modern reader. Swan saw himself as both an observer and participant in a barbaric invasion. His interest in the Indians and his acceptance of them as individuals of importance and integrity emerge clearly in a lively and informed narrative.</p><p>"This account by a renegade Bostonian, who lived among the Indians at Willapa Bay, is particularly valuable because it shows us a man who was both a sensitive observer and participant in the white settlers' invasion of the Indians' lands..As the earliest book about Washington Territory, <i>The Northwest Coast</i>, according to Murray Morgan, 'sets a standard few other works about the area have met.

Baraka's engaging and prophetic portraits of Sonny Rollins, Wayne Shorter, Bobby Bradford, Cecil Taylor, Thelonious Monk, Roy Haynes, Don Cherry, and John Coltrane (whom he called "the heaviest spirit") beam with an electric and fluid language that mirrors those artists' speed-of-light improvisations. In "Jazz and the White Critic," which blasts white critics who judge jazz by European, rather than African American, standards, Jones wrote, "As Western people, the sociocultural thinking of 18th-century Europe comes to us as history and legacy that is a continuous and organic part of the 20th-century West. The sociocultural philosophy of the Negro in America ... is no less specific and no less important for any intelligent critical speculation about the music that came out of it." His analysis of the burgeoning avant-garde scene in "Apple Cores #1-6," "New York Loft and Coffee Shop Jazz," and "The Jazz Avant-Garde" accurately depicts the artistic promise and peril of that period in the words of a literary genius who was there and helped create it. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i>[This collection of pieces] written in the 1960&#39;s provides a clear picture of where one segment of the modern Negro community stands musically--and socially. . . .

Phillips in his introduction to <i>Ernest Hemingway on Writing</i>, "he maintained that it was bad luck to talk about writing." Hemingway seems to have courted bad luck. Phillips has amassed a slender book's worth of Hemingway's reflections on writing, culled from letters, books, interviews, speeches, and an unpublished manuscript. These musings are arranged into topics such as "Advice to Writers," "Working Habits," and "Obscenity" (of which there is plenty here). Sometimes ponderous, other times offhand, these thoughts form a portrait of a man driven to create not solely the best writing he could, but the best writing, period. Hemingway craved exactness, both in his work and in the work of others; he strove to make every word necessary. "Eschew the monumental," he wrote to Maxwell Perkins in 1932. "Shun the Epic. All the guys who can paint great big pictures can paint great small ones." His aim? Mere perfection. "I write one page of masterpiece to ninety one pages of shit," he confided to F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1934. "I try to put the shit in the wastebasket." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i><b>Ernest Hemingway</b> did more to change the style of English prose than any other writer in the twentieth century, and for his efforts he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1954. Publication of <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> immediately established Ernest Hemingway as one of the greatest literary lights of the twentieth century. As part of the expatriate community in 1920s Paris, the former journalist and World War I ambulance driver began a career that led to international fame. He covered the Spanish Civil War, portraying it in fiction in his brilliant novel <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls,</i> and he subsequently covered World War II. His classic novella <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. He died in 1961.</p><h2>Identity&#39;s Architect: A Biography of Erik H. Erikson</h2><p>One of the most profound thinkers of the twentieth century, Erik H. Erikson was the architect of the &#34;identity crisis&#34; and the &#34;life cycle&#34; -- concepts that are now a familiar part of today&#39;s culture. Identity&#39;s Architect is the first comprehensive and authorized biography of Erikson, postwar America&#39;s most influential psychoanalyst, who acutely reshaped our views of human development. Drawing on private materials and extensive interviews with Erikson&#39;s family, students, and closest colleagues around the world, award-winning historian Lawrence J. Friedman illuminates the relationship between Erikson&#39;s personal life and his groundbreaking ideas. This book lays bare the identity crisis that was at the root of this remarkable man&#39;s lifelong quest to discover who his father was. Friedman insightfully shows how Erikson&#39;s famous eight-stage model of the human life cycle grew from the birth of his third son, who was born developmentally handicapped. Even Erikson&#39;s acclaimed studies of Luther, Gandhi, Jefferson, and Jesus were inseparable from his life circumstances. The writing and ideas of Erik Erikson have had a remarkably lasting influence on our culture. Erikson&#39;s fascination with India and with Gandhi earned him the Pulitzer Prize for his book Gandhi&#39;s Truth and foreshadowed the contemporary West&#39;s growing interest in Eastern thought. His students at Harvard in the 1960s have gone on to great prominence -- Carol Gilligan, Robert Coles, Mary Catherine Bateson, and Howard Gardner to name a few. Trained in Vienna by Sigmund and Anna Freud, Erikson came to depart from psychoanalytic orthodoxy in deeply innovative ways -- insisting that social circumstances were no less important than the inner psyche in determining human personality. This exhaustively researched, compelling biography, which has been ten years in the making, is indispensable for anyone who hopes to fully understand one of the most significant intellectual figures of our time.</p><p><b>Lawrence J.

Erikson had reached the peak of his influence and popularity. Elegantly dressed in tweed jacket, blue shirt, and white moccasins, with a mane of white hair and rosy complexion, he seemed to resonate charisma and charm. He appeared on the covers of widely circulating newsmagazines as the founder of the life cycle and the identity crisis. Speaking invitations, honors, and honorary degrees abounded. Erikson enjoyed a reputation among Harvard students, graduates and undergraduates alike, as an inspirational, relevant, and profound gurulike instructor. He was sought out in advisory capacities not only by academic and psychiatric facilities but by a high official in the administration of New York's mayor John Lindsay, by members of the Kennedy family, and by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the Nixon White House. He won a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award for <i>Gandhi's Truth,</i> which propounded a political ethic that could lead the world from the brink of nuclear war while addressing America's brutality in Vietnam. </p><p> Growing public acclaim seemed to have an effect upon this habitually quiet, understated man. He displayed a new buoyancy and assurance -- almost a prophetlike quality. When he spoke reassuringly and approvingly to a young admirer, both regarded it as a devout and sacred ritual of mutuality. Robert Abzug, a young Danforth Graduate Fellow, would never forget a special conference in northern California where Erikson had lectured on Ingmar Bergman's classic film <i>Wild Strawberries.</i> Afterward, Abzug found himself walking along a nearby beach, saw Erikson, approached him, and offered an interpretation of a key scene in the film that Erikson had not made -- Isak Borg, the main character, had never been able to wholly connect himself to his parents. Later in the conference, Erikson took Abzug aside, touched him gently on the shoulder, looked him deeply in the eye, and said that Abzug had been right in his observation on the film. This was a special moment for both. The young man sensed that he had been respected, even blessed, by a strong, unwavering prophet. Abzug gained accreditation, and Erikson felt confident that he had a devoted student of yet another generation. </p><p> It is not easy to detect, from what is known of his early years, the roots of this show of confidence and inner strength in Erikson's late-life relationship. Young Erik seemed desperately to need a wise and giving adviser, such as he later became. Born out of wedlock and later adopted by his mother's second husband, he did not know who had fathered him. The problem was exacerbated by what he called the loving deceit of his mother and foster father; they had misled him for years. "Adoption was the great theme of Erikson's existence," recalled his closest childhood friend, Peter Blos. "He talked about it all the time." In an autobiographical essay written late in his life, Erikson noted that "a stepson's negative identity is that of a bastard" and provides no sense of belonging. Such a person "might use his talents to avoid belonging quite anywhere...." Nonetheless, Erikson felt that deceit and illegitimacy did not set his early decades entirely on a downhill course. A "different background" also came to signify very special circumstances and a destiny that he came to accept "as a fact of life." The sense of being extraordinary was facilitated by "the pervasive love and essential stability of my childhood milieu," even with the deceptions, and by the willingness of those closest to him "to let me develop my talents and choose my own life course." </p><p> Early circumstances therefore sapped and constricted young Erik. But they may also have inspired and motivated him. Despite his well-known eight-stage universal model of the human life cycle, which distributed the first two decades of life among five separate and distinct stages, he saw his own early life as a single unified stage that encompassed the entire flow of events from his birth to young adulthood. In his autobiographical essay, he characterized this stage as both broadly constrictive and energizing. Debilitating consequences were balanced by elevating ones. </p><p> Drawing upon that essay and other of Erikson's late-life reflections, it is important to determine why he regarded his infancy, childhood, youth, and young adulthood as part of a continuous and unified developmental stage -- his essential beginning. Adult reflections on childhood feelings and experiences carry complex and varied agendas, to be sure, along with internal contradictions. Nevertheless, we must honor Erikson's quest to see unity in his early life by seeking out materials that lend themselves to a cohesive story even as we introduce other data that destabilize the story. </p><p><br> <b>A Matter of Parentage</b> </p><p> Erik's mother, Karla Abrahamsen, came from a prominent Jewish family in Copenhagen that traced its genealogy back to the seventeenth century and the north of Germany. The men tended toward merchant and trade callings. There was a rabbi, a church historian, and even a Lutheran minister in the family tree, indicating some intermarriage. In addition to child-rearing duties, Abrahamsen women had maintained a tradition of embroidery and the painting of porcelain. All were "ladies" and employed housekeepers. Unlike Eastern European Jews in Copenhagen, the Abrahamsens tried to appear Danish. They spoke no Yiddish and blended the requirements of kosher food with traditional Danish dishes. </p><p> Karla's father, Joseph, was a prominent dry-goods wholesaler. Her mother, Henrietta Kalckar, died when Karla was fifteen, leaving her in the care of aging Abrahamsen aunts. Joseph required the brightest of his three sons, Axel, to forsake law and join his business, now "Abrahamsen and Son." Axel went on to become a very prominent figure in the textile industry and a leader in several of the city's Jewish charities. When Joseph died in 1899, Axel largely assumed leadership over Abrahamsen family affairs. Max, Joseph's second son, worked under Axel in the family dry-goods warehouse but died at twenty-two. Two other sons, Nicholai and Einar, established their own businesses as local jewelers. Einar became a respected gemologist. Like Axel, they were active in local Jewish charities. Matilda, Axel's wife, helped run a local soup kitchen for Russian-Jewish immigrants. </p><p> While Axel succeeded his father as the director of larger family affairs, his sister, Karla, emerged as the family's most remarkable member. She was the most beautiful Abrahamsen in memory, brilliant, and deeply intellectual. Indeed, she was one of the few women in the community to attend gymnasium. Unquestioning in her Judaism, she nonetheless read Kierkegaard devotedly and was taken with his culturally Danish but decidedly Christian appeal. Karla's father and brother respected and adored her. But they worried about her disposition to act on impulse and her interest in unconventional artists and craftspeople. Because Karla's mother had died when she was young, they feared that she was untutored in the sexual proprieties honored by her family and her class. </p><p> In 1898, Karla, at twenty-one, married a twenty-seven-year-old Jewish stockbroker, Valdemar Isidor Salomonsen. Little is known about him. Valdemar's father, Abraham, a lawyer, was on friendly terms with the Abrahamsens. His mother, Thora, was the daughter of the well-known portrait painter David Monies. Karla's marriage to Valdemar did not last a night and was probably unconsummated. She wired Axel from her honeymoon destination in Rome to take her home. By the time Axel arrived, Valdemar had fled to either Mexico or the United States. Family lore has it that after the wedding ceremony he informed Karla of his dealings in crime, fraud, and some financial irregularities that required him to beco</p></p><h2>Lenin Selected Writings</h2><p>The essential writings of Lenin, in a single volume, for the radical revolutionaries of today and tomorrow.</p><p></p><h2>Random House Webster&#39;s Word Menu</h2><p>"DESTINED TO TAKE ITS PLACE BESIDE THE THESAURUS AND THE DICTIONARY AS A CLASSIC."<br>--L.

Bye."</p><p> </p><p>Laura dumped the receiver on the floor, burrowed under the pillow and slid blissfully back into sleep.</p><p> </p><p>Twenty minutes later she was rudely awakened with a shake and a curse. "Damn it, Laura, you did it again."</p><p> </p><p>"What?" She shot up in bed, dark eyes wide and glazed, black hair tangled. "What?"</p><p> </p><p>"Left the phone off the hook." Julia MacGregor fisted her hands on her hips and smoldered. "I was expecting a call."</p><p> </p><p>"I, ah&#x2014;" Her mind was an unfocused blur. Laura shoved her hands through her sleep-tousled hair, as if to clear it. Mornings were just not her time of day. "I think Grandpa called. Maybe. I can't remember."</p><p> </p><p>"I didn't hear the phone." Julia shrugged. "I guess I was in the shower. Gwen's already left for the hospital. What did Grandpa want?" When Laura continued to look blank, Julia laughed and sat on the edge of the bed.</p><p> </p><p>"Probably just the usual. </p><p>"Your grandmother's worried about you."</p><p> </p><p>"I seem to remember something about that." Smiling a little, Laura plopped back onto the pillows. "If you'd gotten out of the shower faster, you'd have caught the call. Then Grandma would have been worried about you."</p><p> </p><p>"She was worried about me last week." Julia checked her antique marcasite watch. "I've got to run look at this property in Brookline."</p><p> </p><p>"Another one? Didn't you just buy another house last month?"</p><p> </p><p>"It was two months ago, and it's nearly ready to turn over." Julia shook back her curling mane of flame-colored hair. "Time for a new project."</p><p> </p><p>"Whatever works for you. My big plan was to sleep until noon, then spend the rest of the afternoon on a brief." Laura rolled her shoulders. "Fat chance around here."</p><p> </p><p>"You'll have the place to yourself for the next few hours. Gwen has a double shift at the hospital, and I don't expect to be back until five."</p><p> </p><p>"It's not my night to cook."</p><p> </p><p>"I'll pick something up."</p><p> </p><p>"Pizza," Laura said immediately. "Double cheese and black olives."</p><p> </p><p>"It's never too early for you to think about dinner." Julia rose, smoothed down the moss-green jacket she wore over pleated trousers. "See you tonight," she called on her way out. "And don't leave the phone off the hook."</p><p> </p><p>Laura studied the ceiling, contemplating the sunlight, and considered pulling the covers back over her head. She could sleep another hour. Dropping off at will or whim had never been a problem for her, and the skill had served her well in law school.</p><p> </p><p>But the idea of pizza had stirred her appetite. When there was a choice between sleep and food, Laura faced her biggest dilemma. Laura tossed the covers back as food won the battle. She wore a simple white athletic T-shirt and silk boxer shorts in electric blue.</p><p> </p><p>She'd lived with her two female cousins all through college and now for two years in the house in Boston's Back Bay. The thought of grabbing a robe never occurred to her. The attractive little townhouse&#x2014;one of Julia's recent renovations, and their newest home&#x2014;was decorated with an eclectic mix of their three tastes. Gwen's love of antiques vied with Julia's appreciation for modern art and Laura's own attraction to kitsch.</p><p> </p><p>She jogged downstairs, trailing her fingers over the satin finish of the oak railing, glanced briefly through the etched-glass window in the front door to see that it was indeed a brilliantly sunny fall morning, then swung down the hall toward the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>Though each of the cousins had a fine mind, conscientiously applied to their individual areas of expertise, none of them was especially gifted in that particular room. Still, they'd made it homey, with soft yellow paint setting off the deep blue counters and glass-fronted cabinets.</p><p> </p><p>Laura had always been grateful that the three of them had melded so well. Gwen and Julia were her closest friends, as well as her cousins. Along with the rest of the MacGregor brood, as Laura thought of them, the extended kin of Daniel and Anna were a close-knit, if diverse, family.</p><p> </p><p>She glanced at the sapphire-blue cat clock on the wall, its eyes diamond-bright, its tail swinging rhythmically. She thought of her parents and wondered if they were enjoying their much-deserved holiday in the West Indies. Undoubtedly they were. Caine and Diana MacGregor were a solid unit, she mused. Husband and wife, parents, law partners. Twenty-five years of marriage, the raising of two children and the building of one of the most respected law practices in Boston hadn't dimmed their devotion.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn't conceive of the amount of effort it took to make it all work. Much easier, she decided, to concentrate on one thing at a time. For her, for now, that was law. Correction, she thought, and grinned at the refrigerator. For right now, that was breakfast.</p><p> </p><p>She snagged the Walkman lying on the counter and slipped on the headphones.

The kind of car and color, he mused, that screamed out, <i>Officer, another speeding ticket here, please!</i> He shook his head at it, then shifted his gaze to study the house.</p><p> </p><p>It was a beaut. That was to be expected in this ritzy area of the Back Bay&#x2014;and given the lineage of the owners. Boston was the Red Sox and Paul Revere. And Boston was the MacGregors.</p><p> </p><p>But he wasn't thinking of money or class as he studied the house. His cool blue eyes scanned windows and doors. A lot of glass, he mused, while the crisp autumn breeze ruffled his thick, mink-colored hair. A lot of glass meant a lot of access. He started down the flagstone walk, with its brilliant edgings of fall blooms, then cut across the neat sloping lawn to consider the atrium doors that opened onto a small patio.</p><p> </p><p>He tested them, found them locked. Though one good kick, he thought, one good yank, and he'd be inside. His eyes stayed cool, his mouth hardened in a face full of planes and angles. It was a face the woman he nearly married had once called criminal. He hadn't asked her what she meant by that as they'd been well into their skid by then, and he just hadn't wanted to know.</p><p> </p><p>It could be cold, that face, and was now, as he calculated access into the lovely old house, which undoubtedly was packed with the antiques and jewelry rich women of a certain class enjoyed. His eyes were a pale, chilly blue that could warm and deepen unexpectedly. His mouth was a firm line that could curve into charm or straighten to ice. A small scar marred his strong chin, the result of abrupt contact with a diamond pinkie ring that had ridden on a curled fist. He skimmed just under six feet, with the body of a boxer, or a brawler.</p><p> </p><p>He'd been both.</p><p> </p><p>Now, as the freshening breeze whipped the wave of his collar-length hair into disarray, he decided he could be inside with pitifully little effort in under thirty seconds.</p><p> </p><p>Even if he didn't have a key to the front door.</p><p> </p><p>He walked back around, gave a quick, loud series of buzzes on the doorbell while he gazed through the fancy glass of the entryway. Looked pretty, he thought, with the etching of flowers on frosted glass. And was about as secure as tinfoil.</p><p> </p><p>He buzzed one more time, then took the key out of his pocket, slid it into the lock and let himself in.</p><p> </p><p>It smelled female. That was his first thought as he headed down the hallway toward a noise, and as he stepped through the doorway into a sunny kitchen, his face split with a grin of pure male appreciation.</p><p> </p><p>She was a long one, he thought, and most of it was leg. The smooth, golden length of them more than made up, in his estimation, for the complete lack of vocal talent. And the way she was bending over, head in the fridge, hips bumping, grinding, circling...</p></p><h2>The Watchers</h2><p>A compelling account of Betty Andreasson Luca&#39;s close encounters with alien beings describes her abduction and examination by them, her visit to their world, and her subsequent amnesia and nightmares</p><p>Betty Anreasson Lucas&#39;s UFO abduction case has long been famous for the vividness of her recall under hypnosis and the detailed inner consistency of her story. But recently a breathtaking array of previously unknown extraterrestrial encounters has come to light. They reveal the secret, disturbing prime motive behind the abductions of Betty Andreasson Lucas and many others throughout history--and the ultimate design the alien&#39;s presence on earth and in our lives. When Lucas discovered this astonishing secret, she gave the beings a name. She calls them the Watchers. Here is a vivid, fully documented picture of the abduction phenomenon as experienced by Betty and many others, including author Raymond E. Fowler himself. The many points of agreement among disparate abductees--such as physical descriptions of alien beings, examinations, experiments, and out-of-body experiences--suggest that not only are we indeed being visited, but we have been for many years. The Watchers brings us closer to the visitors than ever: we see their amazing equipment, their scientific knowledge and power, and the shattering consequences of what they know about our present and our future. This explosive book gives new meaning to the tantalizing mysteries whose solutions lie in the message no one on this planet can ignore.This is Fowler's third, and perhaps strangest, book about Betty Andreasson (now Mrs. Robert Luca). There is a little bit of everything here--out-of-body/near-death experiences, Christian spirituality, and ancient astronauts. By way of hypnotic regression, Luca was able to provide details about her numerous abductions, and her drawings, included in this book, clarify her verbal descriptions of alien machinery and enigmatic activities. The "secret design" behind alien abductions, says Luca, is a long-term genetics program undertaken by the aliens to prolong and improve life on the Earth. Fowler's objectivity in reporting these amazing experiences is called into question with his recent "discovery" of his own, up to now repressed, abduction experiences. Still, this book will be popular at public libraries with strong patron interest in UFO abduction.<br><i>- Gary D.

Richard Kiepfer, testimony before the <i>Liberty</i> court of inquiry</blockquote><p>Ensign John Scott strode out of the wardroom with a cup of black coffee in one hand and his new Polaroid in the other when the first explosion rocked the ship. An announcement over the loudspeaker moments earlier had warned sailors to stand clear of the twenty-six-foot motor whaleboat suspended on a davit about ten feet above the starboard deck. Crews had planned a routine test of the whaleboat's engine. When the explosion occurred, Scott thought the maintenance crew had dropped the whaleboat to the deck below. After he heard the secondary explosions, Scott realized that the <i>Liberty</i> was under attack. He threw his coffee to the deck and sprinted to his battle station in Damage Control Central. He paused only long enough to toss his Polaroid camera onto the floor of his stateroom before he jumped down the ladder to the deck below, his arms sliding on the rails. Scott arrived inside his office before the general quarters alarm sounded.</p><p>Scott assumed that the Egyptians had shelled the <i>Liberty</i> with artillery from shore. The spy ship had sailed much of the morning within sight of land. But the staccato attacks followed by a brief lull and then resumption of fire meant it had to be fighter planes. One of the first messages from the bridge to damage control over the phones confirmed his suspicion. Rocket and cannon shells pounded the <i>Liberty</i> as the planes tag-teamed the defenseless ship. Even in the damage control office below deck, Scott heard the deafening crash of metal on metal as shells ripped holes in the ship's steel skin and echoed through the passageways. Fragments ricocheted off bulkheads inside compartments and littered the decks below.</p><p>Scott's job was to coordinate firefighters, organize stretcher bearers, and assess and respond to damage. He operated this vital function out of an austere office four decks below the bridge. Two phone talkers joined him, using sound-powered phones to relay messages to the bridge and to repair parties strategically stationed around the ship. To help navigate the complex maze of compartments, Scott kept the ship's blueprints spread out under glass on a table in the rear of the room. An inclinometer that measured the <i>Liberty</i>'s tilt in the water hung from the ceiling. If the ship were to flood, the inclinometer would gauge the ship's list and whether it might capsize. Crews of up to fifteen sailors manned three other repair lockers near the bow, stern, and engine room. Each locker held axes, firefighting hoses, and stretchers along with pumps used to dewater compartments.</p><p>Reports arrived of multiple fires on deck. The gasoline drums used to store fuel for the ship's truck and pumps had ignited on the port side, and the fire threatened to spread. Fighters also had hit the motor whaleboat that dangled above the starboard side. The blast set the fiberglass boat ablaze in its davits. Phone talkers also reported that the attackers had hit the bridge. Scott ordered crews from the forward repair locker topside to fight the fires. Men unrolled canvas-covered hoses and turned a valve, releasing a spray of seawater. The effort proved futile. With each pass of the jets, shrapnel punctured the hoses and sapped the pressure. The hoses were worthless, so the firefighters grabbed axes and shovels from the repair locker and tossed flaming debris and rubber over the side.</p><p>The situation worsened. Each time sailors charged onto the deck to rescue the wounded, more were hit by shrapnel. Scott ordered his men to travel through the ship's superstructure, using the safety of the internal passageways. Only go on deck, he instructed, between lulls in the attacks. He also ordered his men to leave the dead and grab only the wounded. A round tore through the bulkhead and hit the valve on a vent pipe directly over Scott's head. He looked up to find that the force had turned the valve upside down. The close hit triggered one of the phone talkers to panic. Scott watched as the man suddenly recited the Lord's Prayer. Scott raced over and grabbed the man by his shirt. He slapped him. "Get it together," Scott ordered. "There's time to pray later, but not now."</p><p>Down in the engine room, Chief Petty Officer Richard Brooks heard the bell ring out over the roar of the machinery. The thirty-one-year-old Yonkers, New York, native shot a glance at the engine order telegraph and saw that the skipper had thrown the lever to all ahead flank, signaling the need for full power. With each pass of the fighters, shrapnel ricocheted inside the cavernous engine room and dropped to the grated deck below. "Get me all the steam pressure," the machinist's mate barked into the voice tube to the boilermen. "I don'twant to wait fifteen minutes. I want it all now."</p><p>The fighters first strafed the <i>Liberty</i> from bow to stern, targeting the bridge, machine guns, and antennae. With those destroyed or on fire, the attackers crisscrossed the spy ship to target the engine room, the <i>Liberty</i>'s heart. Boilers there converted water to steam that raced through metal veins and arteries, driving the two turbines and the screw. Beyond the propulsion system, generators transformed steam pressure to electricity to power everything from the lights and refrigerators to the ship's radios and spy equipment. If the pilots crippled the engine room, Brooks knew the <i>Liberty</i> would be dead in the water, an easy target for fighters or torpedo boats. The <i>Liberty</i> was particularly vulnerable because it was designed as a cargo ship. Warships such as destroyers had two engine rooms and two boiler rooms to increase survivability in an attack.</p><p>Thirteen years in the Navy had taught Brooks that the engine room was one of the most dangerous places on a ship. Pilots knew to aim just beneath a ship's smokestack, but that was only one component of the risk. Superheated steam, often at temperatures as high as 750 degrees, crisscrossed the <i>Liberty</i>'s engine room in asbestos-covered pipes. If shrapnel or a round punctured a major line, Brooks knew scalding steam could flood the room and broil the men alive. That had happened too often during World War II. Another risk centered on the deaerating tank, filled with thousands of gallons of superheated water, suspended high above the engine room. If it ruptured, scalding water would rain down on the sailors. The<i> Liberty</i>'s two boilers also sat like grenades on the engine room floor. If a rocket or torpedo split open the ship's side beneath the waterline, the rush of cold seawater likely would trigger the hot tanks to explode.</p><p>The engine room represented a critical weak spot for the ship. Most of the <i>Liberty</i>'s compartments were restricted to a single deck and guarded by watertight hatches. That allowed damage control crews to seal off flooded compartments in an attack. The engine room's towering boilers and uptakes, about as high as a five-story building, made it impossible to compartmentalize the cavernous space. If a torpedo hit the engine room, seawater could flood the rest of the ship in a matter of minutes, if not seconds. The steel frame of the ship's decks and compartments also served as the ship's skeleton. The absence of that frame around the engine room weakened the <i>Liberty</i>'s hull. If the engine room were to flood, the combination of the added weight of the water and weak structure likely would cause the ship to break in half.</p><p>Golden, the <i>Liberty</i>'s chief engineer, charged in from the wardroom moments after the attack began to find that Brooks had ordered crews to light the No. 2 boiler and increase steam pressure. Though Golden served as the department head, Brooks ran the engine room. Golden even griped that Brooks refused to let him do anything. The machinist mate had an encyclopedic knowledge of the <i>Liberty</i>'s equipment. With his thick New York accent, he often challenged his men to pick any valve and draw a sketch of it. If he couldn't find the valve, Brooks would stand that sailor's watch. Men pored over the boilers, turbines, and pumps to find obscure and hidden valves, but no one had yet stumped Brooks. That knowledge proved essential now as rounds and shrapnel pinballed inside the compartment, busting lights and tearing the insulation from the steam pipes. Smoke from the stack now poured through the skylight above and soot rained down. Through the chaos, Brooks continued to bark at his men.<br></p><p>Petty Officer Eikleberry slipped on his headphones and tuned the receiver's dials in search of the attackers' radio communication. He felt winded from his sprint from the <i>Liberty</i>'s fantail to the research spaces two decks below. Eikleberry had wandered up to the main deck after the general quarters drill for a glimpse of the Egyptian coast, hoping to spot one of the recon flights that had buzzed the ship throughout the morning. He had scanned the golden beaches and seen the dark smoke on the horizon when he heard the first rockets. He had looked up to see a fighter roar down the port side of the <i>Liberty</i> from bow to stern and then bank into the sky. Smoke had billowed up from the ship's bow and bridge. Eikleberry slid down the ladder to the deck below and dashed through a rear-berthing compartment, past the aft repair locker, through the mess deck, and down another ladder to his general quarters station in the bowels of the ship.</p><p>Senior research officers hovered over Eikleberry and other communications technicians as rounds blasted the side of the ship and ricocheted inside the compartment. If Eikleberry or another operator could intercept the pilot's radio communications, the men could identify the attacker's nationality based on whether the pilots spoke Arabic, Hebrew, or Russian. Eikleberry fingered the black dials on his receiver. The young operator, who had joined the Navy two months before his eighteenth birthday, couldn'tbelieve the ship was under...</p></p><h2>Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, Vol. 1</h2><p>This volume contains the translations of works from the Soka Gakkai publication &#34;Nichiren Daishonin gosho zenshu&#34; (&#34;The Complete Works of Nichiren Daishonin&#34;).

[From the Preface]</p><p></p><h2>Resurrection Man</h2><p>In this harrowing, haunting debut novel by one of Ireland's most acclaimed young writers, Eoin McNamee has conjured a dreamlike appraisal of the roots of violence, in a city where reality has long since succumbed to the lure of conspiracy and paranoia.<br>The central character is Victor Kelly, an Irish Protestant with a Catholic last name, a man with an artistic sense of violence and a fondness for John Dillinger movies. He is a killer in Belfast, a city of shadowed streets, abandoned alleyways, and dark, deserted spaces, a city that is as familiar and strange as any other - Los Angeles, Sarajevo, Paris, or Berlin. A city threatened and defined by invisible boundaries, where geography is the key to survival, and every sensory detail assumes the utmost importance.<br>Victor's works of art are found kneeling, hands raised in supplication, the ragged lines of death cut deeply into their bodies. Kelly works under the protection of his own political organization, but as his murders become more terrifying and extreme, and the police investigation intensifies, he finds himself caught in a web of allegiance and betrayal.</p><p>Eoin McNamee is also the author of the collection of novellas, <i>The Last of Deeds </i>&amp; <i>Love in History</i> (Picador). He lives in Ireland <br>The publisher burdens this first novel by a young Irish writer with comparisons to such high stylists as Don DeLillo and Cormac McCarthy. Luckily, McNamee (first name pronounced 'Owen') belongs in such heady company, for, like them, his intense mastery of rhythm and image can sustain the complexity of a world at the level of sentence even as he holds together the larger dynamic of the novel as a whole. Resurrection Man is remarkable for its poetic evocations of violence, human foibles, human suffering. The setting is Belfast in the 1980s; the Resurrection Men are a gang of four led by Victor Kelly, a Protestant drawn into the sectarian violence because his preternaturally silent father is rumored by some to be a secret Catholic, and because he himself is enamored of the gangster movies he used to watch with his mother. Victor is a ruthless killer; his M.O. is the knife across the throat. And it is McNamee's ingenious stroke to link this harsh silencing to blasted Belfast and the broken, inadequate state of words in a place where death and inevitability are etched everywhere in a much more immediate kind of language: he describes the night as a "vernacular darkness"; Victor strips away layers of skin "to arrive at valid words"; a dead man's head is "bent to his chest as though there were something written there he could read." And at nearly every turn, McNamee describes natural events with quirky, sparkling precision that conveys the enormous depth of his engagement with his material and the reach of his imagination: a gang member's mother looks upon him "in a narrow-eyed calculating manner as if he was being measured for some fitted garment of disapproval that she was preparing in another room." That is indeed McCarthy territory, but McNamee lays claim to his own turf in this charging narrative, which keeps the reader on the edge of his seat and is filled with deft overlapping, as one after another Belfast man is "lifted" by Victor and his boys and as Victor becomes a minor celebrity whose arc is finally projected and brought to a close by a mysterious double agent named McClure. The romance here-a woman named Heather is lover to both Victor and a journalist named Ryan covering the case-is sad, real and intelligently underplayed. Victor Kelly is a scarred thug, a mother's son, a creature of enormous complexity and mystery; and though some supporting characters remain slightly overshadowed by the narrative, this book is a chilling masterpiece and a brilliant debut. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Jewelry Concepts and Technology</h2><p>Nearly ten years in preparation and production, &#34;Jewelry Concepts and Technology&#34; is the definitive guide and handbook for jewellery makers on all levels of ability.

Guided by the great blue dragon Tintaglia, they came from the sea: a Tangle of serpents fighting their way up the Rain Wilds River, the first to make the perilous journey to the cocooning grounds in generations. Many have died along the way. With its acid waters and impenetrable forest, it is a hard place for any to survive. People are changed by the Rain Wilds, subtly or otherwise. One such is Thymara. Born with black claws and other aberrations, she should have been exposed at birth. But her father saved her and her mother has never forgiven him. Like everyone else, Thymara is fascinated by the return of dragons: it is as if they symbolise the return of hope to their war-torn world. Leftrin, captain of the liveship Tarman, also has an interest in the hatching; as does Bingtown newlywed, Alise Finbok, who has made it her life&#39;s work to study all there is to know of dragons. But the creatures which emerge from the cocoons are a travesty of the powerful, shining dragons of old. Stunted and deformed, they cannot fly; some seem witless and bestial. Soon, they become a danger and a burden to the Rain Wilders: something must be done. The dragons claim an ancestral memory of a fabled Elderling city far upriver: perhaps there the dragons will find their true home. But Kelsingra appears on no maps and they cannot get there on their own: a band of dragon keepers, hunters and chroniclers must attend them. To be a dragon keeper is a dangerous job: their charges are vicious and unpredictable, and there are many unknown perils on the journey to a city which may not even exist!</p><p><p>Enter the spellbinding world of dragons . . . and those who tend them</p><p>One of the most gifted fantasy authors writing today, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Robin Hobb has dazzled readers with brilliantly imaginative, emotionally resonant, and compulsively readable tales set in far-flung realms not unlike our own. In this enthralling new novel, she returns to the territory of her beloved Liveship Traders and Tawny Man trilogies with a story of dragons and humans, return and rebirth, and the search for meaning, belonging, and home.</p><p>For years, the Trader cities valiantly battled their enemies, the Chalcedeans. But they could not have staved off invasion without the powerful dragon Tintaglia. In return, the Traders promised to help her serpents migrate up the Rain Wild River after a long exile at sea&#x2014;to find a safe haven and, Tintaglia hopes, to restore her species. But too much time has passed, and the newly hatched dragons are damaged and weak, and many die. The few who survive cannot use their wings; earthbound, they are powerless to hunt and vulnerable to human predators willing to kill them for the fabled healing powers of dragon flesh.</p><p>But Tintaglia has vanished and the Traders are weary of the labor and expense of tending useless dragons. The Trader leadership fears that if it stops providing for the young dragons, the hungry and neglected creatures will rampage&#x2014;or die along the river's acidic muddy banks. To avert catastrophe, the dragons decree a move even farther up the treacherous river to Kelsingra, their ancient, mythical homeland whose mysterious location is locked deep within the dragons' uncertain ancestral memories.</p><p>To ensure their safe passage, the Traders recruit a disparate group of young people to care for the damaged creatures and escort them to their new home. Among them is Thymara, an unschooled forest girl of sixteen, and Alise, a wealthy Trader's wife trapped in a loveless marriage, who attaches herself to the expedition as a dragon expert. The two women share a deep kinship with the dragons: Thymara can instinctively communicate with them, and Alise, captivated by their beauty and majesty, has devoted her life to studying them. </p><p>Embarking on an arduous journey that holds no promise of return, the band of humans and dragons must make their way along the toxic and inhospitable Rain Wild River&#x2014;an extraordinary odyssey that will teach them lessons about themselves and one another, as they experience hardships, betrayals, and joys beyond their wildest dreams.</p>Robin Hobb was born in California in 1952 and majored in Communications at Denver University, Colorado.

It&#x2019;s a journey she makes every two weeks, forty miles round trip, traveling between opposite poles of ambition and guilt, school and home. Galla&#x2019;s loving, overwhelmed, incompetent mother doesn&#x2019;t want her to go to school; she wants her to stay at home, where Galla can look after her neglected little sisters, defuse her father&#x2019;s brutal rages, and help with the chores.

Simply put, they do not live according to their convictions. Few can face such truths without feeling the sting of conscience.<br> This book is addressed to Christians, and it is, as its title implies, a serious call to be what they profess. When William Law first wrote A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life in 1728, he set out to show, above all things, that there can be no truth and no wholesome life without perfect sincerity.<br> As you read the words within this cover, you will be caught by the deep note of absolute sincerity that dominates Law�s writing.

More than simply articulating a set of rules to live by, Law&#39;s book examines what it means to lead a Christian life and criticizes the perversion of Christian tenents by the Establishment--whether secular or spiritual--whose real aim is temporal power. With a perface by the Reverend William Sloane Coffin, Jr., whose own direct engagement in social causes still finds inspiration in Law&#39;s argument, A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life is a book that can still speak to our time.</p><h2>Georges Seurat: Drawings</h2><p>Through images and brief text, presents an overview of the life and work of French painter Georges Seurat.</p><p>Paul Flux is a Heinemann Raintree author.</p><h2>Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales (TEAMS Middle English Texts)</h2><p>This volume is the first affordable, modern collection of all eleven of the known Middle English Gawain tales, and aims to make these texts accessible to a wider, contemporary audience. These poems-The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle, Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle, The Avowyng of Arthur, The Awyntrs off Arthur, The Knightly Tale of Gologras and Gawain, The Greene Knight, The Turke and Sir Gawain, The Marriage of Sir Gawain, The Carle of Carlisle, The Jeaste of Sir Gawain, and King Arthur and King Cornwall-are united by their common concern with the theme of chivalry. Sir Gawain was by far the most popular of Arthur&#39;s knights in medieval England, and the verses collected here offer a window not only into English views on Gawain but also attitudes towards the knightly ideal and chivalry.

Roosevelt was a wonderful father, writing to his children, guiding them, playing with them and loving them as do only the best fathers. Long out of print, these personal letters are warm, wonderfully wise and witty--the best things Teddy Roosevelt ever wrote. Photos.</p><p>McCullough's introduction and Kerr's family chronicle set the stage for this wonderful collection of letters-an instant bestseller in 1919-that reveals how seriously yet lightheartedly Theodore Roosevelt took his role as father of six lively children. Written between 1898 and 1911, the letters begin with a letter to the "Blessed Bunnies" as he's about to embark on a military expedition to Cuba and end with a letter complaining about a hat the children "forced" him to buy. In between: letters to the children on such matters as the construction of the Panama Canal, mental telepathy, hunting trips, family pets, Charles Dickens ("an illnatured, selfish cad and boor, who had no understanding of what the word gentleman meant") and one hilarious letter about the president grappling with a Japanese wrestler in the White House. These examples are not exactly typical, however, for each letter is delightfully different, addressed not so much to a child as to a beloved individual regarded as an equal. The volume includes 40 photos of the family at play. Kerr co-edited The Romantic Egoists. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Edited by Kerr (Dictionary of Australian Artists, Sketchers, Photographers, and Engravers, Oxford Univ. Pr., 1993), these family letters of Theodore Roosevelt were a great success when originally published at the time of his death. The first third of the book is Kerr's history of the Roosevelt family, a charming story in which each of the children emerges with a distinct personality. Kerr's style reflects the family's verve and life, but it is also rather twee; the reader will encounter groaners like littlest. As for the letters, Teddy Roosevelt aficionados will enjoy them; the bulk are either descriptions of his travels or counsels to this children when they were away at school. Although this is an attractive package, its audience is probably too limited to make it more than an optional purchase for most libraries.?Fritz Buckallew, Univ. of Central Oklahoma Lib., Edmond<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Triumph TR2/3/4 Owner&#39;s Workshop Manual (Haynes Service and Repair Manuals)</h2><p>All models 2.0 litre (1991cc) &amp; 2.1 litre (2138cc) PLEASE NOTE that this paperback reprint is a digital reproduction of the original manual.</p><p></p><h2>The Squire and the Scroll: A Tale of the Rewards of a Pure Heart [With CD (Audio)]</h2><p>This captivating adventure follows a young squire who travels a long, dangerous road beside his brave knight, on a quest for their king.

The magic-wielding Qirsi and their Eandi masters have mobilized their forces. The Eandi have had to look beyond past differences to make alliances for the sake of the future, praying it isn't too late for them to change the outcome of the war. Tavis, an Eandi prince who was framed for murdering the princess to whom he was pledged, and endured torture before winning his freedom, has at last avenged her death. &nbsp;Still, the murder and its aftermath have brought war to the Forelands just as the Qirsi conspirators who bought his love's blood had intended. &nbsp;Now Tavis and Grinsa, a Qirsi shaper with more powers than he reveals, who saved Tavis when nobody else would believe his innocence, venture across the Forelands, risking death to help save the land they love . . .<br><br>A powerful Qirsi weaver has brought this terrible war to the land, bending the minds of those he controls and of his enemies in an effort to forge alliances and mobilize forces to destroy the Eandi. His powerful magical ability estranges lovers, betrays leaders, and wreaks murder and death throughout the land. But even with his powerfully malign intelligence, he underestimates the mettle of his opponents. In a psychological duel with Grinsa, the Weaver's formidable powers are sorely tested. Grinsa withstands the Weaver's most powerful attacks at nearly the expense of his own life, and in the process discovers the Weaver's identity.<br>Will Grinsa's challenge to the Weaver spell the end of the Weaver's reign of doom?

Was it simply immortality that separated the great ones from those who lived on Elined's earth? Was it their power to bend others to their will, their ability to shape the future and remake the world as they desired? Did he not possess those powers as well? Had he not made himself a god?<br><br>Victory would soon be his, and with his triumph would a come a new world, one that he had foreseen, a world of his own making. Was that not the highest power? He could not cheat death---Bian would call him to his side eventually. But he would be remembered forever: the Weaver who toppled the Eandi courts and ruled the Forelands as its first Qirsi king. Was that not immortality?<br><br>In these last days before war and conquest and the attainment of all for which he had worked and hungered for so long, he found himself remembering a legend told to him by his father when he was no more than a boy, before anyone had thought to call him high chancellor, or Weaver, or king. It was a tale of four brothers, a story his father said had come from the Southlands, with the first Qirsi invaders, nearly nine centuries ago. He had heard it told since by Eandi living in the Forelands, as if the parable and its moral belonged to them. But he knew the truth.<br><br>According to the tale, the four brothers were soldiers who, as they wandered the land, came across a white stag that had been caught in a hunter's snare. The beast was more beautiful than any creature the four men had seen before. It stood taller than the greatest mounts of the southern plains, with a coat the color of cream, and ebony antlers as broad across as an eagle's wings. White stags were said to be enchanted, and they lived under the protection of royal decrees throughout all the kingdoms of the land. Those who dared hunt them not only invited ill fortune by slaying a magical creature, but also risked execution should they be caught.<br><br>Knowing this, the brothers freed the beast, cutting through the snare with their blades. When it was free, the stag bowed to them, and then spoke.<br><br>"You have given me my life, and so I will grant to each of you your heart's desire," the creature said. "You need only sleep tonight in this glade and await the first light of dawn."<br><br>The stag left them then, and the brothers bedded down in the glade.<br><br>In the middle of the night, the oldest of the four awoke to find a warrior standing before him in shining mail, bearing a sword that gleamed in the moonlight. "Come with me," the warrior said, "and I will make you the greatest swordsman in the land. No enemy will dare stand against you, and bards will sing of your prowess in battle."<br><br>Believing that the stag had made good on his promise, the first brother followed the warrior from the glade. Once beyond the last of the trees, however, the warrior vanished as if a spirit and the brother found that the trees would not part to allow him back into the glade.<br><br>Soon after, the second brother awoke to find an old man standing before him in the robes of a king. "Come with me," the man said, "and you shall rule all the land. Nobles will bow to you and swordsmen will follow you to war. All power shall be yours." Like his older brother before him, the second brother thought that this was what the stag had promised. He followed the man from the glade, only to find that the old king had been an apparition and the glade was now closed to him.<br><br>A woman came to the third brother, clad in lace, her silken, black hair falling to the small of her back, and her skin gleaming with starlight. She led him from the glade before dissolving into the night like one of Bian's wraiths.<br><br>The youngest of the four brothers awoke to find a child standing before him. It was a boy, though his hair was long and his face as fine-featured as that of a young girl. In his hands he held glittering gems and gold coins and pearls that seemed to glow from within. "There's more," he said, holding out his hands to the youngest brother. "Follow me and you'll have riches beyond your greatest imaginings."<br><br>"No," said the youngest brother. "The white stag told me I had only to await the dawn. And that is what I shall do."<br><br>The boy begged him to follow, but still the brother refused, and at last the boy left him there.<br><br>When morning came, the stag returned. "You have heeded my words and so earned the rewards you were promised." Then the boy returned, and with him the warrior, the old king, and the woman. The youngest brother became the greatest warrior the land had ever known, the people made him king, and the woman became his queen. Even his brothers knelt before him, knowing that he had succeeded where they failed. And for the rest of his days he enjoyed fame, power, wealth, and deepest happiness.<br><br>Dusaan had taken the lesson of this tale to heart years ago; he had awaited his own destiny with the patience of the youngest brother. And even as the time of his victory approached, even as the first spoils presented themselves to him---be it in the form of gold from the emperor's treasury, or the willing gaze of the underminister who would be his queen---he denied himself the pleasure of taking them as his own. He would in time. Qirsar knew he would. The woman in particular would be a prize to be savored. She had sworn that she would give all to his movement. And he knew that she would give all to him as well. He need only ask. She would bear him children. He had imagined others as his queen; he still did. Harel had several wives, and he was no more than a fat fool, an emperor whose grip on power was more tenuous than he could possibly know. If such a man could claim four women as his own, could not the first Qirsi ruler in the history of the Forelands do the same?<br><br>Soon. So very soon.<br><br>He could see it coming together, like some great quilted blanket spread over the Forelands. Civil war in Aneira, suspicion and murder in Sanbira, a divided kingdom in Eibithar. And in Braedon, an emperor who was so eager for war that he gladly embraced an uncertain ally in the Aneirans and planned as invasion against the Eibitharians that was doomed to fail. The noble courts of the Eandi were destroying themselves. Ean's children were strong of body, but their brawn was nothing next to the magical powers and subtlety of mind of Dusaan's people. The high chancellor had only to wait a bit longer and they would be too weak to stand against him.<br><br>Yes, they had a Weaver on their side as well. Grinsa jal Arriet. But he had weaknesses: a lover and a daughter he could not protect, and allies who so feared any Qirsi Weaver that they would sooner execute the man than allow him to wield his power on their behalf. Dusaan would have to deal cautiously with this other Weaver. He of all people knew better than to take him too lightly. But with care and a bit of good fortune, he might actually be able to use Grinsa to his advantage. There remained a good many Qirsi who had yet to pledge themselves to Dusaan's cause, men and women who would be outraged to learn that a Weaver---a Weaver!---had chosen to protect the Eandi courts rather than side with his own people in their struggle for freedom.<br><br>What kind of man cast his lot with nobles who would execute him and his child merely because of the magic he possessed? What kind of man betrayed his people even though he possessed power enough to lead them to victory? In choosing to fight with the Eandi, Grinsa made himself a traitor to all Qirsi, a modern-day Carthach to be vilified, to be used as a tool that would unite all people of the sorcerer race. Dusaan seemed a champion by comparison, a contrast that would serve him well when the time came.<br><br>So very soon. All he needed was to wait a short time longer, with the patience of the youngest brother.<br><br>Copyright � 2007 by David B.

If one has lived nothing, one is not in the Book of Life. <br> I have always wanted to write about everything. That does not mean to write a book that covers everything--which would be impossible, but a book in which everything can go. A book with a little of everything that creates itself out of nothing. That has its own life. A faithful book. I no longer look at it as a "book." -- Thomas Merton, July 17, 1956</blockquote><p></p><p> In this diary-like memoir, composed of his most poignant and insightful journal entries, <em>The Intimate Merton</em> lays bare the steep ways of Thomas Merton's spiritual path. Culled from the seven volumes of his personal journals, this twenty-nine year chronicle deepens and extends the story Merton recounted and made famous in <em>The Seven Storey Mountain.</em> This book is the spiritual autobiography of our century's most celebrated monk--the wisdom gained from the personal experience of an enduring spiritual teacher. Here is Merton's account of his life's major challenges, his confrontations with monastic and church hierarchies, his interaction with religious traditions east and west, and his antiwar and civil-rights activities. In <em> The Intimate Merton</em> we engage a writer's art of "confession and witness" as he searches for a contemporary, authentic, and global spirituality.</p><p> Recounting Merton's earliest days in the monastery to his journey east to meet the Dalai Lama, <em>The Intimate Merton</em> reveals a life lived in continuous pursuit of meaning, equanimity, and love. <em>The Intimate Merton</em> captures the essence of what makes his life journey so perennially relevant.</p> <p></p><blockquote> "My best writing has always been in journals." -- Thomas Merton </blockquote><p></p></p><p>If you like your saints packaged without the messiness of an actual error-filled life, this book is not for you. If, however, you want a glimpse inside the mind and spirit of a splendid writer and thinker who tried live his life as honestly as he could as a journey into God, then this is a grace-filled beauty. Subtitled "His Life from His Journals," these selections--dating from 1939 (before he entered the monastery) to 1968 (within days of his death)--remind us how much of Merton's life unfolded precisely in and through his own writing--how he made himself through his writing. As he says, "it seems to me that writing, far from being an obstacle to spiritual perfection in my own life, has become one of the conditions on which my perfection will depend." Merton contends that writing--honest writing--is his way to move more and more deeply into the truth. In these very honest pages, covering everything from his meeting with the Dalai Lama to his experience of falling in love (25 years after entering the monastery), Truth unfolds itself through the act of writing. These pages are a thread into the center of that labyrinth, which is where he meets his God. Now we're invited along for the ride. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i><p>Thomas Merton (1915-1968) is widely regarded as one of the most influential spiritual writers of modern times.

Larry Pardey is accepted as one of the master craftsman of the wooden-boat building world. He and his wife, Lin, have built two, strong, handsome boats an sailed twice around the world in them. This book will help you to save money, time, and energy while creating the boat of your dreams. This book will also guide you with the right tools and equipment, planning and detailing as well as how to create and make your own tools. Guides to repairing and maintaining your boat are included as well. A world of useful information is contained in just these 500 pages.</p><p>Larry Pardey spent his teenage years rebuilding several boats ranging from eight to twenty feet in length. As he sold each one, he used his "sweat equity" profits to finance his next project. His largest from-the-keel-up projects have been the two boats he built with his wife Lin: <i>Seraffyn</i> the five-ton cutter which took them on an eleven-year, east-about circumnavigation, and <i>Taleisin</i> the boat shown in this book, which took them west-about over the past 30 years. As they cruised, Larry put his skills to work earning the majority of his income by repairing and restoring classic boats in fifteen different countries, including two that he and Lin then raced successfully in New Zealand. Many of the ideas he shares in this book where learned from builders he met in the course of his travels.<p>As Peter Milne, editor of <i>Classic Boat </i> magazine commented, "Larry's prime interest might be the building of wooden craft, but he is one of those rare creatures, a builder who has covered a tremendous number of sea miles - more than 200,000- in yachts of his own building as well as other people's. This has given Larry firsthand information about which boat-building techniques work, which don't, out there in the big test-tank, the ocean. With his well-rounded background, larry has developed a reputation as one of the master craftsmen of the wooden boatbuilding world."</p><p>For over 45 years, Lin has worked alongside Larry, doing his purchasing and finish work. She has written extensively about their voyages and worked as researcher and editor on this book.</p><p>Together Lin and Larry have written ten other books and produced five videos on various sailing subjects. They are currently residing at their homebase in New Zealand where they have a small boat repair facility.</p>Building a wooden boat is a deeply satisfying creative pursuit and one of the pinnacles of that near-relative of art craftsmanship. Larry Pardey dismisses the common moan that the traditional skills of this particular craftsmanship are lost. Nor, he shows, is there anything mysterious about them; they can be easily learned. Perhaps the most valuable quality of the book is the way it passes on vital know-how about details of construction methods and the relative importance of particular items and aspects. -- <i>Lloyds List, London</i><br><br>Details, he says, and by golly, details it is. Such a great work cannot be summarized in a couple of paragraphs. No detail is omitted, and every picture has clearly worded supportive text. One can do little more than say this is a truly comprehensive handbook for anyone who aims to build a carvel hull. -- <i>Denny Desoutter, editor emeritus, Practical Boat Owner</i><br><br>For me this has to be the book on traditional wooden-yacht construction to be published in over five decades. In some 518 salty and sawdust-laden pages there are lessons and new tricks for even the most horny-handed, time-served, and experienced exponent of this wonderful trade of ours. For the amateur interested in the more traditional side of things, this book will, I am sure, become their bible, and rightfully so. It is difficult to single out any one area of the book over the other, but I think that it would be worth buying for the appendices alone. -- <i>Bob Forsyth</i><br><br>For someone, especially an amateur, about to start the lengthy and daunting process of building a wooden boat, it would be an invaluable and comforting guide. Pardey is perfectly upfront about the aims of the book: I have tried to concentrate on giving details of construction and information about skills that are not found in books available on boatbuilding. He has succeeded rather well, for the book does indeed go into considerable detail on the methods and tricks employed by an experienced builder to build a sailboat hull from scratch. -- <i>Joel White, boatbuilder/designer, Woodenboat</i><br><br>This book will help sailors work with wood as well as educate them regarding the way classic wooden boats come together. It is a great collection of speed tricks. -- <i>Sail Magazine</i><br><br>This comprehensive guide to classic boat construction contains a wealth of photographs and step-by-step guides to various aspects of boatbuilding, from lofting floors and framing to a selection of materials, design considerations, and the myriad details that make up a wooden yacht. -- <i>Paul Gelder, Ed., Yachting Monthly</i><br><br>This is a comprehensive, well-illustrated, and thoroughly readable manual. In a clear, simple, and almost chatty text supplemented with well-selected photographs and simple sketches, the author has imparted a wealth of his expertise. Any amateur or professional, for that matter would do well to read this book from cover to cover more than once before he/she hefted an adze or rammed a pencil behind an ear. -- <i>Peter Milne, editor, Classic Boat</i><br><br>Which of us hasnt been enamored of the beauty of wooden boats and the romance of building one. Now comes a book that outlines the reality. Even those wishing to do only a bit of touch-up work on their boats should have this in their library. --<i>Charles Barthold, Yachting</i><br><br>This impressive book shows the process of constructing a boat hull with extensive photographs and drawings and includes ample time-saving procedures.

He was the author of more than forty works, including <em>The Apostolic Preaching of the Cross, The Atonement,</em> and comprehensive scholarly studies on Matthew, Luke, John and Romans. He was the general editor of the Tyndale New Testament Commentaries and wrote the volumes in that series on Luke, 1 Corinthians, 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians and Revelation."The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible."

Beginning in March, when the gardening year gets underway, Reich is off and running, from weeds to ripening fruits, laying down his trowel and picking up his pruning shears, or just planning: the spring garden, the fall garden, perhaps a path. The progress of the seasons and the whims and vagaries of the weather and the plants dictate the topics that he writes about within each month, Horticultural engravings from the Victorian period round out the mood.A garden journal brimming with wonderful observations and practical tips on when, how, and what to plant throughout the year, <i>A Northeast Gardener's Year</i> moves from the unfolding of blossoms to the cry of a plant begging to be repotted as its roots push through the bottom of its container; from enjoying foxy grapes, to planting by the moon, to growing the eerie and putrid voodoo lily given by a mischievous neighbor. Reich writes of wild tulips, pea planting, cold frames, new trees, strawberries, columbines, lawns, plant pests, daisies, lilies, onions, tomato troubles, summer bulbs, rose hips, pressed flowers, choice apples, birdhouse gourds, record keeping, garden clean-up, winter ornaments, siting houseplants, purple broccoli, wood ashes, garden structure, and much, much more through the seasons.While this book is about a garden in the northeast, gardeners throughout the country will find common ground merely by adding or subtracting a few days on either side of the outdoor growing season. <i>A Northeast Gardener's Year</i> is a literary treasure chock-full of practical tips that will delight both the armchair gardener and the dirt-under-the-fingernails gardener. It places Lee Reich in the first rank of garden writers today.</p><p><b>Lee Reich</b> is a professional horticulturalist and garden writer with a Ph.D. in horticulture. He contributes frequently to The New York Times gardening pages, Horticulture, and Organic Gardening, among other publications, and is the author of Uncommon Fruits Worthy of Attention (Addison-Wesley, 1991). He lives in New Paltz, New York, but has gardened as far west as Wisconsin and as far south as Delaware.With the authority of an experienced gardener and writer, Reich shares a gardening year in New Paltz, New York. His diary of garden observations and work with vegetables and flowers focuses on plant care that is common in the Northeast, Midwest, and other areas in that plant range. Reich has a fine sense of the level of gardening activity that successful growers need to maintain throughout the year. There is not a lot of detailed cultural information here; his chatty style of writing makes the book most suitable for public library browsing collections.

Told here for the first time in his own words is the story of the man who would come to be known as Bill W.�a man who, for his part in founding the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, would be celebrated as one of the important figures of the twentieth century. </p><p>�The terrifying darkness had become complete. In agony of spirit, I again thought of the cancer of alcoholism which had now consumed me in mind and spirit, and soon the body. But what of the Great Physician? For a brief moment, I suppose, the last trace of my obstinacy was crushed out as the abyss yawned. </p><p>�I remember saying to myself, �I�ll do anything, anything at all. If there be a Great Physician, I�ll call on him.� Then, with neither faith nor hope I cried out, �If there be a God, let him show himself.��</p></p><p>William Griffith Wilson (Bill W.) was born in 1895 and died in 1971. In Akron Ohio, in 1935, along with Dr. Bob, he founded what later would come to be known as Alcoholics Anonymous, and he subsequently devoted his life to its mission.As a founder and world-famous proponent of Alcoholics Anonymous, Bill W. told his story many times-but only in part, always with an eye to helping others out of the depths he could describe so well. Finally, though, near the age of sixty, knowing that his biography would surely be written and that there would be considerable interest in the circumstances behind his achievements, Bill W. began in tape recordings and notes, to &#34;set the record somewhere near straight.&#34; The result is this book, a thoroughly engaging account of Bill W.&#39;s life from childhood through manhood, rendered with the immediacy, directness, and characteristic charm of his speech."[I]n a hotel then known as Wilson House I was born, perhaps rightly, in a room just back of the old bar," writes Wilson (1895-1970), cofounder and organizer of Alcoholics Anonymous, in this first published edition of an autobiography he began in 1954. Telling one's story is an important AA tradition. Bill W., as Wilson was known in AA circles, had a reputation for being a good storyteller and had previously recounted much of his life in the Big Book (also titled Alcoholics Anonymous) and other writings. Here, Wilson tells of his childhood, military service, marriage, attempts to stop drinking, and spiritual conversion in 1934 but stops short of his historic meeting with cofounder Dr. Bob. The publisher has added articles, appendixes, and recollections of friends, family, and colleagues to flesh out Wilson's fragmented account. In contrast to Francis Hartigan's recent conventional but comprehensive biography, Bill W. (LJ 2/1/00), Bill W. and Mr. Wilson offers an outsider's "personal impressions and ruminations." Following Wilson's own three-part formula ("what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now"), Raphael, an AA member writing under a pseudonym, observes that "what [Bill W.] used to be like scarcely exists outside...the account he first gave in Alcoholics Anonymous and then repeated often." Raphael seeks to distinguish Bill W., cofounder of AA and the Twelve Steps, from Bill Wilson, who "closely guarded his private life during his public career, even as he seemed to bare his soul at AA meetings." Throughout his life, Wilson battled depression, smoked heavily, and had a reputation as a womanizer. Later in life, he participated in LSD research and promoted alternative therapies for alcoholism. As Raphael describes Wilson's life, he traces parallels in the evolution of AA from its origins in the Oxford Group, a religious lay movement, to a worldwide self-help organization of alcoholics helping alcoholics. Both books, while important contributions to the growing literature on Bill W., are supplementary purchases for collections on drug and alcohol abuse.

Yet this is the first book to tell the story of rain.<br><br> Cynthia Barnett's&nbsp;<i>Rain&nbsp;</i>begins four billion years ago with the torrents that filled the oceans, and builds to the storms of climate change.

Two centuries later, rainy skies would help inspire Morrissey&#x2019;s mopes and Kurt Cobain&#x2019;s grunge.&nbsp;<i>Rain&nbsp;</i>is also a travelogue, taking readers to Scotland to tell the surprising story of the mackintosh raincoat, and to India, where villagers extract the scent of rain from the monsoon-drenched earth and turn it into perfume.<br><br> Now, after thousands of years spent praying for rain or worshiping it; burning witches at the stake to stop rain or sacrificing small children to bring it; mocking rain with irrigated agriculture and cities built in floodplains; even trying to blast rain out of the sky with mortars meant for war, humanity has finally managed to change the rain. Only not in ways we intended. As climate change upends rainfall patterns and unleashes increasingly severe storms and drought, Barnett shows rain to be a unifying force in a fractured world. Too much and not nearly enough, rain is a conversation we share, and this is a book for everyone who has ever experienced it.</p><p>Cynthia Barnett&nbsp;is an award-winning environmental journalist who has reported on water from the Suwannee River to Singapore.

We learn about the origin of rain jackets, the aroma of rain, how Daniel Defoe helped popularize umbrellas, why it occasionally rains frogs, whether rain actually did follow the plow, and why we need to worry about climate change...One of her most fascinating sections is on the language of rain.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2014;</i><b><b><i>SEATTLE TIMES</i></b></b><br><br>&#x201c;Barnett weaves together a compelling set of human tales that carry [her readers] through millennia and around the world, often in vivid and lyrical prose that is leavened with humor.&#x201d;<br><b><i>&#x2014;DALLAS MORNING NEWS</i></b><br><br>"Maybe because it&#x2019;s as refreshing as its title, or maybe because it reminded me of spring, but <i>Rain: A Natural and Cultural History</i> made me very happy.

They had been engaged, but she had broken it off when Pongo refused to smuggle jewellery into America for a friend of hers.</p><p>P.G. Wodehouse was born in 1881. He is the creator of Jeeves, Blandings Castle, Psmith, Ukridge, Uncle Fred and Mr Mulliner stories and novels.We might save everyone trouble by not bothering to review Wodehouse audiobooks. Instead, we could simply announce, "Here's a new one. Come and get it!" However, as excellent as the recordings usually are, not every Wodehouse text is wonderful, so we must carry on. Happily, Uncle Dynamite is another winner. First published in 1948, it is one of the few books about Uncle Fred (a.k.a. Lord Ickenham) and the usual complicated Wodehouse story line: A loves B but is engaged to C, whom D secretly loves, and so on. Of course, with Uncle Fred spreading sweetness and light, generous helpings of happy endings can be counted on. What sets this book apart is its outstanding dialog, which gives reader Jonathan Cecil broad scope to spread his wonderful gift for voices. A real treat for those who appreciate exquisite language; highly recommended.<br><i>-R.

Torme has also been an aviator, motorcyclist, novelist, biographer, collector of rare Colt guns and father of five children and two stepchildren born to four wives. In this fluent, intimate memoir he reviews his near-legendary onstage life, recalls his associations with Sammy Davis Jr., Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Judy Garland, Benny Goodman, Jerry Lewis, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra, describes his dates with Ava Gardner and Marilyn Monroe, and agonizes over custody fights with his former wives. Torme ends with reflections and afterthoughts about his children, friends and favorite people. His tone is somewhat self-pitying, but lively and candid.

The fact that Carol was about to become a mother shouldn&#x2019;t have come as a shock&#x2014;her sister and Jason had been married for two years, after all. Lauren loved her sister, and Jason would make a wonderful father. What bothered her was the fact that at age thirty-four, Lauren was still unmarried.<br><br>Single. Oh, how she&#x2019;d come to hate that word.<br><br>Walking down Blossom Street, Lauren buried her hands deep into the pockets of her fawn-colored rain jacket. Tulips and crocuses bloomed in the flowerpots that hung from the streetlights, and the scent of roses, lilacs, and camellias followed her as she walked past Susannah&#x2019;s Garden, the flower shop.<br><br>Lauren kept her head down as she mulled over this latest development. This was it. The end of her rope. The line in the sand. She was finished waiting for Todd to give her an engagement ring. A year earlier she&#x2019;d had the DTR&#x2014;Defining the Relationship&#x2014;talk with Todd and he&#x2019;d assured her that marriage was definitely part of their future. Only he wasn&#x2019;t in a financial position to make the leap just yet. He&#x2019;d suggested they give it time, and she&#x2019;d reluctantly agreed. That was twelve months ago, and frankly her patience was shot. She&#x2019;d dated the popular local television newscaster for three years and it was time to own up to the truth. If Todd was sincere about wanting her for his wife, then she would have had a diamond on her ring finger long before now.<br><br>Clearly Todd enjoyed their relationship just the way it was, and in some ways so did she. Todd was fun and smart, and she liked being with him. Because of his job, Lauren frequently accompanied him to high-profile social events. As a result, she was able to mingle with some of the city&#x2019;s elite, and it didn&#x2019;t hurt that many of these socialites came to John Michael Jewelers, where she worked, for their jewelry needs.<br><br>Lauren passed A Good Yarn and the window display instantly caught her attention. She stopped to give it a look and shook her head. Wouldn&#x2019;t you know it, the display in the yarn store&#x2019;s window was a baby blanket.<br><br>A beautiful baby blanket knit in lovely pastel colors. Lauren wanted to groan. She loved her sister, but there&#x2019;d always been a friendly rivalry between them. More laid-back of the two, Lauren didn&#x2019;t have big career ambitions, whereas Carol worked as a program designer for a large software company out of California. She&#x2019;d married her college sweetheart and seemed to have the perfect life.<br><br>Lauren had dropped out of college after a couple of years and over time had worked at a number of jobs. She enjoyed sales and seemed to be good at it. The irony was that her specialty was engagement and wedding bands. The couples she dealt with were deeply in love and eager to start their lives together. It gave Lauren a deep sense of satisfaction to help them take one of their first steps toward commitment.<br><br>The bottom line, she realized now, was that Todd was completely content to leave matters just as they were. They got along great and talked frequently. Rarely a week passed without them attending some sort of social event. They would like to spend more time together, but Todd was busy with his broadcasting career. He had his sights set on getting an anchor position and focused most of his attention on achieving his professional goals.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Lauren,&#x201d; Lydia Hoffman said, coming up from behind her.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, hi.&#x201d; Lauren spun around to greet the owner of the yarn store. Lydia&#x2019;s husband, Brad, had purchased his wife&#x2019;s wedding band at John Michael Jewelers, where Lauren had worked for the past five years.<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that a beautiful baby blanket?&#x201d; Lydia asked, apparently noticing that Lauren&#x2019;s gaze was focused on the window display.<br><br>&#x201c;It is.&#x201d; Lauren had no option but to agree.<br><br>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ve sold more yarn from this display than any I&#x2019;ve ever done. There&#x2019;s something about knitting for babies that draws people into the shop. Just yesterday a customer stopped by and bought yarn for the blanket and told me she doesn&#x2019;t know anyone who&#x2019;s having a baby, but she thought she&#x2019;d knit it anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>Lauren faked a smile. &#x201c;I just got word my sister is pregnant.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t elaborate and explain that Carol was a full two years younger than she. &#x201c;When I saw this blanket I thought I should knit it for her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;d treasure it. Anything homemade makes a baby gift all the more special.&#x201d;<br><br>Lydia inserted the key to the front door, and while Lauren was tempted to purchase the yarn right then, she needed to get to work herself. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be by later today or tomorrow to pick up the yarn.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Make it Thursday. I&#x2019;m sold out, but I have a new shipment due in then. I&#x2019;ll be here if you need any help with the pattern,&#x201d; Lydia assured her.<br><br>John Michael Jewelers was one block down from the yarn store. Elisa Lippincott, the original owner&#x2019;s daughter, managed the store now with her husband, Garry. Lauren enjoyed her job immensely and considered Elisa a friend as well as her employer.<br><br>&#x201c;Morning,&#x201d; Lauren said as she came into the store. She locked the door behind her. When the safe was open all the doors leading into the store remained locked.<br><br>Elisa stuck her head out of the walk-in safe. &#x201c;Morning,&#x201d; she returned brightly. She had a pair of jewel cases in her hands, which she set into the display window that looked out onto Blossom Street.<br><br>Lauren removed her raincoat and stuck it in the back office along with her purse. Right away she helped Elisa get out the precious stones. Despite the down economy, the store continued to do well. Elisa, Garry, and Lauren&#x2014;all working full-time, along with a few part-time sales associates&#x2014;were a good team.<br><br>&#x201c;Garry will be in sometime this afternoon,&#x201d; Elisa explained as she set out the semiprecious stones. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got a meeting at the school for one of the boys, and then he&#x2019;s headed to lunch with the Rotary Club.&#x201d;<br><br>Garry was the company expert when it came to men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s watches. Lauren headed up their diamond sales, and Elisa handled just about everything else.<br><br>&#x201c;I heard from my sister,&#x201d; Lauren said casually as she set the jewels in the display case, locking them inside. &#x201c;Carol and Jason are pregnant.&#x201d; She made sure she sounded pleased and excited for her younger sibling.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; Lauren agreed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just wonderful. Mom and Dad are over the moon. Their first grandchild.&#x201d;<br><br>Elisa paused and focused her attention on Lauren. &#x201c;You sound like you&#x2019;re ready to cry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I could break into sobs at the drop of a pin,&#x201d; she admitted, and tried to laugh it off, but the only sound that came out was reminiscent of something one might hear on the Sci-Fi channel. She quickly got hold of herself. &#x201c;Tell me, Elisa, and please be honest. Is there something wrong with me?&#x201d; Because Elisa was her friend, she expected the truth.<br><br>&#x201c;Wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Am I annoying?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d; Elisa sounded shocked that Lauren would suggest such a thing.<br><br>&#x201c;Do I have a domineering or unpleasant personality?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do I bore you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Her friend shook her head.<br><br>&#x201c;Am I unattractive?&#x201d;<br><br>This question produced a laugh. &#x201c;Hardly. Have you looked in a mirror lately? You&#x2019;re gorgeous&#x2014;tall and slim, with your stunning blue eyes and that dark hair. I swear there must be some Scottish blood in you somewhere. Half the men who come in this shop leave half in love with you.&#x201d;<br><br>Her friend&#x2019;s words were a balm to her wounded pride. &#x201c;Then why am I still single?&#x201d;<br><br>Elisa didn&#x2019;t hesitate. &#x201c;Because Todd Hampton is an idiot.&#x201d; She gently squeezed Lauren&#x2019;s forearm. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been much too patient with him. You need to give Todd an ultimatum,&#x201d; she suggested. &#x201c;He loves you. All he needs now is a gentle shove in the right direction. Tell him it&#x2019;s time; you&#x2019;ve been patient to this point, but you aren&#x2019;t willing to continue without a firm commitment.&#x201d;<br><br>An ultimatum for Todd&#x2014;Lauren had reached the same conclusion but then rethought the matter. The fact was, she&#x2019;d spent the majority of the night tossing and turning, mulling over her options with Todd. She&#x2019;d teetered back and forth with the relationship, wondering what would be best. She hated the idea of forcing him to set a date, and then wondered why she&#x2019;d been so willing to let matters drag.<br><br>&#x201c;The thing is . . .&#x201d; Lauren didn&#x2019;t get the opportunity to finish her sentence when Elisa&#x2019;s cellphone chirped.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Katie.&#x201d; Elisa grabbed it before the second chirp.<br><br>Lauren knew the shop owner had been anxiously awaiting a call from her oldest child. Katie was a college freshman, and Elisa had undergone separation anxiety sending her only daughter away to school, which was less than three hundred miles away in Pullman, Washington. Elisa worried incessantly over Katie&#x2019;s diet, studies, partying, alcohol, and dating. If Katie didn&#x2019;t contact her mother at some point during the day, Elisa was convinced her child had fallen victim to any number of dreadful possibilities.<br><br>&#x201c;Katie, why haven&#x2019;t you called?&#x201d; Elisa demanded. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t answer the text message I sent, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Elisa paused, then let out a loud gasp and hurried into the small office, quickly closing the door. Lauren couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder what that was about. Her friend tended to be something of a drama queen. Even with the office door closed, Lauren could hear Elisa, although she couldn&#x2019;t make out what she was saying.<br><br>The possibilities raced through Lauren&#x2019;s mind. More than likely, it was something minor. Katie might have flunked an important test. More likely, she needed extra money put into her bank account. Quite possibly, she hadn&#x2019;t turned in her library books on time and had allowed the fine to accumulate. Lauren liked Katie and considered the teenager levelheaded and responsible. As a friend and employer, Elisa was great, but as a mother, she was a bit fixated.<br><br>Ten minutes later, Elisa reappeared, as white as a sun-bleached sheet.<br><br>&#x201c;Elisa,&#x201d; Lauren asked tentatively. &#x201c;Is everything all right with Katie?&#x201d;<br><br>Her friend didn&#x2019;t answer and then simply shook her head.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you need to sit down?&#x201d;<br><br>Elisa nodded.<br><br>Lauren scooted over a stool, and Elisa sank onto it in slow motion.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you want me to call Garry?&#x201d;<br><br>That got an immediate response that came as a shout: &#x201c;No . . . no!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can I get you coffee?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I need something way stronger than coffee. Way stronger.&#x201d;<br><br>Lauren didn&#x2019;t think they kept anything more potent at the store, unless it was for a special sales event. Even then it was champagne, and Lauren suspected Elisa wasn&#x2019;t in the mood to celebrate with a glass of bubbly. &#x201c;Can you tell me what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I . . . I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Tears welled in Elisa&#x2019;s eyes.<br><br>Apparently, this was something far worse than an overdue library book or a failed test. Disregarding what Elisa had claimed she needed, Lauren brewed her a single cup of coffee, making sure it was extra-strong. She added three cubes of sugar and stirred until it had dissolved before delivering it to her friend.<br><br>Elisa held on to the cup with both hands as though it was all that was keeping her from falling off the edge of a ten-story building. &#x201c;Do you remember Dietrich?&#x201d;</p><h2>True Names...and Other Dangers</h2><p>Collects five science fiction short stories about adventures in the strange world of the future</p><p></p><h2>Guns of the American West</h2><p><p>Dennis Adler, award-winning author and photographer, and contributing editor to <i>Guns of the Old West</i> magazine, has woven together enthralling tales of the guns and gunmen who made the Wild West wild.

Thomas Merton's affection for these "Desert Fathers" shines in this much-loved treasury of their acts and words of wisdom.

Reprint.</p><p>Anne Lamott is the author of four other novels: <i>Hard Laughter</i>, <i>Rosie</i>, <i>Joe Jones</i>, and the recent <i>Crooked Little Heart</i>. Her non-fiction includes <i>Operating Instructions: A Journal of My Son's First Year</i>, <i>Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life</i>, and the best-selling <i>Traveling Mercies</i>. She lives in Northern California with her son, Sam.Confirming the talent evinced in Rosie (and somewhat obscured by the excessively arch tone of her last novel, Joe Jones ), Lamott here achieves her promising potential in a novel of rare sensitivity and evocative power. The rueful, elegiac tone of her prose balanced by humor and plangent insights, she tells a quiet but resonant story through the eyes of Nan Goodman, who has returned to the small northern California town of her childhood. This is a meticulously observed memoir of growing up as the child of ultra - liberal (former "commie") parents: her volatile father is a noted but not financially successful writer; her mother, a devout Christian who rails at God and seeks to reform the world through social activism. The extended family includes Nan's brother Casey, their feckless, alcoholic uncle Ed and obese aunt Peg, and Nan's mother's eccentric divorced friend, Natalie. There is little overt action here--Natalie gets pregnant by Ed, Casey smokes pot, their father leaves and comes back--but these events are magnified against the social and cultural currents of the '60s and '70s: developers change the character of the town, there is an epidemic of divorces, the drug culture takes its toll. The rural setting is integral to Nan's memories: the smell and sight of the sea, wildflowers on the brown hillsides, plum and apple and fig trees, pink and purple fog. Nan remembers it all with a clear-eyed nostalgia, acknowledging the migraines that made her an outsider, and the fear, shame and humiliation lurking even in the fondest memories of happy times. The emotional complexity of this understated tale makes it an absorbing read. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Planes (Look Inside Cross-Sections)</h2><p>An young aviator&#39;s addition to an exciting and informative series integrates lively text with full-color illustrations to draw the reader into the myriad of flying machines with a technical spread that details each part and its function.</p><p>Grade 3 Up-Two books that let young readers explore the inside of planes and ships by means of colorful cross-sections. Ten ships are presented, each in a two-page spread (except for the USS Lexington, which gets four) that contains on average six sentences of facts and a box entitled "Technical Data," which lists length, beam, and other details. Children will probably be more interested in the clear, detailed, well-labeled drawings. They are not strictly cross-sections, however; some ships are sliced laterally. The goal is to let readers see inside them. The presentation begins with a trireme and concludes with a British Royal National lifeboat. Planes follows the same format. A Fokker Triplane and the world's first airliner, the graceful Handley Page, are included along with the Boeing 314 seaplane, a Spitfire, the famed Flying Fortress (B17), and five more appealing aircraft. While the drawings are interesting and clear in both titles, they are not of the caliber of Stephen Biesty's books (Dorling Kindersley).<br><i>Don Reaber, Meadowdale High School, Lynnwood, WA</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Stretch &amp; Sew Guide to Sewing on Knits (Creative Machine Arts Series)</h2><p>Demonstrates special techniques for sewing with knit fabrics, includes a variety of basic patterns, and shows how to make shirts, cardigans, pants, skirts, swimwear, and activewear</p><p></p><h2>Cockatiels at Seven (Meg Langslow Mysteries)</h2><p><p>When her old friend Karen drops by with her two-year-old son, Meg Langslow reluctantly agrees to mind him for a few hours.

This undoubtedly beautiful package--cloth-bound in a classy red and adorned by numerous illustrations by master engraver and illustrator John Lawrence--is a must-purchase. A pint-sized pocket volume, <i>Lyra's Oxford</i> packages together a short story set in the same universe as his famous trilogy, a fold-out map of the alternate-reality city of Oxford, a short brochure for a cruise to The Levant aboard the S.S.

Pullman, in his introduction, suggests that the peripheral items within "might be connected with the story, or they might not; they might be connected to stories that haven&#x2019;t appeared yet. It's difficult to tell." <p> A very sumptuous and lovingly crafted but tantalizingly brief book , <i>Lyra's Oxford</i> begins when Lyra and Pantalaimon spot a witch's daemon called Ragi being pursued over the rooftops of Oxford by a frenzied pack of birds. The daemon heads straight for Lyra (the creature was given Lyra&#x2019;s name as somebody who might help) and is given shelter. Together Lyra and Pan try to guide the daemon to the home of Sebastian Makepeace&#x2014;an alchemist living in a part of Oxford known as Jericho--but it is a journey fraught with more danger than they had at first anticipated.

In <i>Though None Go with Me</i>, Jenkins introduces Elisabeth Grace LeRoy, a woman whose faith is tested time and again. He opens with 45-year-old Grace answering her phone at midnight, only to be told that her son is still alive but trapped inside a wrecked car. Like many Christians, she finds herself questioning God. "She had thought she understood grace, had told herself she understood sovereignty. But unless He spared her son ... she feared there was something about God she still didn't understand--and didn't like."<p> As is typical of Jenkins, <i>Though None Go with Me</i> is a smooth narrative--unencumbered by extensive character development or numerous subplots--in short, a family saga that could easily be a one-night page-turner. Readers will certainly find themselves invested in this spiritually complex and highly likable heroine who somehow keeps her trust in God through the ultimate human struggles, including a shattered romance and the near death of her son.</p>Best-selling author Jerry Jenkins presents the work of his heart, a story he has wanted to tell for years. In this premier book in his new Three Rivers Legacy series, Jenkins applies the masterful storytelling skills that have made Left Behind and Tribulation Force fixtures on the best-seller lists. Though None Go with Me introduces Elisabeth Grace LeRoy, the kind of heroine who not only causes fiction fans to burn the midnight oil, but inspires them to a deeper faith and a strengthening of their commitments to God and those they love. Born at the dawn of the 1900s, Hannah grows up with the century. As a girl, she is enthralled with the faith of her fathers, taking great delight in the Sunday school Bible stories and church hymns. But Elisabeth&#39;s faith is deeply accessible. From the first page she is as human and conflicted as any of fiction&#39;s best-loved heroines. What sets her apart is her commitment as a young teen to make the rest of her life an experiment in obedience. That heartfelt decision is tested incessantly in Elisabeth&#39;s tumultuous life. A shattered romance haunts her forever. Those she loves most cause her immense pain, and she loses someone especially precious. Through the fires of life, Hannah digs her heels in, refusing to compromise her early pledge. But at what cost? She wonders if there is any real benefit in serving God unswervingly. From this unforgettable woman&#39;s story, readers learn the true riches of faithfulness to God, despite lack of obvious rewards. Those who love sweeping family sagas will cherish this very personal story of one woman who lives out her faith regardless of circumstances.</p><h2>Everything Is Going to Be OK</h2><p>A little inspiration goes a long way.

Now with this impassioned and incisive book, our foremost Palestinian-American intellectual challenges the official version of the Middle East &#34;peace process.&#34; &#34;He challenges and stimulates our thinking in every area.&#34;-- Washington Post Book World.</p><p>Ever since Yasir Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn, Israel and the Palestinian people have been engaged in what commentators persist in calling &#34;the peace process&#34;. Yet Israel remains racked by violence and continuing land seizures, and Palestinians are more demoralized than ever before. Now in this probing and impassioned book, one of our foremost Palestinian-American intellectuals explains why the much-vaunted process has yet to produce peace - and is unlikely to as presently constituted. Whether Edward Said is addressing the fatal flaws in the PLO&#39;s bargain, denouncing fundamentalists on both sides of the religious divide, or calling our attention to the distortions in official coverage of the Arab world, he offers insights beyond the conventional wisdom and a sympathy that extends to both Israelis and Palestinians. He does so with an incisiveness, clarity, and fairness that make Peace and Its Discontents essential reading for anyone who cares about the future of the Middle East.Edward W. Said was born in 1935 in Jerusalem, raised in Jerusalem and Cairo, and educated in the United States, where he attended Princeton (B.A. 1957) and Harvard (M.A. 1960; Ph.D. 1964). In 1963, he began teaching at Columbia University, where he was University Professor of English and Comparative Literature. He is the author of twenty-two books which have been translated into 35 languages, including <i>Orientalism</i> (1978); <i>The Question of Palestine</i> (1979); <i>Covering Islam</i> (1980);&nbsp;<i>Culture and Imperialism</i> (1993); <i>Peace and Its Discontents</i> (1996);&nbsp;and <i>Out of Place: A Memoir</i> (1999). Besides his academic work, he wrote a twice-monthly column for <i>Al-Hayat</i> and <i>Al-Ahram</i>; was a regular contributor to newspapers in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East; and was the music critic for <i>The Nation</i>. He died in 2003 in New York City.</p><h2>Armageddon: The Battle for Germany 1944-45</h2><p>A stunning new book from one of Britain&#39;s most highly regarded military historians destined to be the Keegan of his generation One of the greatest military feats during the Second World War was the transformation of the German force&#39;s activities in the weeks following the battles in Holland and the German border, where the Allies had finally inflicted the greatest catastrophes of modern war on them. Somehow the Germans found the strength to halt the Allied advance in its tracks and to prolong the war to 1945. This book is the epic story of those last eight months of the war in northern Europe. &#39;As a military historian Max Hastings has few equals&#39; Times Literary Supplement &#39;Max Hastings now stands in the first rank of writers on modern war&#39; Financial Times</p><p><i>Armageddon</i> is the epic story of the last eight months of World War II in Europe by Max Hastings&#x2013;one of Britain&#x2019;s most highly regarded military historians, whose accounts of past battles John Keegan has described as worthy &#x201c;to stand with that of the best journalists and writers&#x201d; (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>).<br><br>In September 1944, the Allies believed that Hitler&#x2019;s army was beaten, and expected that the war would be over by Christmas. But the disastrous Allied airborne landing in Holland, American setbacks on the German border and in the H�rtgen Forest, together with the bitter Battle of the Bulge, drastically altered that timetable. Hastings tells the story of both the Eastern and Western Fronts, and paints a vivid portrait of the Red Army&#x2019;s onslaught on Hitler&#x2019;s empire. He has searched the archives of the major combatants and interviewed 170 survivors to give us an unprecedented understanding of how the great battles were fought, and of their human impact on American, British, German, and Russian soldiers and civilians. <br><br>Hastings raises provocative questions: Were the Western Allied cause and campaign compromised by a desire to get the Soviets to do most of the fighting? Why were the Russians and Germans more effective soldiers than the Americans and British? Why did the bombing of Germany&#x2019;s cities continue until the last weeks of the war, when it could no longer influence the outcome? Why did the Germans prove more fanatical foes than the Japanese, fighting to the bitter end? This book also contains vivid portraits of Stalin, Churchill, Eisenhower, Montgomery, and the other giants of the struggle. <br><br>The crucial final months of the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest global conflict come alive in this rousing and revelatory chronicle.MAX HASTINGS, author of eighteen books, was editor of the Daily Telegraph for almost a decade, then for six years edited the Evening Standard. In his youth he was a foreign correspondent for newspapers and BBC television. He has won many awards for his journalism, particularly his work in the South Atlantic in 1982. He was knighted in 2002.</p><h2>American Rifle Design and Performance</h2><p>A rifle has but one function--to deliver an appropriate bullet to an exact spot and in such a way that the bullet can perform the task assigned to it and to do so repeatedly many thousands of times. How any individual rifle performs this functions in part dependent upon the skill of the shooter, but far more so upon the skills of those who designed it, machined it, and worked up the load for it. The questions those people faced are what this book is about. Drawing upon the experience and knowledge that made him a highly respected custom gunsmith and the skill he developed during a career in advertising, Mr. Wallack has written a comprehensive and lucid guide to what happens inside a rifle when the trigger is pulled, why it happens, and what happens to the bullet in flight and upon impact. Translating complex engineering concepts into plain English, Wallack describes the various actions available today in sporting rifles, from the lever-action model that won the West to modern bolt and semiautomatic actions. He also discusses feeding and firing systems, extraction and ejection systems, barrels and stocks, and scopes and sights. In Part II, Wallack takes up calibers and cartridges, primers and propellants, and tells what happens to the bullet when the rifle is fired. In addition to the charts, diagrams, and the some 150 photos, a special fold-out section in full color has been included, giving pertinent statistical information on the most popular commercially manufactured sporting cartridges in use today. All in all, Wallack has managed not only to impart his all-but-encyclopedic knowledge of guns and gundom, but to do so in a way that is refreshing, clear and totally comprehensible.</p><p></p><h2>Momo.</h2><p>Used.

A young, highly intelligent man named Christian Longo, on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list for killing his entire family, has recently been captured in Mexico, where he'd taken on a new identity -- Michael Finkel of the <em>New York Times</em>.</p><p>The next day, on page A-3 of the <em>Times</em>, comes another bit of troubling news: a note, written by the paper's editors, explaining that Finkel has falsified parts of an investigative article and has been fired. This unlikely confluence sets the stage for a bizarre and intense relationship. After Longo's arrest, the only journalist the accused murderer will speak with is the real Michael Finkel. And as the months until Longo's trial tick away, the two men talk for dozens of hours on the telephone, meet in the jailhouse visiting room, and exchange nearly a thousand pages of handwritten letters.</p><p>With Longo insisting he can prove his innocence, Finkel strives to uncover what really happened to Longo's family, and his quest becomes less a reporting job than a psychological cat-and-mouse game -- sometimes redemptively honest, other times slyly manipulative. Finkel's pursuit pays off only at the end, when Longo, after a lifetime of deception, finally says what he wouldn't even admit in court -- the whole, true story. Or so it seems.</p></p><p>In <i>True Story: Murder, Memoir, Mea Culpa</i>, disgraced <i>New York Times</i> writer Michael Finkel recounts the story of the murderer who assumed his identity and examines the reasons for his own fall from journalistic grace, in a memoir that is gripping, perceptive, and bizarre. In 2002, Finkel, a rising star at the <i>Times</i>, was fired for fabricating a character in a story about child laborers in Africa. Just as the story of his downfall was about to become public, he learned that a man named Christian Longo, arrested in Mexico for the murder of his wife and three small children in Oregon, had been living under an assumed identity: Michael Finkel of <i>The New York Times</i>. Sensing a story--and an opportunity for redemption--Finkel contacted Longo, initiating a relationship that would grow increasingly complex over the course of Longo's trial and conviction.<p> Finkel makes no excuses for his actions. Nor does he deny his own narcissism--a narcissism that allowed him to rationalize his own lies as surely as Longo rationalized his crimes. Ultimately, Finkel says, his year with Longo taught him "how a person's life could spiral completely out of control; how one could get lost in a haze of dishonesty; and how these things could have dire consequences." The lesson, Finkel need not add, applies as much to the disgraced writer as it does to the killer. <i>--Erica C.

Guidelines are given to making these choices, and the way to dress in a kimono, from the preliminaries to tieing the bustle sash, is described in detail and fully illustrated. For women, there are formal kimono, obi and accessories, and the lightweight summer yukata; for men, the yukata and the ceremonial ensemble of kimono, haori coat and hakama skirt. Children's kimono for festive events are also described. <br><br>Kimono fashions have evolved over the centuries in response to varied influences. Today modern innovations are making the wearing of kimono at home and elsewhere an attractive alternative to Western garments. These are included here, along with a discussion of aesthetics, the history of the kimono, and the meaning that kimono culture can have for wearers and admirers throughout the world.</p><p><br>NORIO YAMANAKA was born in Shiga Prefecture in 1928. In 1964 he founded the Sodo Kimono Academy, the first institute of its kind to encourage the wearing of Japan's national dress in everyday life. His philosophy is that wearing the kimono properly depends as much on the person's inner nature as on the garment itself. His movement has spread throughout Japan, and more than five million people have been taught how to wear the kimono by the fifty thousand consultants the academy has graduated. <br><br>Mr. Yamanaka was appointed chairman of the All Japan Kimono Consultants Association when it was formed in 1969. He is the author of several books on the kimono in Japanese, and since 1970 he has annually led delegations of more than a hundred members each, traveling to forty-five countries in Asia, Europe and North and South America to familiarize other people with this form of dress. In 1980 and 1982 he was invited to the United Nations headquarters in New York, where he lectured and gave demonstrations on the theme of the kimono and Japanese culture.<br></p><h2>Prelude to Glory, Vol. 3: To Decide Our Destiny</h2><p>By the end of 1776, the Continental army is faced with the overwhelming truth that they are losing the Revolution. The British have pummeled them with a series of bloody battles that have shattered the American army and have forced them into a desperate retreat.

Tour.</p><p>Freelancer Carroll, who apparently debauched with the legendary gonzo journalist, recounts her experiences here in the precious, faux gonzo voice of a semi-fictionalized alter ego, Laetitia Snap ("Truth being excusable in a Biographer . . ."). She intersperses her Thompson escapades with an oral biography, assembling quotes rather than crafting a narrative. Carroll's interviewees--including Thompson's brother, mother, ex-girlfriend, ex-wife, colleagues, even George McGovern--offer many interesting observations on her subject's alienated youth, writing style, celebrityhood, behavior and journalistic influence. "He's both ultimately sane and crazy," declares one friend. Paul Perry's Fear and Loathing: The Strange and Terrible Saga of Hunter S. Thompson (Nonfiction Forecasts, Nov. 16) is a more coherent biography; also, although Perry had fewer sources than Carroll, he had one she didn't: Thompson's sidekick illustrator Ralph Steadman.

The introduction is by Edumund A. Opitz, founder, the Nockian Society.</p><p><p>How wonderful to have this book back in print! If any libertarian work is to graced with the word "classic," this is it. Nock was without a doubt one of the most learned and eloquent spokesmen for individual liberty who ever lived. Our Enemy, the State, published in 1935, combines history, politics social theory into a poignant appeal for natural rights, free markets, and peace. The style sores. The power of this work has never been matched.<br> This edition includes an extra treat: Nock's wonderful essay "On Doing the Right Thing," a profound affirmation of man's fitness for freedom and nobility. Also included here are two stunning pieces from Walter E. Grinder of the Institute for Humane Studies: an introduction on Nock's life and the meaning of his work, and a bibliography that anyone interested in liberty should be familiar with.<br> For Nock, the state is not some faceless institution that somehow appears and works its will mysteriously. Drawing on Franz Oppenheimer's The State, Nock notes that "the State invariably had its origins in conquest and confiscation" and is a tool used by one class to exploit another. Here he stands foursquare in the tradition of the earlier French classical-liberal class analysts Comte and Dunoyer, who originated the view that the State is the source of the classes that later came to be called taxpayers and tax-eaters.<br> The barely touches the surface of Nock's analysis, however, which is endlessly rich and powerful. Buy Our Enemy, the State; be inspired by it. You will read it many times. -- Sheldon L. Richman</p><p>Nock's Our Enemy, the State is a great and seminal work, in which Nock, in his justly renowned style, introduces the vital libertarian concepts of "State power" and "Social power," an applies them to American history. "Social power" is people freely creating and voluntarily exchanging and interacting, and is responsible for Western prosperity and civilization. "State power" is the age-old process by which force and theft combine to cripple and confiscate the fruits of Social power. Nowhere can the reader find a clearer or more forceful portrayal of the libertarian position than in this book.--Murray N. Rothbard in Laissez Faire Review -- Murray N.

It deals with that delightful decade from the Armistice in November 1918 to the panic and depression of 1929-30. Here is the story of Woodrow Wilson's defeat, the Harding scandals, the Coolidge prosperity, the revolution in manners and morals, the bull market and its smash-up. Allen's lively narrative brings back, revitalized and freshly interpreted, an endless variety of half-forgotten events and fashions, crazes and absurdities. He neglects neither the play of political, social, and economic forces in American life nor those tremendous trifles which immediately concerned ordinary people-the significance of short skirts, Eskimo pies, flagpole sitting. </p><p><i>Since Yesterday,</i> which is as gracefully written as its predecessor, picks up where the first book ends. Recapping the period of feverish stock market activity that preceded the Crash of 1929, it goes on to look at what happened in the decade that followed, from September 3, 1929, to September 3, 1939. Allen examines the Depression, the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the beginning of the New Deal, the Dust Bowl, the way Americans worked (and didn't work), how they played. He covers the fashions of the times, gangsterism, politics, unions, Hollywood, and a great deal more.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Art of the Cake: Modern French Baking and Decorating</h2><p>More than four hundred clear, step-by-step photographs highlight a collection of some one hundred classic French cake recipes, simplified for modern kitchens, including pound cake, sponge cake, and mousse cakes, as well as more than forty recipes for glazes, frostings, sauces, and fillings. 17,500 first printing.</p><p>French cakes comprise a luscious repertoire.

Recognizing the need for a technically comprehensive yet approachable introduction to French cake making for the home baker, cooking-school owner Bruce Healy and French pastry chef Paul Bugat have created a true teaching book. <i>The Art of the Cake</i> will appeal to anyone interested in French cake making, but will be of particular importance to serious bakers who have, perhaps, sought just this kind of work.</p><p> In the first of three parts, the book explores plain cakes, sponge and nut-meringue g�teaux, bavarians, charlottes, mousse cakes, logs, loaves, and more. Healy and Bugnat then offer more than 40 recipes for fillings, frostings, and finishes; notes on ingredients and equipment; a discussion of general techniques; and source listings. More than 400 step-by-step illustrations help readers assemble a sponge log or pipe meringues, for example, and 32 pages of color photos reveal the finished products in all their platonic glory. The authors occasionally overdilate on procedures and other matters, but in general provide just the right balance of detail and concision. Dipping into this near-encyclopedic but seductive guide, it would be difficult not to feel the call of the g�teaux and make a beeline for the kitchen. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Bruce Healy, a former theoretical physicist, left that career path to pursue his passion for French food, particularly French pastry.

Although the plot is thin and the characters one-dimensional, this story works well on the level of sheer farce. Korman is good at creating chaotic, if not always believable, situations. And although not all of the jokes work and the perspective is somewhat adult, this book has a fast pace and an amusing, goofy tone that many kids will enjoy. --Todd Morning, Schaumburg Township Pub .

Now I want more." <b>-</b>-Nick Antosca, author of <i>The Girlfriend Game</i> and <i>Midnight Picnic</i></p><p> "Elizabeth Hand's HARD LIGHT is a pitch-perfect punk noir that makes a speed-fueled, mad-dash tour through an avant garde underbelly London and the lost landscape of rural England. It's about the lost, the heartbreakingly ephemeral, and the melancholy timelessness of art and love and murder. It's a tour de force. It's a great goddamn book. If you haven't met Cass Neary yet, do so before you get a well-deserved steel-toe to the knee." --Paul Tremblay, author of<i> A Head Full of Ghosts </i>and <i>The Little Sleep</i></p><p>?&#x201c;Beloved scrapper, fight-picker, and trouble-finder Cass Neary returns for another installment in Elizabeth Hand's gorgeous, searing, speed-fueled bender of a series. Both fearless and vulnerable, heroic and haunted, Neary is a heroine like no other: a punk-rock valkyrie whose fierce intelligence and harrowing quests, rendered in Hand's flawless, ice-clear prose, have redefined a genre.

Don't miss her new novel, <i>Do Not Become Alarmed</i>.&nbsp;<br></b><br> Meloy's first return to short stories since her critically acclaimed debut,&nbsp;<i>Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It</i>&nbsp;is an extraordinary new work from one of the most promising writers of the last decade.<br><br> Eleven unforgettable new stories demonstrate the emotional power and the clean, assured style that have earned Meloy praise from critics and devotion from readers. Propelled by a terrific instinct for storytelling, and concerned with the convolutions of modern love and the importance of place, this collection is about the battlefields-and fields of victory-that exist in seemingly harmless spaces, in kitchens and living rooms and cars. Set mostly in the American West, the stories feature small-town lawyers, ranchers, doctors, parents, and children, and explore the moral quandaries of love, family, and friendship. A ranch hand falls for a recent law school graduate who appears unexpectedly- and reluctantly-in his remote Montana town. A young father opens his door to find his dead grandmother standing on the front step. Two women weigh love and betrayal during an early snow. Throughout the book, Meloy examines the tensions between having and wanting, as her characters try to keep hold of opposing forces in their lives: innocence and experience, risk and stability, fidelity and desire.<br><br> Knowing, sly, and bittersweet,&nbsp;<i>Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It</i>&nbsp;confirms Maile Meloy's singular literary talent. Her lean, controlled prose, full of insight and unexpected poignancy, is the perfect complement to her powerfully moving storytelling.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, July 2009:</strong> There is one line in Maile Meloy's newest story collection that completely slayed me. (It's on page 97.) And in fact, there are many moments before and after that line that left me awestruck as I wondered how she was able to capture a feeling--typically one that's very familiar, like the flushing embarrassment of an unexpected advance, or the sudden fury found in a bout of sibling rivalry--and create it anew. The effect is both masterful and ephemeral: all of a sudden, it's as if your own life is reflected back to you. This is what great story writers do, and in the stories that follow--whose characters revel or unravel in their relationships to love and family--Maile Meloy pinpoints the ambivalence running through our most powerful emotions, be it love, jealousy, grief, or loneliness. That she writes with so much truth and wisdom and restraint makes <em>Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It</em> an unexpected pleasure and a worthy outside-the-box pick for your summer reading. <em>--Anne Bartholomew</em><br> <br> <br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Maile Meloy on Arranging Stories</strong><br><br> My most recent book, <em>Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It</em>, is a story collection, as was my first. Lately people have been asking me about how you decide which stories to include in a collection, and what order they go in, which was (and still is) a big question of mine. <br><br>When I was writing the stories that became my first book, <em>Half in Love</em>, I read great collections to see how it was done: Philip Roth&#x2019;s <em>Goodbye, Columbus</em>; J.D. Salinger&#x2019;s <em>Nine Stories</em>; Merce Rodereda's <em>My Christina</em>; D.H. Lawrence's <em>England, My England</em>; Hemingway's <em>In Our Time</em>. I wanted to know how the arrangement of eight or ten or twelve stories could create a complete experience that the reader could move through, when the stories weren't linked in any way except for the fact that one writer wrote them, but it was hard to see how I could transfer that information to my own book. <br><br>I was taking a class from Ann Patchett then, and she said, about the number of stories in a collection, that Salinger's <em>Nine </em>was like eight hours sleep&#x2014;a little more was okay, a little less was fine, but it was a good general guideline. About variety, she said that a collection was like a mall: it needed a few big stories with broad horizons, like the big anchor stores, to make a space in which the smaller, quirkier stories could survive. <br><br>That made sense, so in putting <em>Half in Love</em> together I took some stories out, and left others in, and set aside two linked ones to start a novel with. I made lists of the titles, and annotated them with codes about what was in each story, some of which were so obscure I can't decipher them now. (One was "adbhj." I have no idea what that means.) The easily breakable codes indicated that the story was in 1st person, or 3rd, or 2nd, and whether the protagonist was male or female, and where the story was set. Then I cut the lists apart and moved the titles around on the kitchen table. I spent a long time trying to keep the first-person stories away from each other, before realizing that I didn't need to, that it wasn't difficult to move from one first-person narrator to another. We're used to hearing different voices telling us things about their lives, and I ended up having four in a row. <br><br>I did the same thing for <em>Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It</em>, with the annotated titles on cut-up pieces of sticky notes, so they would stay in place&#x2014;an improvement on the method. Otherwise, the arranging hadn't gotten any easier. I knew which title went first, and had a sense about which one might go last, but I moved the middle around for days, trying different sequences. <br><br>I got out Salinger's <em>Nine </em>again, because it struck me as the Platonic ideal of a story collection, and I thought about it as a template, wondering which story was my "DeDaumier Smith's Blue Period," and which was my "Teddy." But that came to seem futile and silly, and I went back to thinking about my own stories. <br><br>I put a story set in Connecticut third, after two Montana stories, so it was clear that the collection was going to go to other places. And there were two stories that made sense near each other, but needed to be separated, like quarreling siblings. The story about a man whose daughter has been murdered couldn't go early. It had to go somewhere in the middle, at a point when the reader was already in the book. And it seemed good to have a lighter story after it, about a grandmother who comes back from the dead. <br><br>Sometimes the arranging felt like lining up the batting order for a baseball game: which story leads off? And sometimes it felt like seating people at a dinner party: boy-girl-boy-girl if possible, and certain stories shouldn't go next to each other, and try to encourage interesting conversation. And sometimes it felt like making a mix tape for someone you love. But mostly it felt like a puzzle with a discoverable solution, and moving the pieces around was part of the pleasure. <br> <br>Maile Meloy is the author of the story collection <i>Half in Love</i>, and the novels <i>Liars and Saints</i>, shortlisted for the 2005 Orange Prize, and <i>A Family Daughter</i>.

In a rich, eloquent voice that resonates with both small-town wisdom and haut monde sophistication, Talley tells of the grandmother who encouraged his dreams and ambitions while instilling in him an abiding sense of dignity and style, and of the legendary fashion doyenne who took him under her wing as he rose to fame in the wild New York of the 1970s. Threaded throughout are stories of the man himself, who has survived thirty years in the &#x201c;chiffon trenches&#x201d; with eminent grace and style.<br><br>Clear, elegant, and often magical, A.L.T. shines like a rare jewel as it illuminates three extraordinary lives.</p><p>&#x201c;Andr� Leon Talley&#x2019;s memoir is a remarkable story. It is the solid building of a man, from honest, dignified beginnings, with unfailing integrity and values, and a profound respect for the human soul. It is the story of a journey from goodness to glamour, without ever losing the goodness along the way. The book is, as Talley is himself, about the elegance of the human spirit, and the genuine luxury of love. His deep respect and genuine affection for women, embodied by his grandmother at first, and the illustrious Diana Vreeland at last, shine throughout.<br>&#x201c;The book demonstrates The American Dream, from humble beginnings to glory, not in a single leap, but in slow, graceful, measured steps, never losing sight of the right goals: friendship, kindness, compassion, generosity, honesty and love. Andr� Leon Talley clearly loves the young, the real, or even the unreal, if honest and carried out with sufficient style and panache. His own profound belief in &#x2018;goodness,&#x2019; generosity, love and integrity shines through on every page. I was deeply moved by the book, and am proud to be his friend.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Danielle Steel</b><br><br>&#x201c;From the waters of the well, Andr� Leon Talley fashions a new translation of black life writing. His elegant style resonates the life and language of a brilliant reader of great writers&#x2014;Toni Morrison, Gustave Flaubert, Jorge Luis Borges&#x2014;and cultural texts. Sunday mornings with his grandmother at church; a master&#x2019;s in French studies at Brown University; marvelous women everywhere influence the deep sensibility of this world-class critic and historian of haute couture. His impeccable descriptions define and expand the borders of Vogue. With amazing grace, Talley narrates &#x2018;chanting memories&#x2019; of love, beauty, struggle, and home.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b>Professor Janis A. Mayes</b>, Department of African American Studies (African and Diasporan Literatures in French and English languages), Syracuse University <br><br>&#x201c;I liked this book so much because it describes Andr�&#x2019;s fascination and deep understanding of beauty and elegance since he was young. What impressed me the most was the pleasure these things gave him. You understand it from the description of the sheets smelling of sun or from the way gloves and hats were put in order in the closet.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Miuccia Prada</b><br><br>&#x201c;For those who know Andr� Leon Talley, as one reads, one can almost hear his voice telling these stories of his life experiences with laughter and tears. Stories of enchanted memories of a sainted ancestor and a flamboyant mentor. Stories enshrined in his heart and shared with all of us through poetic recollections.<br>&#x201c;From Sundays at Mt. Sinai Baptist Church in Orange County, North Carolina, to the French chateau of Karl Lagerfeld, Andr� Leon Talley paints colorful pictures of life filled with style and grace that are both instructive and entertaining. <br>&#x201c;Young adults should read this book. It celebrates luxurious living that is rooted not in the material, but in the spiritual. Andr� Leon Talley&#x2019;s sense of the feminine, and his celebration of the highest elements of style, make this a must-read memoir.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Rev. Dr. Calvin O.

Nine of the crew were lifted from the ship and dropped aboard a nearby Coast Guard cutter. But during attempts to save the last eight crew members, one of the Jayhawks was engulfed by a rogue wave that broke over the bow of the ship. When its engines flamed out from ingesting water, the Jayhawk crashed into the sea. The seven crew members from the ship who had been hoisted into the aircraft, along with the chopper&#x2019;s three-man crew, plunged into the bitterly cold ocean where hypothermia began to set in immediately. <p></p>Interviewing all the surviving participants of the disaster and given access to documents and photos, acclaimed author Spike Walker has once again crafted a white-knuckle read of survival and death in the unforgiving Alaskan waters.</p><p>SPIKE WALKER spent more than ten seasons aboard some of the most successful crab boats in the Alaskan fleet, and rode out one of the worst storms in Alaska&#x2019;s history. He is the author of <i>Working on the Edge, Nights of Ice </i>and <i>Coming Back Alive. </i>Spike lives in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.ONE<br>Slammed right and left by battering, 60 mph wind gusts, blinded by snow squalls at the leading edge of an Arctic storm, search and rescue pilot Lieutenant David Neel was doing his best, early on that cold December morning in 2004, to shake off the sudden bouts of vertigo and keep his H-60 helicopter on course and in the air. Flying along over the gray and white, foam- streaked waters of the Bering Sea, Neel maintained an altitude of just three hundred feet, and no more, to prevent icing as the tall, clutching storm waves lumbered past below. He and his crew had been ordered to Dutch Harbor, where they would refuel and prepare to launch out on an emerging crisis: The Selen dang Ayu, a giant of a freighter, a 738-foot-lonag cargo ship bound for China with over 60,000 metric tons of Pacific Northwest soybeans, had apparently lost her engine while following the Great Circle route across those same, intractable waters 170 miles northwest of Dutch Harbor. With some 455,000 gallons of bulk oil stored in her tanks, and twenty- six sailors trapped aboard her, the freighter was now drifting on a collision course with the hull-crushing shores of the Aleutian Islands.<br>If no one was able to alter her freewheeling advance, and efforts either to restart her engine or pass a towline to her failed, the freighter would soon be driven onto the rocks of Unalaska Island inside the largest maritime seabird nesting area in all of North America. Should an oil spill ensue&#x2014;a distinct possibility, given the furious, wind- driven seas now propelling the ship along&#x2014;the impact on those vulnerable creatures could be disastrous, the damage to the environment largely irreparable.<br>The Panamax-class vessel, the largest of the bulk freighters whose hull could still fit through the Panama Canal, was said to be drifting beam-to the pummeling waves. Some of the prodigious breakers slamming into her and driving her toward shore were reportedly as large as freight train boxcars. At times, the wayward vessel was rolling so wildly from side to side, that the six hundred or so feet of her massive deck was tilting almost vertically.<br>The weather reports, too, were equally alarming. A storm packing blizzard snows with peak wind gusts approaching hurricane force was currently drafting down out of Rus sia's Siberian Arctic. Accelerating as it came, the cold front had marched down over the polar ice pack, and was now racing unhindered across the vast, open reaches of the Bering Sea.<br>Dave Neel was certain, however, that well before the peak of the storm reached them, he and his crew would be sent to the scene with orders to hoist as many of the sailors as possible off the Selendang Ayu's deck before she sank, ran aground, or rolled over. But he also knew that plucking survivors off the heaving deck of a freighter careening through high seas wouldn't be easy; and that doing so in as little time as possible would be absolutely imperative.<br>Born and raised in Vian, Oklahoma&#x2014;a town of just 1,200 people, surrounded by farmland&#x2014;Dave Neel grew up hunting and fishing, was a fifth-generation Oklahoman, and the son of a bricklayer. His people worked in the construction trade. Dirt moving. Concrete pouring Home building. His parents raised him and his brothers in a traditional, God-fearing, Baptist belief system, one centered around hard work, honest living, and fair play.<br>Neel knew the H-60 Jayhawk helicopter well. He'd flown them for years in the army, and also on a tour for the Coast Guard (CG) out of Clearwater, Florida. But the base outside Kodiak was this aviator's ultimate destination, a place reserved for the Coast Guard's most trusted and experienced pilots. Only second-tour aviators or better were sent there. In fact, famed Alaskan chopper pilot Russ Zullick was one of Dave Neel's best friends.<br>Just twelve hours before, Neel and his crew had been sitting in the cargo hold of a C-130, crossing the Shumagin Islands, when Commander (Cdr.) Bill Deal called him forward into the aircraft's cockpit and told him of the crisis building in the Bering Sea. Their C-130 was being diverted to Cold Bay. An H-60 would be waiting. Neel and his crew needed to start planning the rescue.<br>Recognizing a true crisis in the making, Coast Guard officials had also ordered the cutter Alex Haley, to the scene. In addition, they'd dispatched several tugboats, including the oceangoing tug Sidney Foss and the harbor tug James Dunlap to try to intercept the drifting giant before it ran aground, scattering fuel, cargo, and bodies along the wild, inhospitable shores of Unalaska Island.<br>Cdr. Matt Bell, the captain on the Coast Guard cutter Alex Haley, was about 150 miles away, monitoring the actions of a fleet of codfish longliners, when he received word of the errant freighter's path and location. Bell and his crew were just winding down from fifty or so days of patroling the westernmost reaches of the Bering Sea along the U.S./Russia border, and were about to stand down and steam back to Kodiak for a well-deserved bit of R &amp; R. But now Bell was ordered to locate the vessel, and to assess the situation.<br>Riding a quartering sea, and moving in the direction of the freighter with all possible urgency, Cdr. Bell set out in hot pursuit of the freighter. However, because the seas were rough, the Alex Haley could only move at ten knots (11 mph), and it would be a number of hours before they would catch up with the Selendang Ayu. But with half a dozen engineers reportedly among the vessel's crew, Cdr. Bell thought the Ayu's crew might get their engine back up and running before he even caught sight of her.<br>Standing six feet tall, and weighing a lean 170 pounds, Cdr. Bell was well suited for the duty at hand. Raised in Georgia by family-oriented parents, he was taught the fundamentals of discipline, work, and academic achievement, a lifestyle that was also accompanied by robust outdoor living.<br>As a small boy, his first exposure to the sea was while camping and fishing for Spanish mackerel at the water's edge of Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. During those impressionable years, the Coast Guard bug bit him hard, for he often observed the gleaming white patrol boats cruising the inlets and passageways that wind their way through the beautiful archipelago of islands that make up that seaboard region.<br>&#x201c;Our summer house was on the inland waterways there,&#x201d; he recalls. &#x201c;You had to take the pass down through all the back bays to get to the jetty before you could get out to the ocean.&#x201d;<br>Bell's father, a Marine formerly stationed on Okinawa, was a &#x201c;hunter-camper-fisher,&#x201d; says Bell. &#x201c;I think he was handed a fishing pole to hold before he could even walk.&#x201d; Along with four brothers and one sister, Matt Bell took naturally to the outdoors. Never bothered by seasickness, he loved fishing with his father, and joined him every chance he got.<br>&#x201c;I don't know if I could even name a more patriotic guy than my father,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Pledge of Allegiance. Love of God and country. My dad believed that serving one's country was both a duty and an honor.&#x201d;<br>In 1985, Matt Bell joined the Coast Guard. In a very real sense, it seems Cdr. Bell had been headed into the military from the get-go. Surviving boot camp, he was quickly scooped up and sent to Officer Candidate School (OCS). Steady promotions followed solid tours of duty out of the port cities of New Orleans and San Francisco. One of Cdr. Bell's first SAR (search and rescue) cases was picking up debris off the Florida coast after the space shuttle Challenger exploded, and its entire crew was killed.<br>In 1987, Cdr. Bell and his family were assigned to the base in Kodiak, Alaska. At that time he began serving on board Coast Guard cutter patrols in the Bering Sea.<br>Now, some seventeen years later, and a veteran at navigating those untamed waters, Cdr. Bell pointed the Alex Haley in the direction of the disabled freighter, and gave chase.<br>Eventually, as the Alex Haley began to close in on the drifting hulk, Cdr. Bell's officer of the deck (OD) was able to make radio contact with the skipper of the Selen dang Ayu. It was still dark out when they finally caught up with her. Cdr. Bell and his executive officer (X/O), Lieutenant Commander (LCDR) Phil Thorne, stepped out on the flying bridge for a better look.<br>&#x201c;Wow! She's a big one!&#x201d; said Bell, peering at the long, well-lighted wheelhouse and wave-thrashed deck through his powerful field glasses. &#x201c;We're sure going to need those tugs.&#x201d;<br>Inside the C-130 being diverted to Cold Bay, Dave Neel returned to the cargo area, grabbed his maps, and gave fellow co-pilot Lt. Doug Watson the &#x201c;quick skinny&#x201d; on the situation. Next, he presented the news to flight mechanic Petty Officer 2nd Class Brian Lickfield, and rescue swimmer Petty Officer 3rd Class Aaron Bean. Then, he sat and did some brainstorming: &#x201c;How much gas would it take to reach the scene? How long will I be able to remain there?<br>How many people can I carry in the H-60 in a single load?&#x201d;<br>Initially, Neel calculated that he could carry nine of the stranded sailors per load. Flying the H-60 helicopter directly to the scene&#x2014;its call sign CG6020&#x2014;they'd gather them up and take them immediately to Dutch Harbor, top off the fuel tanks again, and rush back for more of the Selendang Ayu's crew. He and his flight crew would make the turnaround in Dutch Harbor in record time.<br>Meanwhile, Cdr. Doug Cameron, the officer in charge of CG6021, the other H-60 Jayhawk, would hoist the second load of nine off the freighter. That would be eighteen saved, leaving just eight, including the ship's captain, to go. Neel and Watson would race back then, hover in close and, if all went well, load up the last of the survivors in as little as fifteen minutes, and they'd be out of there.<br>But if things should go sideways on them, there were certain realities to consider. For one, the edge of the polar ice pack was now floating just north of the Pribilof Islands, which meant that the waters of the Bering Sea, at that time of the year, would be only a couple of degrees above freezing. In addition, their mission would draw them out over those wind-ravaged waters at about the same time the heart of the storm reached them.<br>The moment their C-130 touched down in Cold Bay, Dave Neel called Kodiak and spoke with Cdr. Bob Phillips, his ops officer. He wanted to get a better picture of what, exactly, was happening. Phillips told him to stand down on launching the H-60 and await further instructions.<br>&#x201c;Hold tight there in Cold Bay,&#x201d; said Phillips. &#x201c;We're sending another H-60 down. It'll be there later tonight. So far, it looks like you guys might not have to go out, because the oceangoing tugboat Sidney Foss is responding. So just stand fast for now.&#x201d;<br>It was well after dark when the second H-60 arrived from its base on Kodiak Island. Pilots Guy &#x201c;Yogi&#x201d; Pierce and Larry Quedado (since deceased) had flown over with it. But with no room left inside the hangar, they were forced to park it outside on the snow-covered runway.<br>Born and raised in Cranford, New Jersey, fellow pilot Doug Watson was five foot ten, weighed 180 pounds, had sandy blond hair, and was widely recognized as a superb helicopter pilot. He had earned a bachelor's degree in aeronautical science from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. Trained, initially, to be a professional or corporate pilot, Watson was also a certified flight instructor.<br>Signing on with the Coast Guard was an unusual move for someone with his background. He'd attended Officer Candidate School for eighteen months in Pensacola, Florida, then spent another six weeks in Mobile, Alabama, learning to fly the legendary H-60 Jayhawk helicopter. For the next four years he flew missions out of Air Station Clearwater on the Florida coast, before joining the exceptional band of flyboys at Air Station Kodiak.<br>As a seasoned pilot, now several years into his Alaskan tour, Doug Watson had, of course, been in some very tight spots of his own. Should they need him to fly on such an icy, windswept night, he felt fully up to the challenge.<br>While outside an arctic wind raked the frozen ground, inside Bill and Mary Cochran's hospitable Cold Bay Lodge, Dave Neel, Doug Watson, Aaron Bean, and Brian Lickfield&#x2014;and their Coast Guard brothers&#x2014;sat themselves down to a hearty Alaskan meal of steak and king crab, with all the trimmings.<br>After dinner, Dave Neel and Doug Watson had withdrawn to their respective rooms and were fast asleep when word of the developing drama reached them. It was flight mechanic Joe Metzler who delivered the news: They were to launch their H-60 as soon as possible.<br>Outside, it was pitch dark. Numbing winds driving a blizzard snow were howling across the runway and throughout the Aleutian Islands, creating an aviator's nightmare over much of the Bering Sea. The tugboat Sidney Foss's efforts to take the huge ship in tow had ultimately failed. Metzler informed them that they were to preposition them<br>Excerpted from On The Edge of Survival by Spike Walker.<br>Copyright � 2010 by Spike Walker.<br>Published in 2010 by St. Martin's Press<br>All rights reserved.

If you want something unique. If you think comic book swimsuit issues are the dumbest thing since Jesse Helms, then here it is, a hot bundle of short stories, a la graphic novel style. <p>Not only does Weird Business contain tales by Edgar Allan Poe, Ambrose Bierce, and the late, great Robert Bloch, it contains mostly original material that will, to put it mildly, blow the doors off your Chevy. From pure fantasy to dark horror, to humorous whimsy, to noir, to action/adventure and science fiction, this baby is as hot as the devil's cigar. </p><p>With 23 stories, 56 creators, and 420 pages Weird Business is the largest original comic ever produced in the English language. </p><p>Weird Business was nominated for the 1996 Eisner Award for best anthology and hailed by the Rocky Mountain News as "Possibly the greatest comic ever."</p></p><p>Dedicated to, and very much in the humor-loving spirit of, the late Robert Bloch, this original anthology of mostly black-and-white horror comics is a beautiful book to have and to hold, and is great fun to read. Don't expect literary subtlety from this one--these are <i>comics,</i> after all--and your horror thirst will be slaked by stories in which blood flows, corpses move, monsters romp, skull-faced demons walk the night, and only rarely does the good guy win. The stories are almost all by established horror prose writers, ranging from contemporary pros like Norman Partridge and F. Paul Wilson, to adaptations of classics like Edgar A. Poe's "Masque of the Red Death" and Ambrose Bierce's "Oil of Dog." The artwork is by 20-some different artists, and exhibits a range of graphic styles, including some on the cutting edge of today's comics."A must read!" --Overstreet's Fan <p>"I wouldn't call Weird Business a comic book, though it is, strictly speaking, a book filled with comics. It is rather, a hefty 414-page (sic) hardcover, just out from Mojo Press, which gathers a broad spectrum of weird and horrible tales from a truly impressive range of writers. The price is up there at $29.95, but when you consider that in traditional comic book format you would probably break this collection down to about 16 comics for which you would expect to pay about $3.00 apiece... well, it would add up to even more. If horror, dark fantasy, and weird business is your pleasure, then Weird Business is for you.....truly impressive but what's even more remarkable, is how smooth the synthesis of art and text is on so many of these pieces. Only a couple of these 23 tales are by a single person, but many of these are so craftily blended I wouldn't have guessed they were by several people." -- Marianne Jablon from her column "Costumes Optional" in N.I.C.E. News Monthly (the monthly publication from Mile High Comics) </p><p>"I've been using Richard Klaw and Joe R. Lansdale's lavish graphic novel anthology Weird Business as a device of seduction (literary, natch) for convincing dedicated readers who say, 'But I don't read comics!' to give the graphic form a try. It works....Weird Business would make a wonderful gift book. But read it first before you pass it on." -- Edward Bryant, Locus </p><p>"Considering that routine hardcovers these days run about $20 with no frills, this book is a bargain. The back cover carries the name of 56 contributors, and the contents contain many memorable horrors. ...the editors have provided an elegant mix of types of horror, as well as literary and artistic styles." --Maggie Thompson, Comic Buyer's Guide </p><p>"A hardcover graphic collection to lust after." --Don D'Ammassa, Science Fiction Chronicle </p><p>"Weird Business, possibly the greatest comic ever..." -Rocky Mountain News -- <i>(Rocky Mountain News)</i></p></p><h2>The Virgin in the Ice: The Sixth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael</h2><p>Brother Cadfael, sets out to find a young nun and her two wards, who have disappeared, and comes upon a desperate villain, an unusual affair of the heart, and the possible implication of his own abbey</p><p><p><strong><strong>Ellis Peters</strong></strong> (1913-1995) was the pen name of English novelist Edith Pargeter, author of scores of books under her own name. She was a recipient of the Silver Dagger Award and the Cartier Diamond Dagger Award, conferred by the Crime Writers' Association of Great Britain, as well as the coveted Edgar, awarded by the Mystery Writers of America.<strong><br></strong></p>Brother Cadfael solves the murder of a nun and is delighted to learn more about his own past. This chronicle ranks as a favorite in the series. Vanessa Benjamin carries forth Blackstone&#39;s tradition of matching the gender of the narrator to the author, rather than to the main character. When the genders of hero and narrator don&#39;t match, one gets a more old-fashioned sense of being read to, rather than hearing a performance. Benjamin relies strictly on the drama inherent in the text, subtly underscoring it with pacing and emphasis. Her minimalistic vocal shifts when reading dialogue are initially distracting, but they quickly fade into the background, as she means them to do. S.F.

Unlike most books, it doesn&#39;t have a story to read. Instead, along the bottom of each page there are prompts which teach parents/caregivers how to act out the illustrations and interact using gestures, sounds, words, or phrases depending on their child&#39;s ability. The book shows parents how to modify what they say about each illustration in order to maximize their child&#39;s communication potential. It is also filled with information which helps parents understand speech language development and it lists resources for those seeking advice. A wonderful book for young children with typical speech development and those considered &#34;late talkers&#34;.

It&#x2019;s 1925. The place: Canyon County, Idaho. Henry is sixty-seven, a retired professor and a widower who has been told a warmer climate would make the end more tolerable. San Diego would be a good choice. <br><br>Instead, Henry chose Fairhope, Alabama, a town with utopian ideals and a haven for strong-minded individualists. Upton Sinclair, Sherwood Anderson, and Clarence Darrow were among its inhabitants. Henry bought his own ten acres of piney woods outside Fairhope. Before dying, underscored by the writings of his beloved Tolstoy, Henry could begin to &#x201c;perfect the soul awarded him&#x201d; and rest in the faith that he, and all people, would succeed, &#x201c;even if it took eons.&#x201d; Human existence, Henry believed, continues in a perfect circle unmarred by flaws of personality, irrespective of blood and possessions and rank, and separate from organized religion. In Alabama, until his final breath, he would chase these high ideas.<br><br>But first, Henry had to answer up for leaving Idaho. Henry&#x2019;s dearest friend and intellectual sparring partner, Pastor Will Webb, and Henry&#x2019;s two adult sons, Thomas and Harvey, were baffled and angry that he would abandon them and move to the Deep South, living in a barn there while he built a round house of handmade concrete blocks. His new neighbors were perplexed by his eccentric behavior as well. On the coldest day of winter he was barefoot, a philosopher and poet with ideas and words to share with anyone who would listen. And, mysteriously, his &#x201c;last few months&#x201d; became years. He had gone looking for a place to learn lessons in dying, and, studiously advanced to claim a vigorous new life.<br><br><i>The Poet of Tolstoy Park </i>is a moving and irresistible story, a guidebook of the mind and spirit that lays hold of the heart. Henry Stuart points the way through life&#x2019;s puzzles for all of us, becoming in this timeless tale a character of such dimension that he seems more alive now than ever.</p><p>SONNY BREWER<b> </b>owns Over the Transom Bookshop in Fairhope and is board chairman of the nonprofit Fairhope Center for the Writing Arts.

Instead of putting on his hat, he placed the flat of his palm on his forehead and stroked the dampness accruing there. He sat down on the edge of the porch, quickly soaking the seat of his pants.<br><br>He rubbed his hands together and massaged the pain in his knuckles, then lifted his left foot and took hold of the heel of his boot and tugged it off. He straightened his back, took a breath, and in a moment crossed his right leg over stiffly and removed the other boot. Henry decided, because it was his option to do so, that he would abandon his boots. He paired them up evenly there on the boards.<br><br>Henry could not remember when last he had walked barefoot in the rain, mud squishing up between his toes. He believed it was Black Elk, or maybe Chief Seattle, who had said that the man who always wears his moccasins thinks the earth is covered with leather. Henry looked at his boots and wondered how long they would sit before someone took them. They were good Wellingtons and not badly worn, and he thought someone would be surprised to find a pair of boots on the porch at Dr. Belton&#x2019;s place.<br><br>Henry planted his palms on his knees, caressed the wet brown twill trousers, and from those points levered himself to standing. He would let his feet know that this piece of earth was covered with mud, and thought perhaps they&#x2019;d enjoy knowing that.<br><br>He tilted his face downward and was lifting his rumpled and sweat-stained felt hat when he heard his name called and, looking up, saw a horse and wagon drawing near the plank sidewalk in front of which he stood. Twenty years earlier in Nampa, Idaho, the first automobile had been delivered on a flat train car. Now in 1925 the tables were turned and only a few stubborn sorts still went about in horse-drawn carriages or wagons. This driver was among them. He sat alone on the buckboard seat, the long leather reins drawn tight in his gloved hand, making to stop his dappled gray Appaloosa. With his left hand the driver pulled back hard on the brake shaft.<br><br>&#x201c;Whoa! Whoa back there, Bo,&#x201d; the driver said.<br><br>The horse slowed his walk, its hooves sucking at the muddy street, but did not come to a stop until the wagon was dead even with Henry. This side street was one of four remaining unoiled or unpaved streets in Nampa, and some of Dr. Belton&#x2019;s patients said perhaps the dust and mud was unsanitary, but the doctor disagreed. He did not like automobiles himself, and he owned the entire block, so the town council took their pavement and their oiling elsewhere for the time being. That kept at least some of the cars away, and the smell of oil out of the air.<br><br>&#x201c;How do, Brother Webb?&#x201d; Henry nodded to the man in the wagon, then raised his arm, hat in hand, and slowly wiped the top of his head with his shirtsleeve, depositing his hat there before dropping his hand to his side. His arms hung straight, his fingers loose.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you pray up this rain, Will?&#x201d; Henry was making small talk, postponing for a moment at least what was coming. But the Reverend William Webb had been dealing with people of all stripes for forty years, and Henry knew this preacher&#x2019;s practiced eye would discern that the news from the doctor was bad. Like as not, Henry&#x2019;s two boys had made such a prediction to the preacher man. Both his sons went to this preacher&#x2019;s church, Harvey, the oldest, a regular. We might as well go ahead and get on down to the quick on this one, Henry thought.<br><br>&#x201c;Henry,&#x201d; the preacher said, rain dripping from the brim of his hat, &#x201c;Thomas and Harvey have been telling me something&#x2019;s bad wrong with you. Said you&#x2019;ve been coughing and spitting up blood and you were coming in to see the doctor this morning. I watched you go in there, and I&#x2019;ve been lying in wait like a highwayman for you to come out. Now, I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dr. Belton said it&#x2019;s consumption, Will,&#x201d; Henry said evenly. &#x201c;Tuberculosis. He&#x2019;s given me a year to live. Maybe not that long. Maybe a little more.&#x201d; Henry stood, like a patient man in line at a bank, his arms at his side. He was a tall man, just at six feet, and medium-built, his shoulders still square and his spine still straight. Nothing about him projected grave illness, and he could have passed for a man of fifty, though he was sixty-seven. His clear blue eyes locked on the dark eyes of the preacher, darker still under the soaked brim of his hat.<br><br>William Webb shook his head, then bent his face downward. When Will looked up, he said, &#x201c;I am sorry, Henry. This is a hard one, my friend.&#x201d; The preacher wrapped the reins around the brake, slid across the wet seat, taking hold of the seat back to help steady his rise. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ll let me, I&#x2019;ll pray with you, Henry. Just a brief word with the Lord.&#x201d; A big redbone hound bellied out from underneath the porch, startling the horse into a quick forward step, snatching the wagon. The preacher lurched and fell back, sitting down hard on the wagon seat. &#x201c;Aw, Bo, damn your hide!&#x201d;<br><br>Henry smiled. &#x201c;Keep your seat, Reverend.&#x201d; He watched the old hound trot across the street, going diagonally toward the alley that would take him behind the Melton Hotel, and perhaps a scrap of bread raked off a breakfast plate. The morning fell darker, and there was a low roll of thunder toward the hills east of town, and the rain fell harder. Henry turned his collar up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let you know when I need a prayer lifted on my behalf, though I do appreciate your intent, Brother Webb.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can I at least give you a ride back out to your place? This muck&#x2019;ll ruin your boots.&#x201d; The preacher let his eyes travel slowly down to Henry&#x2019;s long bare feet. &#x201c;Well, that is, when you put your boots back on. I&#x2019;ve got to go in that direction, Henry, and I&#x2019;d not think a thing of carting you to your front gate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s to the Pearly Gates you truly want to cart me. I have known you for too long, Will. You&#x2019;ll never give up. You would talk all the way and make half a dozen altar calls.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I expect there&#x2019;d not be time for half a dozen entreaties mean- ingful enough to rescue that starving soul of yours.&#x201d; Preacher Webb propped a booted foot on the buckboard&#x2019;s dash, caught the wet and wilted brim of his hat and tilted it back a bit for a better look at Henry James Stuart. &#x201c;I worry about you, Henry, staying away from the church like we&#x2019;ve got out a quarantine sign. Both your sons come as often as we open the doors. Don&#x2019;t you think Molly would want you in the church with her boys?&#x201d;<br><br>Henry braced his shoulders and closed his hands, though not tight into fists. &#x201c;Molly did want me to go to church. With her. And I went, glad to go for the pleasure it seemed to give to her. But, Will, Molly is dead three years now, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you have not darkened the door of my church one time since she passed, Henry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nor shall I, Will. We don&#x2019;t really have to talk about this again, do we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But do you not fear for your soul now that you&#x2019;ll soon face the Almighty?&#x201d; The preacher sat straighter, still holding up the brim of his hat.<br><br>&#x201c;My face has never turned away from God, nor my ear ever inclined away from his counsel. You do not stand between me and my creator, Will Webb. It seems a prideful thing to suggest, and a touch arrogant.&#x201d;<br><br>Preacher Webb took his foot from the dash and banged it down on the puddled floorboard, leaning forward to unwrap the reins. &#x201c;And you are the stubbornest man in all of Idaho, Henry. My prayer is that you get a chance to argue your name onto Heaven&#x2019;s roll, for you could argue the horns off a goat.&#x201d; The rain quickly eased and almost stopped, and both men looked briefly toward the sky, as if to find the cause of the lull.<br><br>&#x201c;Since you have got it going this morning, Will, let me argue with you for half a minute,&#x201d; Henry said, drawing his bushy white eyebrows together in a frown. &#x201c;Let me tell you how I believe that all the names of all the people in all the ages are written forever on that roll you speak of. How I believe that when our Maker claims what is his at the birth of a child and duly records it in his Book of Life, that little one becomes a divine property that neither foe nor force nor deed can steal.&#x201d;<br><br>Henry lifted his hands, a questioning gesture. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you get your preacher&#x2019;s heart to believe that what was ever once God&#x2019;s is always God&#x2019;s? It&#x2019;s simple to me. There is nothing that can oppose the creative force of the universe. There is nowhere to get to, Will, if you never truly left. It&#x2019;s because you and others of your ilk cannot even approach such an idea that I have no need of what you&#x2019;re selling at the churchhouse, Will.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is your &#x2018;Everybody Gets Back to Heaven&#x2019; sermon. I&#x2019;ve heard it before, Henry.&#x201d; The reverend held the reins one in each hand, and was bent forward slightly with his forearms resting on his heavy thighs. &#x201c;Come on, Henry. What a load of bull. I don&#x2019;t know how they graduated you from Mount Union. Must&#x2019;ve been an off year for them in their divinity department to turn you loose among good Baptists.&#x201d;<br><br>Henry shook his head, but smiled. He had first laid out his theology to Will Webb on one of their fishing afternoons down at a favorite spot on Lake Lowell. It was after Aldus Sansing, a man well known to Henry, had been cut down with a double-barreled shotgun during a robbery and had died without officially &#x201c;coming to the Lord&#x201d; on a Sunday morning. Aldus never went there.

Only one thing is certain?Darren's initiation into the vampire clan is more deadly than he can ever have imagined.</p><p>Darren Shan was born in London but at an early age he moved to Limerick, Ireland, with his parents and younger brother. He grew up watching old Dracula horror movies and reading spooky comics, which were the inspirations for this series. Vampire Mountain is his fourth novel in The Saga of Darren Shan.<br>Grade 5-8-Darren Shan, the loquacious vampire's assistant, narrates another blood-and-guts tale. Having tracked a horror-movie-stereotype vampire in their previous adventure, Darren and his master, Larten Crepsley, take another hiatus from the bizarre circus of the series title to make a pilgrimage to the Halls of Vampire Mountain to meet with the generals and princes in charge. The peregrinators are accompanied by a pair of ugly, speechless Little People who carry an ominous message for the council from their "old as time itself" master, Mr. Tiny. The road is perilous, of course, and getting to their destination is only half of the problem. Darren's biggest challenge, following a run-in with a crazed grizzly bear and a foolhardy confrontation with a rare, Xena-like vampiress, comes in defending his maker, the one who inexplicably violated the proscription against blooding a child. While the previous trio of "Cirque du Freak" books could each relatively stand alone, this fourth entry marks a definite transition, a critical segue into adventures to come that will revolve around Mr. Tiny's foreboding and Darren's impending Trials of Initiation (book nine is already in the works in the U.K.).

Mitropoulos was a passionate advocate of difficult modern music and an early champion of Mahler; his emotionally charged performances brought the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra into the first rank of American orchestras. Generous and self-effacing, he was an innocent in the game of musical politics, unprepared for the intrigues and treachery in store when he became music director of the New York Philharmonic, &#x201c;the orchestra that took no prisoners.&#x201d;</p><p>At the time of his death, Dimitri Mitropoulos (1896-1960) was considered one of the most brilliant conductors of the twentieth century. Yet within a decade, his achievements were largely forgotten. An ascetic and mystic throughout his life, Mitropoulos was attracted in his youth to the monastic life, and he brought the same fervent passion to music. He studied in Rome, Brussels, and Berlin, but his career flowered in his native Greece, where he developed his trademark style of conducting without a baton - or score. Success did not change his essential simplicity and boundless generosity, and he never aspired to the glamorous trappings of celebrity. His story unfolds against the rich backdrop of the Golden Age of conductors and reveals secret wars among musicians, patrons, promoters, and critics. Based upon extensive research by the late musicologist Oliver Daniel, this radiant account of a tragically noble and neglected giant promises to be the most important musical biography of the decade.William R.

Throughout his long and arduous trek, he encountered a variety of people who inhabit the Japanese countryside&#x2014;from fishermen and soldiers, to bar hostesses and school teachers, to hermits, drunks, and tramps. His wonderful and often hilarious descriptions of these encounters are the highlights of these pages, painting a multifaceted picture of Japan from the perspective of an outsider, but with the knowledge of an insider.<br><i>The Roads to Sata</i> is travel writing at its best, illuminating and disarming, poignant yet hilarious, critical but respectful.

And how did America achieve such dominance in management for so long? &#34;The Puritan Gift&#34; traces the origins and the characteristics of American managerial culture which, in the course of three centuries, turned a group of small colonies into the greatest economic and political power on earth. It argues that the drive, energy and acceptance of innovation, competition, growth and social mobility, all of which lie at the root of America&#39;s management culture, have their origins in the discipline and ethos of America&#39;s first wave of European immigrants: the Puritans.And, the authors warn, as Americans distance themselves from the core values which produced their business and economic successes during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, they put their future prosperity and security at risk. This is an original exploration of the dramatic and far-reaching consequences of the Puritans&#39; &#39;gift&#39; to America - the ethos which produced the early success of America and what came to be known as the American dream.</p><p>Kenneth Hopper has been active throughout his professional life as a writer on industrial affairs and a consultant in both the U.S.A. and Europe.

The journey he makes to Circle City, Alaska, is more than a voyage into northern wilderness, it is an expedition into the history of the river and a record of the inimitable inhabitants of the region, historic and contemporary. A literary kin of John Muir's <i>Travels in Alaska </i>and John McPhee's <i>Coming into the Country</i>, <i>A Land Gone Lonesome </i>is the book on Alaska for the new century. Though he treks through a beautiful and hostile wilderness, the heart of O'Neill's story is his exploration of the lives of a few tough souls clinging to the old ways-even as government policies are extinguishing their way of life. More than just colorful anachronisms, these wilderness dwellers-both men and women-are a living archive of North American pioneer values. As O'Neill encounters these natives, he finds himself drawn into the bare-knuckle melodrama of frontier life-and further back still into the very origins of the Yukon river world. With the rare perspective of an insider, O'Neill here gives us an intelligent, lyrical-and ultimately, probably the last-portrait of the river people along the upper Yukon.</p><p><b>PRAISE FOR A LAND GONE LONESOME</b> <p> <i>A New York Times Book Review</i> "Editor's Choice" </p><p> Winner: 2006 Outstanding Alaskan of the Year Award, Alaska Library Association </p><p> "Journeying with [O'Neill] through the remnants of a once-vital backwoods society, one comes to understand that a wilderness should be a home to people as well as to salmon, moose, and bear."--<i>Natural History</i> (September 2006) </p><p> "O'Neill casts a mold on the Yukon landscape before nature takes back the last human footprint... to O'Neill, it's only fair to leave the scrappy individualists...not only for their sake, but for ours: to leave a little something for the American imagination, an elemental way of life that is lonely and lovely and very nearly gone."--<i>New York Times Book Review</i> (8/13/06) </p><p> "There are good stories here, well told... O'Neill does all this in clear, crisp, and evocative prose, with the reader able to see, hear, and sometimes even smell the characters. As in his earlier books, O'Neill also demonstrates a rare gift for describing in quick and imaginative prose natural phenomena and scientific or mechanical processes."--<i>National Review</i> (7/3/06) </p><p> "O'Neill spent probably half his life living, researching and finally writing this book. His love and concern for our great state, Alaska, pour out poetry on the page. This is the story of Alaska vanishing into 21st century America."--Seth Kantner, <i>Salon.com</i> </p><p> "<i>A Land Gone Lonesome</i> is an excellent account of contemporary Alaska, enlivened by O'Neill's accounts of the people he met along the Yukon."--<i>The Oregonian</i> (6/16/06) </p><p> "O'Neill is a talented historian...

Alaskan O'Neill (<i>The Last Giant of Beringia</i>) canoes along this waterway from Dawson, Yukon Territory, to Circle City, AK. The stops along the way initiate tales of the gold rush, salmon, fur trapping, dog sledding, subsistence living, and other aspects of life unique to the Alaskan wilds... Like John McPhee's <i>Coming into the Country</i>, to which O'Neill refers throughout, this is the human history of a place where few people have ever lived."--<i>Library Journal</i> (5/1/06) </p><p> "Canadian author Pierre Burton and poet Robert W. Service each famously chronicled their homes in Dawson, Yukon Territory. In 1937, Ernie Pyle visited Eagle, Alaska, and 40 years later John McPhee wrote of Eagle in his widely praised <i>Coming Into the Country</i>. Now O'Neill bravely goes where those men have gone before; his journal of his own voyage of rediscovery is equally wonderful....Whether it's about boats or eagles or hardy trappers, whether it commemorates a monumental dog race or celebrates the magnanimous code of the prospectors of the Yukon Territory and the 49th state, the reportage is cool and bright as the flowing waters of the Yukon. Another writerly gold strike in the Klondike."--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (4/15/06) </p><p> "Outdoorsman O'Neill (<i>The Last Giant of Beringia</i>) steers his canoe through the history and topography of the Yukon River, which runs through Canada and Alaska, letting its course carry his witty travelogue....

The accessible, straightforward, and practical books in the <i>Overcoming</i> series treat disorders by changing unhelpful patterns of behavior and thought. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was developed by psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck and is now internationally favored as a practical means of overcoming longstanding and disabling conditions, both psychological and physical. CBT insists that our <i>thoughts</i> cause our feelings and behaviors. Even when our situation does not change, if we change the self-defeating ways we think, we can make ourselves feel better. This positive, pragmatic approach is popular with therapists and patients alike.Books in the <i>Overcoming</i> Series: highlight the history and background of the disorder, who is likely to be affected, and what the main symptoms are provide a structure ideal for personal use or in a program using guided self-help techniques include diagnostic questionnaires, case studies, and workbook-style interactive exercises explore step-by-step techniques such as diary- and record-keeping, problem-solving, and managing symptoms include overviews of all treatment options offer authoritative, commonsense solutions to pervasive, difficult emotional problems are highly recommended by experts around the world and offer readers an affordable and easy-to-follow treatment plan</p><p><p>Gillian Butler is a consultant clinical psychologist and Fellow of the British Psychological Society.

Just as women have to overcome the patriarchal tyrant in their own souls, men have to liberate and differentiate their inner femininity. Only then will a better relationship of the sexes be possible." It is this timely theme that Dr. von Franz explores in her psychological study of a classic work of the second century, <i>The Golden Ass </i> by Apuleius of Madaura. The novel recounts the adventures of a young Roman who is transformed into an ass and eventually finds spiritual renewal through initiation into the Isis mysteries. With its many tales within a tale (including the celebrated story of Psyche and Eros), the text as interpreted by Dr. von Franz is a rich source of insights, anecdotes, and scholarly amplification.</p><p></p><h2>Cargo of Eagles</h2><p>Albert Campion and his American friend visit Saltey, an old pirate&#39;s town on the English coast now plagued with modern-day disreputable characters, to unravel a murder connected to a hundred-year-old legend and a missing treasure</p><p>Margery Allingham was a prolific writer who sold her first story at age eight and published her first novel before turning twenty.

It&#39;s not only a notorious smugglers&#39; haven, but also a dangerous backwater linked with tales of demons, pirates and murder. Allingham&#39;s hero, Albert Campion, has a secret interest in the place as do an American historian and a beautiful doctor. This is a fine, old-fashioned English mystery with classic twists in plot and colorful, local characters. Matthews does far more than read the tale; he dramatizes the action, as well. It&#39;s hard to believe one actor creates so many different voices. Each character, from the arrogant young bikers to the suave Mr. Campion, is perfectly portrayed with just the right intonation and accent. Listeners will delight in their visit to Salty. D.L.G.
